hba1c is a commonly used diabetes term,0.89,5.05,5.9399999999999995,neutral
so it's important to understand what it,4.02,3.96,7.9799999999999995,neutral
means and the role it plays in modern,5.94,3.409,9.349,neutral
diabetes care,7.98,4.86,12.84,neutral
simply put hba1c readings are an average,9.349,5.17,14.519,neutral
measurement of how well controlled,12.84,3.63,16.47,surprise
glucose levels have been over the last,14.519,3.201,17.72,surprise
two to three months,16.47,4.77,21.24,neutral
the term hba1c refers to glice ated,17.72,5.979,23.698999999999998,neutral
hemoglobin which is a molecule that,21.24,4.41,25.65,fear
forms when glucose joins with the,23.699,4.08,27.779000000000003,fear
protein in the red blood cells that's,25.65,5.82,31.47,neutral
known as hemoglobin to test for hba1c a,27.779,6.12,33.899,neutral
doctor will take a blood sample usually,31.47,4.44,35.91,neutral
from the arm and use it to measure how,33.899,4.201,38.1,neutral
much glucose has stuck to the hemoglobin,35.91,5.579,41.489,neutral
in the bloodstream hemoglobin molecules,38.1,5.19,43.29,neutral
tend to live 812 weeks,41.489,4.861,46.349999999999994,neutral
so by taking a hba1c measurement you get,43.29,4.98,48.269999999999996,neutral
a long-term trend of how high or low,46.35,4.139,50.489000000000004,neutral
blood sugar levels have been over that,48.27,4.769,53.039,neutral

with diabetes is scatter hba1c reading,53.039,5.941,58.980000000000004,neutral
of under 6.5 percent the results are,55.8,4.829,60.629,neutral
either expressed as a percentage as,58.98,4.29,63.269999999999996,neutral
millimoles per mole in which case you're,60.629,5.301,65.92999999999999,neutral
aiming for under 48 millimoles per mole,63.27,5.25,68.52000000000001,neutral
some people will be set less challenging,65.93,4.93,70.86000000000001,neutral
targets by their doctor especially if,68.52,4.43,72.94999999999999,neutral
they have a history of hypoglycemia,70.86,4.649,75.509,neutral
generally speaking the lower your hba1c,72.95,4.989,77.93900000000001,neutral
reading is the better your blood glucose,75.509,4.411,79.92,neutral

there will be a lower risk of developing,79.92,4.589,84.509,neutral
serious long-term complications large,81.39,4.619,86.009,neutral
scale studies have shown that people,84.509,3.621,88.13,neutral
with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes,86.009,5.161,91.17,neutral
who managed to lower their hba1c reading,88.13,6.43,94.56,neutral
by just 1% or 11 millimoles or mul can,91.17,4.68,95.85,neutral
drastically reduce their chance of,94.56,3.78,98.34,neutral
developing long-term complications this,95.85,5.22,101.07,neutral

cataracts and heart failure you should,103.829,5.07,108.899,neutral
have your hba1c tested at least once a,106.86,4.5,111.36,neutral
year in most cases your GP can do this,108.899,4.11,113.009,neutral
