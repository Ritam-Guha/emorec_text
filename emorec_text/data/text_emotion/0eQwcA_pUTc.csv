about 50% of diabetics are not presently,4.5,6.539,11.039,fear
being screened in a timely fashion so,8.34,7.23,15.57,fear
often it goes undiagnosed and this is,11.039,7.08,18.119,fear
the big challenge for the healthcare,15.57,4.77,20.34,fear
system is to figure out more efficient,18.119,5.431,23.55,fear
ways to get patients screened presently,20.34,5.13,25.47,fear
they need to make an appointment with an,23.55,4.799,28.349,fear
ophthalmologist which tends to be a,25.47,4.799,30.269,fear
barrier to care because just another,28.349,4.14,32.489,fear
appointment these diabetics have to go,30.269,3.931,34.199999999999996,fear
to they're already seeing many doctors,32.489,3.241,35.73,fear
whether it be for kidney problems or,34.2,3.6,37.800000000000004,fear
just general care and the last thing,35.73,3.21,38.94,fear
they want to do is go see an eye doctor,37.8,3.45,41.25,fear
and they're not having any symptoms,38.94,4.23,43.17,fear
that's why what's really starting to,41.25,4.86,46.11,fear
become a standard treatment is this idea,43.17,4.86,48.03,fear
of screening patients in the primary,46.11,4.29,50.4,fear
care doctors office or the diet ologist,48.03,4.32,52.35,fear
office with cameras and that's really,50.4,5.94,56.339999999999996,fear
kind of becoming the norm it's a way to,52.35,6.81,59.160000000000004,fear
screen diabetics one takes a picture of,56.34,4.68,61.02,fear
their back of their eye those pictures,59.16,3.27,62.43,fear
are typically read by a retina,61.02,3.209,64.229,fear
specialist in the future,62.43,4.619,67.049,fear
augmented intelligence is going to be,64.229,3.93,68.159,fear
reading those as well,67.049,2.671,69.72000000000001,fear
so we're able to screen a lot more,68.159,3.301,71.46000000000001,fear
patients in a much more patient friendly,69.72,4.05,73.77,fear
manner turna they're not having to show,71.46,3.9,75.36,fear
up to another doctor having to pay,73.77,4.02,77.78999999999999,fear
another copay these things tend to be,75.36,5.76,81.12,fear
barriers to care or as screening,77.79,5.76,83.55000000000001,fear
programs in the primary care doctors,81.12,4.08,85.2,fear
offices are becoming more and more,83.55,4.8,88.35,fear
commonplace I know in the city I work,85.2,4.62,89.82000000000001,fear
and it really has become the standard,88.35,3.69,92.03999999999999,fear
way to screen many diabetics that,89.82,5.07,94.88999999999999,fear
presently are not being screened with,92.04,4.56,96.60000000000001,fear
their own general ophthalmologists or,94.89,3.03,97.92,fear
optometrists wherever they're high care,96.6,3.84,100.44,fear
specialists is so I think in the future,97.92,4.739,102.659,fear
because there's such an epidemic there,100.44,3.63,104.07,fear
such an increase in the number of,102.659,3.871,106.53,fear
diabetics the only way they're all gonna,104.07,3.96,108.02999999999999,fear
be able to be screened is through these,106.53,4.01,110.54,fear
larger screening programs using,108.03,5.339,113.369,fear
technology using cameras in primary care,110.54,4.66,115.2,fear
doctors offices to screen these patients,113.369,5.371,118.74,fear
those that have disease then are sent to,115.2,6.209,121.409,fear
the eye care specialist who specializes,118.74,5.07,123.81,fear
in managing diabetic eye disease and,121.409,4.021,125.43,sad
that way they're taking care of those,123.81,3.87,127.68,fear
patients their clinics aren't clogged up,125.43,4.68,130.11,fear
by screening patients because they're,127.68,4.169,131.84900000000002,sad
already being screened so we as the,130.11,3.93,134.04000000000002,sad
retina surgeons are able to manage the,131.849,4.231,136.07999999999998,fear
patients that actually have disease so,134.04,3.809,137.849,fear
everyone wins in that situation so I,136.08,3.33,139.41000000000003,fear
think you're gonna see more and more of,137.849,3.451,141.29999999999998,fear
what's term telemedicine or tell a,139.41,3.99,143.4,fear
retinal screening goes by several names,141.3,4.47,145.77,fear
and it's really a very cost efficient,143.4,4.35,147.75,fear
way to screen patients and to prevent,145.77,3.9,149.67000000000002,fear
them from having vision loss typically,147.75,4.56,152.31,fear
patients as mentioned ideally we want to,149.67,4.11,153.78,fear
see them before they have any signs and,152.31,3.929,156.239,fear
symptoms but patients if they start,153.78,4.74,158.52,fear
developing gradual visual blurring those,156.239,4.411,160.65,surprise
that have diabetic macular oedema tend,158.52,5.04,163.56,fear
to get gradual loss and vision central,160.65,5.699,166.34900000000002,fear
vision in in one eye or both eyes at a,163.56,5.94,169.5,fear
time often pages will present with a,166.349,5.521,171.86999999999998,sad
sudden onset of floaters which is a very,169.5,4.23,173.73,sad
common symptom however in diabetics,171.87,3.39,175.26,sad
there's always a concern that those,173.73,3.089,176.819,fear
floaters are caused by hemorrhaging or,175.26,3.18,178.44,fear
bleeding it in the bet in the back of,176.819,3.301,180.11999999999998,fear
the eye and the vitreous cavity which,178.44,3.629,182.069,fear
can cause these floaters sometimes,180.12,3.36,183.48000000000002,fear
patients will present with a sudden,182.069,3.841,185.91,fear
vision loss due to a large vitreous,183.48,4.32,187.79999999999998,fear
hemorrhage which can cause dramatic drop,185.91,3.99,189.9,fear
in vision in a matter of seconds or,187.8,4.26,192.06,fear
minutes where patients say hey I saw a,189.9,4.5,194.4,fear
shower of floaters and they increase and,192.06,5.13,197.19,fear
suddenly everything was very hazy and it,194.4,5.01,199.41,fear
happened maybe I woke up with no vision,197.19,4.08,201.27,fear
of my eye or or they were doing,199.41,3.45,202.85999999999999,fear
something outside and they started,201.27,2.88,204.15,fear
noticing a bunch of stuff floating in,202.86,3.09,205.95000000000002,fear
their vision and it started clouding up,204.15,3.54,207.69,fear
and that's a typical vitreous hemorrhage,205.95,3.81,209.76,fear
will cause that type of symptoms whereas,207.69,3.84,211.53,surprise
the diabetic macular edema is a much,209.76,3.809,213.569,fear
more gradual loss of vision of central,211.53,5.789,217.319,fear
blurring without associated vitreous,213.569,5.67,219.23899999999998,fear
hemorrhage some studies there's a lot of,217.319,4.831,222.14999999999998,fear
data out there some people believe that,219.239,4.89,224.129,fear
about 10% of diabetics will lose their,222.15,2.369,224.519,fear
vision,224.129,2.911,227.04,fear
recent studies suggest that that numbers,224.519,5.071,229.59,fear
increasing because patients are not,227.04,4.86,231.9,fear
getting timely care with the increased,229.59,4.74,234.33,fear
number of diabetic patients in the,231.9,5.759,237.659,fear
limited healthcare access to health care,234.33,4.76,239.09,fear
we're seeing more and more patients,237.659,4.08,241.739,fear
treated later in their disease which is,239.09,4.119,243.209,fear
tragic because we actually have better,241.739,3.241,244.98000000000002,fear
treatments today than we've ever had and,243.209,4.981,248.19,fear
those that get timely care we can,244.98,6.649,251.629,fear
prevent them from losing any vision,248.19,3.439,251.629,fear
