[Music] hello I'm dr. knees go - welcome to another initiative wound care window another patient I'd like to share with you and illustrate again some teaching,6.58,22.669,29.249000000000002,NA
points about diabetic foot ulcers off-loading in callus formation I have a patient I'd like to talk to you about she presented with diabetic foot ulcer I'm going to show you an image from,23.25,22.739,45.989000000000004,NA
October 17 this is the ulcer you'll notice on the photo and she was managed with the total contact casting and didn't really quite well her last visit to the center was January 9th you can,33.719,23.85,57.569,NA
see that she healed very nicely with aggressive offloading utilizing total contact cast after that time we transitioned her to orthotics and inserts as typically is accomplishing,46.559,25.08,71.639,NA
these patients or the standard of carry these inserts are custom designed for the patient to fit her foot and fit into a pair of shoes that can have a wide toe base and they're very soft these inserts,58.62,23.330000000000002,81.95,NA
you'll note are designed to provide offloading to the area of injury and prior ulcer is a ulceration so her last visit to the center was January January and she's done fairly well in the past,70.229,28.061,98.28999999999999,NA
with these inserts we advise these patients to return frequently for evaluation of possible callus formation so that we can pair that callus down and prevent the disasters that can't occur,84.6,23.79,108.38999999999999,NA
with callus formation she has not returned in four weeks but does come in today so today I'm showing you the prior area of injury and you'll see that she has some fairly extensive callus built,96.09,30.148000000000003,126.238,NA
up in this area we know the risks to these patients when we do have callus formation we can have sub callus hemorrhage fluid accumulation and a more concern the development of infection so,110.909,30.151000000000003,141.06,NA
I'm gonna unroofed this area open up fine if there's any type of infection underneath this find out the extent of injury under the cows but you can see,126.719,24.161,150.88,NA
this callus is the bane of our existence as wound care providers taking care of patients with diabetic foot ulcers so let's go ahead and open that calloused area so in evaluating the area I do feel,138.71,23.009999999999998,161.72,NA
a callus I feel that this she was somewhat boggy underneath it she's got a little rent in the callus right here and we can stick a forceps in and actually lift that area and I'm gonna go ahead,150.56,28.53,179.09,NA
and unroofed the callus with sharp dissection the technique I'm using is one you've seen in the past inserting the Irish scissor blades under the callus getting to the margin and open,163.01,41.519999999999996,204.52999999999997,NA
easy a little hemorrhage around and now you get an appreciation of just how thick that dermis is that callus formation isolate the cavity under the callus by using my iris blades dissect,183.26,44.53,227.79,NA
work our way all the way around once again you'll see the Calais where that little rent was I just don't think that can get so after we unroofed the area we evaluate it the good thing I'm,220.92,36.089999999999996,257.01,NA
seeing is no evidence of franc tissue necrosis I think we caught this fairly early we do have a little lip here of some additional callus we'll take down and there might also be an extension yes,247.26,30.37,277.63,NA
there is a little extension this way but the tissue is viable I don't see any evidence of perience which is certainly good the redness that you see then around the site is largely due to,266.16,28.311000000000003,294.471,NA
inflammatory responses rather than Frank infectious processes I find no crepitus in this tissue at all and that's fairly soft all the way around I'm a pretty good job of evacuating so I hope you've,284.4,30.970000000000002,315.37,NA
enjoyed this edition of the wound care window this patient will be discharged in a total contact cast again we're going to need to protect it least we'll have that discussion with her see her,301.03,22.08,323.10999999999996,NA
fairly frequently for the management and quite confident we get this healed again but again this issue stresses the importance of monitoring diabetic feet for callus formation making sure they're,311.8,25.62,337.42,NA
appropriately offloaded and when callus does appear to be very aggressive in managing that callus formation we'll see you next time Thanks [Music],324.58,30.39,354.96999999999997,NA
you [Music],339.78,5.24,345.02,NA
