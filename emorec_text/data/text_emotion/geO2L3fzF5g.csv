"- Hi. I'm Bob Eckel at the
University of Colorado,",5.602,2.114,7.716,sad
"Anschutz Medical Campus in
Aurora just east of Denver,",7.716,3.564,11.280000000000001,sad
and I'm here to report on a publication,11.28,3.204,14.484,NA
"just released by the
American Heart Association",14.484,2.543,17.027,NA
that deals with cardiovascular disease,17.027,2.6,19.627000000000002,angry
"in patients with type 1 diabetes,",19.627,2.45,22.076999999999998,angry
"I was the senior author
on a multi-authored paper",22.077,2.763,24.840000000000003,angry
"that Sarah de Ferranti from
the Boston Children's Hospital",24.84,4.234,29.073999999999998,angry
assumed the role of the first author.,29.074,2.233,31.307000000000002,angry
The purpose of this manuscript really is,31.307,2.601,33.908,angry
to bring to light the fact that,33.908,2.055,35.963,angry
"cardiovascular disease in
patients with type 1 diabetes",35.963,2.728,38.691,angry
"may not be the same entity
that it is in type 2 diabetes.",38.691,4.296,42.987,angry
"Now I should point out, too,",42.987,1.23,44.217,angry
"the American Diabetes Association
teamed up with the AHA",44.217,2.345,46.562,angry
"on this document, so it's been reviewed",46.562,1.741,48.303,angry
by both organizations.,48.303,2.033,50.336,angry
But I think a couple of the key points,50.336,1.764,52.1,angry
"that we want to bring that
we want to bring forth",52.1,0.9,53.0,angry
on this manuscript is:,53.0,2.31,55.31,angry
"number one,
Are their risk factors",55.31,1.585,56.895,angry
"the same?
And they may not be.",56.895,2.52,59.415000000000006,angry
"Other than duration of diabetes,",59.415,2.019,61.434,angry
"and perhaps hypertension,",61.434,2.114,63.547999999999995,angry
"and perhaps glucose control,
that could be debated,",63.548,3.718,67.266,angry
"the risk factors for atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease",67.266,2.74,70.006,angry
and type 1 are quite a bit different.,70.006,1.822,71.828,angry
The lipids are very different.,71.828,1.672,73.5,angry
Patients with type 1 diabetes,73.5,1.544,75.044,angry
"have higher levels of HDL cholesterol,",75.044,2.587,77.631,angry
"but yet, they have a burden
of cardiovascular disease,",77.631,2.996,80.627,angry
particularly the atherosclerotic form.,80.627,1.996,82.62299999999999,angry
Why is that?,82.623,1.033,83.656,angry
Is the HDL not working correctly?,83.656,2.566,86.22200000000001,angry
"Or, in fact, is the high HDL, in fact,",86.222,2.763,88.985,NA
"dysfunctional, in fact, causing harm?",88.985,2.543,91.528,angry
I don't think we have an answer to that.,91.528,2.194,93.72200000000001,angry
What are the other risk factors,93.722,1.394,95.116,angry
"that relate the atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease",95.116,1.996,97.112,angry
and type 1 diabetes?,97.112,1.057,98.169,angry
This manuscript really reviews,98.169,1.614,99.783,angry
all the potential risk factors,99.783,1.521,101.304,NA
"and brings you up to date on that,",101.304,2.078,103.382,NA
but really reveals the fact that,103.382,1.439,104.821,NA
we don't know a lot about the,104.821,1.103,105.92399999999999,NA
"atherosclerotic disease in
patients with type 1 diabetes.",105.924,3.681,109.605,angry
"Another area is the plaque.
Is the plaque the same?",109.605,2.821,112.426,angry
Is it so lipid laden?,112.426,2.101,114.527,angry
"And not only is HDL higher
in type 1 diabetic patients,",114.527,3.402,117.929,angry
"but actually LDL
cholesterols are the same,",117.929,1.916,119.845,angry
or lower.,119.845,0.94,120.785,angry
Triglycerides are almost never abnormal,120.785,2.124,122.90899999999999,angry
"unless control is pitifully,
poorly controlled.",122.909,2.973,125.882,angry
"I think we've got these issues
related to the plaque itself.",125.882,2.948,128.83,angry
Maybe the plaque is less lipid laden.,128.83,2.973,131.80300000000003,angry
I think one hypothesis is the plaque,131.803,2.101,133.904,angry
"is more calcified, more fibrotic,",133.904,1.951,135.855,angry
"and may actually be more
stable in patients with type 1.",135.855,3.042,138.897,angry
Is the disease the same?,138.897,2.136,141.033,angry
"Another area is the acute
coronary syndrome setting.",141.033,3.878,144.911,angry
When the late George Eisenbarth and I,144.911,1.66,146.571,angry
"did an editorial actually
in translational science",146.571,3.703,150.274,angry
"before George left us,
unfortunately prematurely,",150.274,3.542,153.816,angry
"we brought up the fact that
the acute coronary syndrome",153.816,2.255,156.071,angry
"has never actually been
studied in type 1 patients.",156.071,3.622,159.69299999999998,angry
Everything that links diabetes to,159.693,1.855,161.548,angry
cardiovascular disease is type 2.,161.548,2.38,163.928,angry
"But, in fact, what the group at the Joslin",163.928,1.729,165.657,angry
has identified is that after a,165.657,1.859,167.51600000000002,angry
"myocardial infarction on
a mass model in type 1,",167.516,3.017,170.533,angry
"there is a antibody mediated
myocarditis developed.",170.533,3.832,174.36499999999998,angry
"But, when George and I wrote the editorial",174.365,2.044,176.40900000000002,angry
"we couldn't find any evidence
the acute coronoary syndrome",176.409,2.821,179.23,angry
has actually been studied well,179.23,1.834,181.064,angry
in patients with type 1 diabetes.,181.064,1.753,182.81699999999998,angry
"In fact, is there an
antibody mediated myocarditis",182.817,3.645,186.46200000000002,angry
that results in a greater likelihood,186.462,1.696,188.158,angry
"of congestive heart failure
and the acute coronary syndrome",188.158,2.542,190.7,angry
"in patients with type 1?
We don't know.",190.7,2.996,193.696,angry
"Finally, interventions in
type 1 just haven't ensued.",193.696,3.599,197.295,angry
What about statin trials in type 1?,197.295,2.113,199.408,angry
When did we start a type 1 child,199.408,1.962,201.36999999999998,angry
with type 1 diabetes on a statin?,201.37,2.357,203.727,angry
What about anti-hypertensive therapy,203.727,2.067,205.794,angry
and cardiovascular disease outcomes,205.794,1.938,207.732,angry
in patients with type 1?,207.732,1.556,209.288,angry
I think what the manuscript does,209.288,1.498,210.786,angry
"is really reveal these
absent areas of knowledge",210.786,3.97,214.756,angry
about type 1 diabetes and how it relates,214.756,2.078,216.834,NA
"to coronary heart disease, and
peripheral vascular disease,",216.834,2.532,219.366,NA
"and stroke in patients
with type 1 diabetes.",219.366,3.123,222.489,NA
"In fact, I think what
we've learned from this",222.489,1.926,224.415,NA
"is that there's so many
unanswered questions",224.415,2.38,226.795,NA
"that when I was at a meeting
at the NIDDK in the last year,",226.795,4.83,231.625,NA
"ultimately I brought to
the attention to NIDDK",231.625,2.822,234.447,NA
"that this area really needs more science,",234.447,2.29,236.737,NA
"and, in fact, what's
happened subsequent to that",236.737,3.015,239.75199999999998,NA
"is that NHOBI and NIDDK are
sponsoring a joint symposium,",239.752,4.761,244.513,NA
"a workshop, on coronary
disease and type 1 diabetes",244.513,3.668,248.181,NA
that's going to take place this October.,248.181,2.636,250.817,NA
We're excited about the opportunity,250.817,1.683,252.5,NA
to bring scientists from around the world,252.5,1.951,254.451,NA
"together on a topic that's
been poorly studied,",254.451,2.74,257.191,NA
and I think this manuscript in circulation,257.191,3.204,260.395,NA
really highlights the need for additional,260.395,2.543,262.938,NA
"science and medicine in
this particular area.",262.938,3.75,266.688,NA
