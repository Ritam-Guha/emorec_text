"- Hi. I'm Bob Eckel at the
University of Colorado, Anschutz Medical Campus in
Aurora just east of Denver, and I'm here to report on a publication just released by the
American Heart Association that deals with cardiovascular disease",5.602,14.025,19.627000000000002,NA
"in patients with type 1 diabetes, I was the senior author
on a multi-authored paper that Sarah de Ferranti from
the Boston Children's Hospital assumed the role of the first author. The purpose of this manuscript really is",19.627,14.280999999999999,33.908,NA
"to bring to light the fact that cardiovascular disease in
patients with type 1 diabetes may not be the same entity
that it is in type 2 diabetes. Now I should point out, too, the American Diabetes Association
teamed up with the AHA",33.908,12.654000000000002,46.562000000000005,NA
"on this document, so it's been reviewed by both organizations. But I think a couple of the key points that we want to bring that
we want to bring forth on this manuscript is:",46.562,8.748000000000001,55.31,NA
"number one,
Are their risk factors the same?
And they may not be. Other than duration of diabetes, and perhaps hypertension, and perhaps glucose control,
that could be debated,",55.31,11.956,67.266,NA
"the risk factors for atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease and type 1 are quite a bit different. The lipids are very different. Patients with type 1 diabetes have higher levels of HDL cholesterol,",67.266,10.365,77.631,NA
"but yet, they have a burden
of cardiovascular disease, particularly the atherosclerotic form. Why is that? Is the HDL not working correctly? Or, in fact, is the high HDL, in fact,",77.631,11.354000000000001,88.985,NA
"dysfunctional, in fact, causing harm? I don't think we have an answer to that. What are the other risk factors that relate the atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease and type 1 diabetes?",88.985,9.184000000000001,98.169,NA
"This manuscript really reviews all the potential risk factors and brings you up to date on that, but really reveals the fact that we don't know a lot about the",98.169,7.754999999999999,105.92399999999999,NA
"atherosclerotic disease in
patients with type 1 diabetes. Another area is the plaque.
Is the plaque the same? Is it so lipid laden? And not only is HDL higher
in type 1 diabetic patients, but actually LDL
cholesterols are the same,",105.924,13.921000000000003,119.84500000000001,NA
"or lower. Triglycerides are almost never abnormal unless control is pitifully,
poorly controlled. I think we've got these issues
related to the plaque itself. Maybe the plaque is less lipid laden.",119.845,11.957999999999998,131.803,NA
"I think one hypothesis is the plaque is more calcified, more fibrotic, and may actually be more
stable in patients with type 1. Is the disease the same? Another area is the acute
coronary syndrome setting.",131.803,13.108,144.911,NA
"When the late George Eisenbarth and I did an editorial actually
in translational science before George left us,
unfortunately prematurely, we brought up the fact that
the acute coronary syndrome has never actually been
studied in type 1 patients.",144.911,14.782,159.693,NA
"Everything that links diabetes to cardiovascular disease is type 2. But, in fact, what the group at the Joslin has identified is that after a myocardial infarction on
a mass model in type 1,",159.693,10.84,170.53300000000002,NA
"there is a antibody mediated
myocarditis developed. But, when George and I wrote the editorial we couldn't find any evidence
the acute coronoary syndrome has actually been studied well in patients with type 1 diabetes.",170.533,12.283999999999999,182.81699999999998,NA
"In fact, is there an
antibody mediated myocarditis that results in a greater likelihood of congestive heart failure
and the acute coronary syndrome in patients with type 1?
We don't know. Finally, interventions in
type 1 just haven't ensued.",182.817,14.478,197.29500000000002,NA
What about statin trials in type 1? When did we start a type 1 child with type 1 diabetes on a statin? What about anti-hypertensive therapy and cardiovascular disease outcomes,197.295,10.437000000000001,207.732,NA
"in patients with type 1? I think what the manuscript does is really reveal these
absent areas of knowledge about type 1 diabetes and how it relates to coronary heart disease, and
peripheral vascular disease,",207.732,11.634,219.36599999999999,NA
"and stroke in patients
with type 1 diabetes. In fact, I think what
we've learned from this is that there's so many
unanswered questions that when I was at a meeting
at the NIDDK in the last year, ultimately I brought to
the attention to NIDDK",219.366,15.081,234.447,NA
"that this area really needs more science, and, in fact, what's
happened subsequent to that is that NHOBI and NIDDK are
sponsoring a joint symposium, a workshop, on coronary
disease and type 1 diabetes that's going to take place this October.",234.447,16.369999999999997,250.817,NA
"We're excited about the opportunity to bring scientists from around the world together on a topic that's
been poorly studied, and I think this manuscript in circulation really highlights the need for additional",250.817,12.121000000000002,262.938,NA
"science and medicine in
this particular area.",262.938,3.75,266.688,NA
