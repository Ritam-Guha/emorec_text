the bloodstream to rise excessively and because we only have 5 grams of glucose in the bloodstream and we eat a hundred grams at a sitting suddenly brothers hundred grams of,20.71,22.049,42.759,NA
carbohydrates which got to be stored in a blood system that can only take five grams and you have to ask the question if glucose is so essential to humans why do we only have five grams in the,31.539,25.650000000000002,57.18900000000001,NA

insulin an instant drives the glucose as I'll show you into the fat cells particularly including the fed cells in the liver and that then brings the glucose down so hyperinsulinemia is a,55.239,24.481,79.72,NA
state where the insulin is higher than it should be in response to the glucose challenge and one of the key differences in in people today the way we eat then we ate in the 1500s is in the 1500s we,67.96,29.58,97.53999999999999,NA

we eat every three hours and we told to eat every six we're told that eat six meals a day that means if it's carbohydrates we get this insulin response so every time we eat,97.48,18.75,116.23,NA
we've got this in Parkinson emic response and if you have insulin resistance like people with diabetes like myself the response is exaggerated so every time you eat you're damaging,106.9,20.13,127.03,NA
