across North America who are struggling with high blood pressure, as well as Europe, in
Australia and all around the world. And so again, I'm going to go through my top
five things you can do to lower blood pressure",6.95,23.66,30.61,angry
"naturally, and by the way, do this fast. Some of these plans people have out there
today can take months to see results. You can see results in one day, 24 hours,
by following the tips in this video. Your number one step to naturally lowering
your blood pressure is going to be consuming a Mediterranean-like diet.",30.61,20.049999999999997,50.66,angry
"And a Mediterranean diet is going to be very,
very high in fruits, vegetables, sea foods, and healthy omega-3 rich fat oils from things
like olives and flax seeds. And so, again, following a Mediterranean diet
and ideally would be considered more of a grain free or a lower grain consumption Mediterranean
diet is ideal. Some of the top foods you want to consume
on this diet are going to be olive oil, flax",50.66,28.028999999999996,78.689,angry
"seeds, wild-caught fish, especially salmon. And then, lots of fruits and vegetables. If you can do that, that is going to be step
one in naturally lowering your blood pressure. There are four more natural remedies that
are going to be beneficial as well. The number one supplement and my number two
thing you can do to naturally lower blood",78.689,19.831,98.52,sad

oil which is high in EPA and DHA forms of omega-3 fatty acids reduce inflammation of
the body. We know that one of the main causes of high
blood pressure is inflammation of the arteries overtime.",98.52,20.049,118.56899999999999,angry
"So again, take a high quality fish oil, a
1,000 milligrams every single day with your meals. The third natural remedy in naturally lowering
high blood pressure is going to be magnesium. Now, magnesium is great because this mineral
helps relax your blood vessels and it can have an immediate impact on naturally lowering
blood pressure.",118.569,20.78,139.349,angry

daily is a great dose to naturally start to lower blood pressure. The fourth natural remedy for lowering blood
pressure is going to be getting more potassium in your diet or taking even a potassium supplement. Potassium is essential and some of the best
potassium-rich foods includes coconut water",139.349,23.28,162.629,angry

a little bit sweet to drink through the day, you can do coconut water. Also doing a superfood smoothie in the morning,
doing coconut water as your actual liquid base but getting more potassium.",162.629,12.311,174.94,angry
"Avocados are also high in potassium, but what
I would do is go online and look up potassium-rich foods and start getting more potassium in
your diet to naturally lower blood pressure. And my number five supplement for naturally
lowering blood pressure is going to be Coenzyme Q10. CoQ10 is also crucial if you've ever been
on a blood pressure or especially a cholesterol",174.94,22.128999999999998,197.069,angry
"lowering medication, you must be taking Coenzyme
Q10. It's antioxidant that is critical for supporting
your heart health. And so typically 200 to 300 milligrams a day
of Coenzyme Q10 can absolutely naturally help balance blood pressure in the body. So remember, if you're going to lower your
