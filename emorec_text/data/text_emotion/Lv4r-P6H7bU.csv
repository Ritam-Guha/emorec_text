all right so our next topic is blood sugar and this is a really popular one with all the clients that i talk to because i feel like when i started,0.48,18.64,19.12,angry
in my practice 10 years ago when i would talk to people about their blood pressure they may or may not have known what it was and it was kind of like,10.0,16.56,26.56,angry
oh my friend over there has diabetes and now i feel like it's everybody knows somebody who's diabetic um you know it's all over the place so blood sugar is something that is really,17.76,23.119999999999997,40.879999999999995,angry
really concerning in most diets regardless of where you live how old you are um blood sugar is a big issue now we do think about blood sugar when,29.92,18.079,47.999,sad
it comes to diabetes and basically what happens is when you eat carbohydrates or sugar of any sort that goes through your digestive system,39.2,20.64,59.84,angry
pretty quickly and then once it hits your bloodstream it acts like no other nutrient does proteins fat they kind of take their time getting into your bloodstream,48.879,19.6,68.479,angry
but carbohydrates hit it immediately and you have that immediate rise in blood sugar then what happens is you get this signal sent to your pancreas and your pancreas releases insulin and,58.96,24.721000000000004,83.68100000000001,angry
insulin is a hormone so it's released it takes all that blood sugar swooshes it into your cells where your cells then use that blood sugar to do the things they need to do help,71.2,20.637999999999998,91.838,angry
give you energy help you focus when you're at work um all those things that we think of that carbohydrates actually do that are good for us,81.759,18.000999999999998,99.75999999999999,angry
however the problem is again we get too much there we have diets that are way too high in sugar way too high in refined carbs therefore our pancreas just kind of gets,90.159,27.921,118.08000000000001,sad
tired and it's not able to produce as much insulin as it needs it's not able to keep up and so what happens is that blood sugar is then stored as,104.56,17.84,122.4,happy
fat in the body and eventually your pancreas just starts not working as well as it should that's when somebody tends to go on insulin,114.24,16.799999999999997,131.04,sad
that's when um you get the diagnosis of diabetes so it's really important to know what your blood sugar levels are kind of where you're at,122.56,25.68,148.24,sad
and you know i know that there's a lot of people out there and you start to feel like well i can do this i can live with diabetes and you can but the goal would be to not go on,134.4,20.239,154.639,sad
medication with diabetes that you can actually control it with your diet and exercise which you're probably going to get really tired of hearing me say that you,144.879,14.641,159.51999999999998,sad
could deal with things with diet and exercise but it's true and you know of course there is the genetic factor and i'm going to talk about that next,152.72,17.36,170.07999999999998,angry
but when you look at it you really want to try to live a lifestyle that's going to allow you to not put all your money into maintaining your,160.72,16.559,177.279,angry
health and medication instead taking that money and putting in a place that is going to help you be healthier it's going to allow you to exercise you can,169.519,21.521,191.04000000000002,angry
get the access to exercise access to healthy foods supplements that you need all those things instead of putting all your money at the pharmacy so again blood sugar,179.44,20.719,200.159,angry
very important thing know your numbers when it comes to that and know that you can control it with diet and exercise,190.879,16.881,207.76,sad
