all right so our next topic is blood,0.48,3.52,4.0,sad
sugar,3.04,3.68,6.720000000000001,sad
and this is a really popular one with,4.0,4.639,8.639,fear
all the clients that i talk to because i,6.72,3.28,10.0,fear
feel like when i started,8.639,3.521,12.16,fear
in my practice 10 years ago when i would,10.0,3.36,13.36,fear
talk to people about their blood,12.16,2.0,14.16,fear
pressure,13.36,2.72,16.08,fear
they may or may not have known what it,14.16,3.6,17.76,fear
was and it was kind of like,16.08,4.88,20.959999999999997,fear
oh my friend over there has diabetes and,17.76,5.359,23.119,fear
now i feel like it's everybody knows,20.96,4.239,25.199,fear
somebody who's diabetic,23.119,5.121,28.240000000000002,fear
um you know it's all over the place so,25.199,4.721,29.92,fear
blood sugar is something that is really,28.24,3.68,31.919999999999998,fear
really concerning in most diets,29.92,3.76,33.68,fear
regardless of where you live,31.92,4.96,36.88,fear
how old you are um blood sugar is a big,33.68,3.84,37.519999999999996,fear
issue,36.88,2.32,39.2,fear
now we do think about blood sugar when,37.52,3.199,40.719,fear
it comes to diabetes,39.2,3.92,43.120000000000005,fear
and basically what happens is when you,40.719,3.68,44.399,fear
eat,43.12,4.32,47.44,fear
carbohydrates or sugar of any sort that,44.399,4.48,48.879000000000005,fear
goes through your digestive system,47.44,4.24,51.68,fear
pretty quickly and then once it hits,48.879,4.081,52.96,fear
your bloodstream,51.68,3.68,55.36,fear
it acts like no other nutrient does,52.96,4.0,56.96,fear
proteins fat they kind of take their,55.36,3.6,58.96,fear
time getting into your bloodstream,56.96,4.239,61.199,fear
but carbohydrates hit it immediately and,58.96,3.84,62.8,fear
you have that immediate rise,61.199,4.561,65.75999999999999,fear
in blood sugar then what happens is you,62.8,5.28,68.08,fear
get this signal sent to your pancreas,65.76,5.44,71.2,fear
and your pancreas releases insulin and,68.08,5.6,73.67999999999999,fear
insulin is a hormone so it's released it,71.2,4.559,75.759,fear
takes all that blood sugar swooshes it,73.68,4.799,78.47900000000001,fear
into your cells where your cells then,75.759,4.481,80.24,fear
use that blood sugar,78.479,3.28,81.759,fear
to do the things they need to do help,80.24,3.519,83.759,fear
give you energy help you focus when,81.759,3.04,84.799,fear
you're at work,83.759,3.281,87.04,fear
um all those things that we think of,84.799,4.161,88.96000000000001,fear
that carbohydrates actually do that are,87.04,3.119,90.159,fear
good for us,88.96,4.4,93.36,fear
however the problem is again,90.159,6.96,97.119,fear
we get too much there we have diets that,93.36,4.719,98.079,fear
are way too high,97.119,4.32,101.439,fear
in sugar way too high in refined carbs,98.079,6.481,104.55999999999999,fear
therefore our pancreas just kind of gets,101.439,5.441,106.88,fear
tired and it's not able to produce as,104.56,3.76,108.32000000000001,fear
much insulin as it needs,106.88,4.4,111.28,fear
it's not able to keep up and so what,108.32,3.52,111.83999999999999,fear
happens,111.28,2.96,114.24,fear
is that blood sugar is then stored as,111.84,3.2,115.04,fear
fat,114.24,3.28,117.52,fear
in the body and eventually your pancreas,115.04,3.439,118.47900000000001,fear
just starts,117.52,3.12,120.64,fear
not working as well as it should that's,118.479,4.081,122.56,fear
when somebody tends to go on insulin,120.64,2.88,123.52,fear
that's when,122.56,4.239,126.799,fear
um you get the diagnosis of diabetes,123.52,6.4,129.92,fear
so it's really important to know,126.799,6.001,132.8,fear
what your blood sugar levels are kind of,129.92,4.48,134.39999999999998,fear
where you're at,132.8,4.56,137.36,fear
and you know i know that there's a lot,134.4,4.0,138.4,fear
of people out there and you start to,137.36,2.72,140.08,fear
feel like well i can do this i can live,138.4,3.6,142.0,fear
with diabetes and you can,140.08,4.799,144.87900000000002,fear
but the goal would be to not go on,142.0,5.12,147.12,fear
medication with diabetes that you can,144.879,4.0,148.879,fear
actually control it with your diet and,147.12,2.56,149.68,fear
exercise,148.879,1.761,150.64,fear
which you're probably going to get,149.68,3.04,152.72,fear
really tired of hearing me say that you,150.64,3.28,153.92,fear
could deal with things with diet and,152.72,1.92,154.64,fear
exercise,153.92,3.679,157.599,fear
but it's true and you know of course,154.64,4.56,159.2,fear
there is the genetic factor and i'm,157.599,3.121,160.72,fear
going to talk about that next,159.2,4.08,163.28,fear
but when you look at it you really want,160.72,3.36,164.08,fear
to try,163.28,2.64,165.92,fear
to live a lifestyle that's going to,164.08,3.12,167.20000000000002,fear
allow you to not,165.92,3.599,169.51899999999998,fear
put all your money into maintaining your,167.2,3.84,171.04,fear
health and medication,169.519,3.681,173.20000000000002,fear
instead taking that money and putting in,171.04,3.919,174.959,fear
a place that is going to help,173.2,4.48,177.67999999999998,fear
you be healthier it's going to allow you,174.959,4.481,179.44,fear
to exercise you can,177.68,4.96,182.64000000000001,fear
get the access to exercise access to,179.44,5.6,185.04,fear
healthy foods supplements that you need,182.64,4.48,187.11999999999998,fear
all those things instead of putting all,185.04,3.199,188.239,fear
your money,187.12,3.759,190.879,fear
at the pharmacy so again blood sugar,188.239,3.681,191.92000000000002,fear
very important thing,190.879,3.201,194.07999999999998,fear
know your numbers when it comes to that,191.92,3.44,195.35999999999999,fear
and know that you can control it with,194.08,5.76,199.84,fear
diet and exercise,195.36,4.48,199.84,fear
