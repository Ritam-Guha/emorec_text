Literature Review.,63.0,1.18,64.18,NA
"There have been three major studies in the
literature over the past several years, fairly",64.18,5.579,69.759,NA
"large studies, but retrospective, totaling
about 11,000 patients. And together, they",69.759,5.431,75.19,NA
"seem to demonstrate that there's about a 1%
incidence of significant cerebral edema among",75.19,4.76,79.95,NA
"patients who present with DKA. Among those
who get significant cerebral edema, about",79.95,5.72,85.67,NA
40% will die or have a severe neurologic outcome.,85.67,2.949,88.619,NA
"If you do the math, that's a net population
mortality of about 0.4%. A more recent study",88.619,8.911,97.53,NA
"by a colleague of mine here at Children's,
Dr. DeCourcey, looked at a PHIS database review.",97.53,6.089,103.619,NA
"PHIS is an administrative database we have
access to in the US. Was able to look at a",103.619,5.661,109.28,NA
"total of just over 37,000 DKA patients in
a single study.",109.28,5.1,114.38,NA
"And to our surprise, we found a significant
increased incidence of significant cerebral",114.38,5.02,119.39999999999999,NA
"edema defined as edema that prompted therapy
of either Mannitol or hypertonic saline by",119.4,8.469,127.869,NA
"a practicing clinician. Fourfold increase
in the incidence, but a 10% mortality. So",127.869,9.611,137.48,NA
"a significantly reduced mortality. And on
the face, that looks like good news. We're",137.48,3.92,141.39999999999998,NA
"treating more patients and they're doing better.
But again, when one does the math, basically",141.4,4.66,146.06,NA
"we haven't changed the ultimate mortality
at all.",146.06,2.66,148.72,NA
"We're treating four times as many patients.
They're one quarter as likely to have a bad",148.72,6.28,155.0,NA

So despite our advances over the decades,",155.0,7.22,162.22,NA
"it's not clear that we've made a major impact
in overall mortality. But these numbers are",162.22,7.269,169.489,NA
"low, and it's easy to have had even a 30%
or 40% effect on mortality and have that really",169.489,6.81,176.299,NA

Risk Factors for Cerebral Edema.,179.959,2.201,182.16,NA
"Now, what are the known risk factors for cerebral
edema? Well, again back to Dr. Glaser's paper,",182.16,6.82,188.98,NA
"from 2001. Now, she identified four major
risk factors in children with significant",188.98,5.55,194.53,NA
"cerebral edema. Three of them are shown here.
A high BUN, a low PaCO2, and treatment with",194.53,8.769,203.299,NA
"bicarbonate. Now we know that a high BUN is
associated with someone who's dehydrated.",203.299,7.601,210.9,NA
"How about a low PaCO2? That's someone who
has a very low pH. And they're hyperventilating",210.9,5.489,216.389,NA
"and dropping their PaCO2 so that they can
blow off some of that additional acid. And",216.389,5.241,221.63,NA
"who gets treated with bicarbonate? Those who
the lowest pH.",221.63,4.68,226.31,NA
"So although these were independent risk factors,
the reality is that all three of them correlate,",226.31,5.95,232.26,NA
"really quite directly, with severity of illness.
And while they may be independent risk factors,",232.26,6.009,238.269,NA
"as clinicians, we look at patients and are
message is the more dehydrated, the more acidotic",238.269,6.701,244.97,NA
"they are, the more at risk they are. The fourth
risk factor was the one that really kind of",244.97,5.65,250.62,NA
"threw us for a loop. Fourth risk factor, if
you notice, demonstrates a lower relative",250.62,6.929,257.549,NA
"risk when the serum sodium rises by more than
5.8 per hour. The prior three risk factors",257.549,10.061,267.60999999999996,NA
"I showed you, if they were true, the relative
risk is increased.",267.61,4.13,271.74,NA
"In this case, when it's true the relative
risk decreases. What that suggests is that",271.74,4.489,276.229,NA
"a serum sodium rise of 5.8 per hour is a good
thing. Now, we measure serum sodium every",276.229,8.141,284.37,NA
"two hours. And that would mean that we would
have a change of 12, almost 12 millimoles",284.37,9.68,294.05,NA
"per liter, over a two hour period. And that means
patient comes in with serum sodium 125, you",294.05,5.649,299.699,NA
"check it again a couple hours later, it's
137. That is an extraordinary change. And",299.699,5.97,305.66900000000004,NA
"as a clinician, I would posit that this is
not, in my experience, a degree of change",305.669,6.87,312.539,NA
"in serum sodium that we see very commonly
at all. So what do we with this risk factor?",312.539,4.831,317.37,NA
"Does it only apply when the serum sodium rises
so dramatically to an extent that we almost",317.37,6.569,323.939,NA
never see?,323.939,1.051,324.99,neutral
"Instead, we can look at it from a little bit
of a different point of view. If you come",324.99,5.35,330.34000000000003,NA
"over here and look at this graph I'll show
you what I mean. So if we look at the evolution",330.34,8.289,338.62899999999996,NA
"of sodium and glucose concentrations over
time, in the setting of DKA, we can think",338.629,5.0,343.629,NA
"about it from a point of view of being above
and below normal. So if we consider this to",343.629,6.931,350.56,NA
"be a normal range, and we start with a glucose
concentration that is quite high, we know",350.56,14.12,364.68,NA
"from our discussion that the serum sodium
will be relatively low.",364.7,6.2,370.9,NA
"And the idea in resolution of DKA is that
as the glucose comes down into the normal",372.42,10.78,383.2,NA
"range, the serum sodium ought to rise. The
reason the serum sodium is low to begin with,",383.21,7.9,391.10999999999996,NA
"you will recall, is that glucose is an osmotic
agent that pulls water into the bloodstream,",391.11,6.279,397.389,NA
"deluding everything that's in the bloodstream.
So it's going to dilute sodium. It's going",397.389,4.101,401.49,NA
"to dilute potassium and chloride as well.
But sodium is the most obvious, the most prominent.",401.49,6.79,408.28000000000003,NA
"And as glucose comes out of the extremely
high range, into the normal range, the exact",408.28,6.59,414.86999999999995,NA
same thing ought to happen with sodium.,414.87,2.82,417.69,NA
"The risk factor that we were discussing earlier,
is when glucose begins to come down but sodium",424.689,9.051,433.74,NA
"does not come up at the same rate. If sodium
comes up a little bit and kind of flattens",433.74,8.109,441.849,NA
"out that is considered invocation of the risk
factor that sodium has not risen fast enough.",441.849,9.551,451.4,NA
"And this is considered a risk factor for developing
significant cerebral edema. One way to follow",451.4,12.049,463.44899999999996,NA
"the relationship between the hyperglycemia
and the hyponatremia, over time, is to look",463.449,5.761,469.21000000000004,NA
at the corrected serum sodium.,469.22,6.069,475.28900000000004,NA
"One way to think about the sodium changes
that we talked about are to look at a value",475.3,5.679,480.979,NA
"that we refer to as the corrected sodium.
Corrected sodium answers the question, what",480.979,5.321,486.3,NA
"would the serum sodium be if glucose was normal?
We use a formula to calculate this. And we",486.3,8.049,494.349,NA
"say, we take the serum sodium, and look at
the serum glucose, and we say, see how many",494.349,6.22,500.569,NA
"100s over 100 is the serum glucose. And multiply
that times 2 and add it to the serum sodium.",500.569,5.981,506.55,NA
"And we get our corrected sodium. For example,
serum sodium is 125 and the blood sugar is",506.55,5.96,512.51,NA
"900. Well, that's 800 over 100. So 8 times
2 is 16. We add 16 to the 125, we get 141.",512.51,11.279,523.789,NA
"So the corrected sodium in this example is
141, while the measured sodium is 125.",523.789,7.281,531.0699999999999,NA
"A question that's often asked in the situation
is, which is a real? Which is the real serum",531.07,5.31,536.38,NA
"sodium? The answer is, very definitively,
that the serum sodium is 125. The sodium that",536.38,7.34,543.72,NA
"the brain is seeing, it's 125. What would
the sodium be if the glucose was normal? 141.",543.72,7.52,551.24,NA
"But the glucose isn't normal. The glucose
is 900. And so, right now, the serum sodium",551.24,5.89,557.13,NA
"is quite low. The way we use the measured,
the way we use the corrected sodium to think",557.13,7.98,565.11,NA
"about this risk factor is to say, the corrected
sodium should be normal and stay normal.",565.11,7.37,572.48,NA
"If, as we saw on the graph, the glucose comes
down and the serum sodium does not rise adequately,",572.48,9.81,582.29,NA
"that should be reflected in a corrected sodium
that is low. So if there were corrected sodium",582.29,4.78,587.0699999999999,NA
"drops below 137, 138, we really need to get
ourselves to the bedside, do a thorough neurological",587.07,8.15,595.22,NA
"exam, and determine whether or not this patient
has symptoms of significant cerebral edema.",595.22,5.95,601.1700000000001,NA
"And think about treating at that point. But
this risk factor is really only present when",601.17,7.69,608.86,NA
this the sodium does not rise sufficiently.,608.86,2.52,611.38,sad
"Now you may ask, why would I not just give
sodium? Well, there's nothing, I don't have",611.38,9.269,620.649,NA
"any data to suggest that one should not treat
this scenario with sodium. But I will tell",620.649,6.721,627.37,NA
"you that every study that has ever looked
at rate of sodium administration has not found",627.37,4.49,631.86,NA
"it to be a predictor of significant cerebral
edema. We are physicians, and when something",631.86,8.43,640.29,NA
"is low, and it's a bad sign, then our inclination
is to treat it, to bring it up. The best example,",640.29,9.82,650.11,NA
"the best analogy I could think of is a patient
with meningitis.",650.11,4.229,654.339,NA

meningitis and has a CSF white count to 10,000.",654.339,6.42,660.759,NA

is a very poor prognosticator and significant",660.759,7.311,668.07,NA

can either treat this patient with ceftriaxone",668.07,4.37,672.44,NA

you going to choose? You're going to choose",672.44,7.11,679.5500000000001,NA

the problem here is that there are bacteria",679.55,5.399,684.949,NA

a massive amount of inflammation that is putting",684.949,5.0,689.949,NA

The white cells are only a symptom of the",689.949,5.541,695.49,NA
underlying pathology.,695.49,1.67,697.16,NA
"I would posit to you that is really the exact
same thing that's going on here. When the",697.16,4.619,701.779,NA
"sodium fails to rise normally it is not the
problem. It is a symptom of the problem. And",701.779,6.131,707.91,NA
"it is very likely connected to inappropriate
ADH secretion that is triggered by an injured",707.91,9.25,717.16,NA
"brain. And a brain that is becoming more and
more, either ischemic or significant swelling",717.16,8.239,725.399,NA
"with a significant pressure building up, triggering
release of ADH, an inability to allow the",725.399,7.831,733.23,NA
"kidney to clear adequate free water. That
doesn't get any closer to a treatment approach,",733.23,7.07,740.3000000000001,NA
"but it does point out that the failure of
sodium to rise has not been shown to be a",740.3,6.81,747.1099999999999,NA
"component of the pathology, rather a symptom
or a sign of the pathology. Having said all",747.11,7.649,754.759,NA
"that, when we see serum sodium fail to rise
or a corrected sodium that begins to drop,",754.759,7.211,761.97,NA
"the right approach, because we don't have
any better data, is to increase the concentration",761.97,5.19,767.1600000000001,NA

delivering. And we'll talk about that more",767.16,4.679,771.8389999999999,NA

significant. You see those on the screen.",780.529,6.331,786.86,NA

It's very helpful for clinicians, over the",786.86,6.39,793.25,NA
"years, to understand that a glucose of 1,200
is no more risky than a glucose of 600. What",793.25,5.99,799.24,NA

of dehydration, the factors that we talked",799.24,4.74,803.98,NA

an insulin bolus didn't attribute increased",803.98,7.539,811.519,NA

for example, was not shown to be a significant",824.72,5.669,830.389,NA

that if we give a massive amount of fluid",830.389,4.661,835.05,NA
