hi guys I doing a roleplay yesterday,0.24,3.03,3.2699999999999996,sad
with someone and they were thinking,1.86,3.03,4.89,sad
about starting metformin as part of,3.27,3.54,6.8100000000000005,sad
someone's type 2 diabetes management so,4.89,3.029,7.919,sad
I thought a really quick video on the,6.81,3.78,10.59,sad
dosing as per BNF that you'd be,7.919,4.321,12.239999999999998,sad
suggesting when you start metformin and,10.59,3.209,13.799,sad
also some of the side effects that you,12.24,3.569,15.809000000000001,surprise
may be counseling a patient for in a,13.799,3.781,17.58,sad
medical exam roleplay or if you get it,15.809,4.05,19.858999999999998,sad
in a medical exam question so metformin,17.58,4.59,22.169999999999998,sad
for an adults generally started the dose,19.859,5.191,25.05,sad
of 500 milligrams once a day for a week,22.17,4.439,26.609,sad
and you advise that you take that at,25.05,3.569,28.619,sad
breakfast time then you move on to the,26.609,4.861,31.470000000000002,sad
second week 500 milligrams BD for the,28.619,5.19,33.809,sad
second week doses at breakfast and with,31.47,4.65,36.12,sad
your evening meal and then thirdly you,33.809,5.611,39.419999999999995,sad
go into 500 milligrams TDS one dose of,36.12,4.92,41.04,sad
breakfast wanders at lunch and then one,39.42,3.0,42.42,sad
dose with your evening meal II remember,41.04,3.089,44.129,sad
the maximum dose asked for the B and F,42.42,5.61,48.03,sad
is 2 grams in a day but in divided doses,44.129,7.351,51.48,sad
so that's the general starting regime,48.03,4.95,52.980000000000004,sad
but of course people with renal function,51.48,2.7,54.18,sad
for example this is different you may be,52.98,2.94,55.919999999999995,sad
altering that with another video on,54.18,3.6,57.78,sad
renal function or metformin but that's,55.92,3.63,59.550000000000004,sad
your general adult dose what about,57.78,3.119,60.899,sad
counseling for side effects generally is,59.55,3.27,62.82,sad
GI stuff really so think about the low,60.899,3.781,64.68,sad
source of GI problems nausea vomiting,62.82,4.35,67.17,sad
loose stool abdominal pain reduced,64.68,3.84,68.52000000000001,sad
appetite also things like taste,67.17,2.91,70.08,sad
disturbance can commonly happen since,68.52,2.88,71.39999999999999,sad
was counseling about these things of,70.08,3.149,73.229,sad
course there are some rarer things like,71.4,4.77,76.17,sad
hepatitis lactic acidosis generally,73.229,4.53,77.759,sad
those are very rare but GI things are,76.17,4.08,80.25,sad
pretty common especially early on with,77.759,4.351,82.11,sad
metformin so have a look at the BLF an,80.25,4.77,85.02,sad
IC KS for more information dosing and,82.11,4.77,86.88,sad
side effects of metformin much more,85.02,3.87,88.89,sad
