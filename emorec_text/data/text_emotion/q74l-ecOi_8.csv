your blood sugar doesn't have all that much to do with keto okay if you see your blood sugar rising it doesn't necessarily mean that you're not in keto and it doesn't necessarily have that,0.06,21.3,21.36,sad
much of a negative effect on your ketogenic lifestyle I see a lot of people that measure their success on keto or measure whether a food is good or bad purely based upon what their,10.95,19.17,30.12,sad
blood sugar level is I got to break this down because quite honestly it's way different than what you might think hey you're watching the Internet's leading performance nutrition channel new videos,20.01,18.27,38.28,sad
coming out every single Tuesday Friday and Sunday at 7 a.m. Pacific time I also want to make sure you head on over to highlight com2 check out the pinion performance apparel I'm always wearing,29.64,17.25,46.89,NA
in my videos all right so what it comes down to is two different things one is called physiological insulin resistance okay physiologic insulin resistance is what,38.01,17.969,55.979,NA
we actually want and I'll explain it in a second pathological insulin resistance is like what you get when you're diabetic for example you see basically in short what's going on is your body is,47.19,20.759999999999998,67.94999999999999,NA
starting to refuse the acceptance of glucose your cells are no longer accepting as much glucose all right so let's put this into context you've been consuming carbs for most of your life so,57.149,20.491,77.64,sad
your cells your muscles are all used to using carbs then all of a sudden you start keto so your body becomes fat adapted it becomes used to using fats so therefore those cells refuse the,67.74,23.76,91.5,sad
acceptance of carbs well guess what even though your body is refusing to use the carbs it's still producing glucose we always produce glucose we need glucose within the body this means that,79.29,26.13,105.42,NA
no matter what the body's finding a way to create carbs it's creating glucose from your protein it's creating glucose from your lactate it's creating glucose from all kinds of different processes to,92.49,21.058999999999997,113.54899999999999,NA
function the specific cells that still need glucose okay so when you're in keto the liver produces ketones those ketones fuel the brain then the muscles are fueled by free fatty acids where does,102.99,22.529999999999998,125.52,NA
this leave glucose this leaves glucose in the equation for the small amount of cells within the body that require glucose that can't function on anything else so this means that you still have a,114.329,19.29,133.619,NA
physiological requirement for glucose but most of your cells are denying access with the glucose this means that your blood sugar is going to be elevated if you're in Quito,124.049,18.511,142.56,NA
generally speaking so you might find that your blood glucose goes up when you're in keto although it probably remains somewhat stable okay and you might also notice that your blood sugar,133.41,16.59,150.0,NA
is higher in the morning okay this has to do with what's called the dawn phenomenon the dawn phenomenon is where early in the morning your body produces a bunch of cortisol a bunch of,141.6,17.52,159.12,NA
epinephrine a bunch of norepinephrine to get you amped up and get you awake well those catecholamines like epinephrine and adrenaline they release glucose into the blood that's part of,150.27,20.67,170.94,NA
their whole process so no matter what whether you're keto or not they're still releasing glucose into the blood but you just released glucose into the blood and that glucose doesn't have a whole lot of,160.59,19.44,180.03,NA
places to go because a vast majority of your cells are refusing it so therefore it stays in your bloodstream and elevates your blood glucose then you go and you eat some protein and that,170.16,21.929999999999996,192.09,NA
protein gets converted into glucose so your glucose goes even higher so you start blaming your higher blood sugar on all these different foods you're looking at Oh what did I eat I ate this and it,180.69,19.08,199.76999999999998,NA
made my blood sugar high it's kicking me out of quito that's not the case this is just the way the body works so your blood glucose might go higher it doesn't mean that your ketone production has,191.04,17.22,208.26,NA
stopped so I don't want you to freak out what you do want to be focusing on is making sure that your blood sugar levels are nice and stable you don't want big spikes you don't want big Falls you just,199.47,17.46,216.93,NA
want to keep it nice and consistent so that insulin levels are low where they should be and blood glucose levels are nice and even where there should be as always make sure you're keeping it,208.41,15.719999999999999,224.13,NA
locked in here my channel you have ideas for future videos make sure you put them in the comment section see you in the next video,216.3,11.89,228.19,NA
