your blood sugar doesn't have all that,0.06,4.35,4.409999999999999,sad
much to do with keto okay if you see,1.89,4.83,6.72,sad
your blood sugar rising it doesn't,4.41,4.89,9.3,fear
necessarily mean that you're not in keto,6.72,4.23,10.95,fear
and it doesn't necessarily have that,9.3,3.0,12.3,happy
much of a negative effect on your,10.95,3.269,14.219,NA
ketogenic lifestyle I see a lot of,12.3,3.36,15.66,NA
people that measure their success on,14.219,3.541,17.759999999999998,NA
keto or measure whether a food is good,15.66,4.35,20.009999999999998,NA
or bad purely based upon what their,17.76,4.65,22.410000000000004,happy
blood sugar level is I got to break this,20.01,4.259,24.269000000000002,sad
down because quite honestly it's way,22.41,3.9,26.31,sad
different than what you might think hey,24.269,3.6,27.869,sad
you're watching the Internet's leading,26.31,3.33,29.64,NA
performance nutrition channel new videos,27.869,3.181,31.05,NA
coming out every single Tuesday Friday,29.64,4.02,33.66,NA
and Sunday at 7 a.m. Pacific time I also,31.05,3.75,34.8,fear
want to make sure you head on over to,33.66,3.0,36.66,fear
highlight com2 check out the pinion,34.8,3.21,38.01,fear
performance apparel I'm always wearing,36.66,3.27,39.93,NA
in my videos all right so what it comes,38.01,3.959,41.969,NA
down to is two different things one is,39.93,4.77,44.7,NA
called physiological insulin resistance,41.969,3.211,45.18,NA
okay,44.7,2.49,47.190000000000005,fear
physiologic insulin resistance is what,45.18,3.539,48.719,NA
we actually want and I'll explain it in,47.19,4.349,51.539,NA
a second pathological insulin resistance,48.719,4.02,52.739000000000004,NA
is like what you get when you're,51.539,3.241,54.78,NA
diabetic for example you see basically,52.739,4.41,57.149,NA
in short what's going on is your body is,54.78,4.74,59.52,NA
starting to refuse the acceptance of,57.149,4.531,61.68,NA
glucose your cells are no longer,59.52,4.469,63.989000000000004,surprise
accepting as much glucose all right so,61.68,4.259,65.939,fear
let's put this into context you've been,63.989,3.751,67.74,fear
consuming carbs for most of your life so,65.939,3.481,69.41999999999999,sad
your cells your muscles are all used to,67.74,3.12,70.86,fear
using carbs then all of a sudden you,69.42,3.69,73.11,NA
start keto so your body becomes fat,70.86,5.31,76.17,NA
adapted it becomes used to using fats so,73.11,6.18,79.28999999999999,fear
therefore those cells refuse the,76.17,5.46,81.63,happy
acceptance of carbs well guess what,79.29,5.369,84.659,happy
even though your body is refusing to use,81.63,5.58,87.21,NA
the carbs it's still producing glucose,84.659,6.0,90.659,NA
we always produce glucose we need,87.21,5.28,92.49,NA
glucose within the body this means that,90.659,3.901,94.56,NA
no matter what the body's finding a way,92.49,4.5,96.99,fear
to create carbs it's creating glucose,94.56,4.349,98.909,surprise
from your protein it's creating glucose,96.99,3.75,100.74,surprise
from your lactate it's creating glucose,98.909,4.081,102.99000000000001,happy
from all kinds of different processes to,100.74,4.379,105.119,NA
function the specific cells that still,102.99,4.019,107.009,NA
need glucose okay so when you're in keto,105.119,4.53,109.649,NA
the liver produces ketones those ketones,107.009,4.921,111.93,NA
fuel the brain then the muscles are,109.649,4.68,114.32900000000001,fear
fueled by free fatty acids where does,111.93,4.38,116.31,fear
this leave glucose this leaves glucose,114.329,3.661,117.99,fear
in the equation for the small amount of,116.31,3.69,120.0,NA
cells within the body that require,117.99,3.96,121.94999999999999,NA
glucose that can't function on anything,120.0,4.049,124.049,NA
else so this means that you still have a,121.95,3.93,125.88000000000001,NA
physiological requirement for glucose,124.049,4.531,128.58,NA
but most of your cells are denying,125.88,4.98,130.85999999999999,fear
access with the glucose this means that,128.58,3.72,132.3,fear
your blood sugar is going to be elevated,130.86,2.55,133.41000000000003,fear
if you're in Quito,132.3,2.73,135.03,fear
generally speaking so you might find,133.41,2.94,136.35,fear
that your blood glucose goes up when,135.03,3.15,138.18,fear
you're in keto although it probably,136.35,3.93,140.28,NA
remains somewhat stable okay and you,138.18,3.42,141.6,NA
might also notice that your blood sugar,140.28,3.15,143.43,NA
is higher in the morning okay this has,141.6,3.18,144.78,NA
to do with what's called the dawn,143.43,3.75,147.18,NA
phenomenon the dawn phenomenon is where,144.78,3.93,148.71,NA
early in the morning your body produces,147.18,3.09,150.27,sad
a bunch of cortisol a bunch of,148.71,3.57,152.28,sad
epinephrine a bunch of norepinephrine to,150.27,3.6,153.87,sad
get you amped up and get you awake,152.28,3.42,155.7,sad
well those catecholamines like,153.87,4.41,158.28,fear
epinephrine and adrenaline they release,155.7,4.89,160.58999999999997,fear
glucose into the blood that's part of,158.28,4.35,162.63,sad
their whole process so no matter what,160.59,3.6,164.19,NA
whether you're keto or not they're still,162.63,3.81,166.44,NA
releasing glucose into the blood but you,164.19,3.99,168.18,NA
just released glucose into the blood and,166.44,3.72,170.16,NA
that glucose doesn't have a whole lot of,168.18,4.32,172.5,NA
places to go because a vast majority of,170.16,5.43,175.59,NA
your cells are refusing it so therefore,172.5,4.47,176.97,NA
it stays in your bloodstream and,175.59,3.84,179.43,NA
elevates your blood glucose then you go,176.97,3.72,180.69,neutral
and you eat some protein and that,179.43,4.47,183.9,NA
protein gets converted into glucose so,180.69,5.28,185.97,NA
your glucose goes even higher so you,183.9,3.96,187.86,NA
start blaming your higher blood sugar on,185.97,3.51,189.48,NA
all these different foods you're looking,187.86,3.18,191.04000000000002,NA
at Oh what did I eat I ate this and it,189.48,3.15,192.63,NA
made my blood sugar high it's kicking me,191.04,3.0,194.04,NA
out of quito that's not the case this is,192.63,3.27,195.9,NA
just the way the body works so your,194.04,3.9,197.94,NA
blood glucose might go higher it doesn't,195.9,3.57,199.47,NA
mean that your ketone production has,197.94,3.48,201.42,NA
stopped so I don't want you to freak out,199.47,3.51,202.98,NA
what you do want to be focusing on is,201.42,3.18,204.6,NA
making sure that your blood sugar levels,202.98,3.45,206.42999999999998,NA
are nice and stable you don't want big,204.6,3.81,208.41,NA
spikes you don't want big Falls you just,206.43,3.51,209.94,NA
want to keep it nice and consistent so,208.41,3.42,211.82999999999998,NA
that insulin levels are low where they,209.94,3.84,213.78,NA
should be and blood glucose levels are,211.83,3.39,215.22,NA
nice and even where there should be as,213.78,2.52,216.3,NA
always make sure you're keeping it,215.22,2.55,217.77,NA
locked in here my channel you have ideas,216.3,2.97,219.27,NA
for future videos make sure you put them,217.77,2.85,220.62,NA
in the comment section see you in the,219.27,3.71,222.98000000000002,NA
