when patients have very uncontrolled,5.569,4.181,9.75,
high blood pressure for a long period of,8.22,5.1,13.32,neutral
time our organs feel that pressure and,9.75,6.869,16.619,neutral
over the course of time when our organs,13.32,5.28,18.6,neutral
are continuously hit with high blood,16.619,4.801,21.42,neutral
pressures they start by browsing they,18.6,5.04,23.64,neutral
started getting thickened and they,21.42,4.29,25.71,neutral
stopped working properly one of the,23.64,3.66,27.3,neutral
issues that can occur is something,25.71,4.319,30.029,neutral
called end-stage renal disease we watch,27.3,5.13,32.43,neutral
patients a kidney function over the,30.029,5.341,35.37,neutral
course of time and the kidney function,32.43,5.879,38.309,neutral
starts to decline and so we try to use,35.37,4.29,39.66,neutral
certain medications to help prevent,38.309,3.871,42.18,neutral
progression of the but high blood,39.66,4.91,44.56999999999999,neutral
pressure and and and organ damage,42.18,5.67,47.85,neutral
however sometimes patients develop what,44.57,5.559,50.129,neutral
we call end-stage renal disease which,47.85,3.9,51.75,neutral
usually requires patients to be on,50.129,4.02,54.149,neutral
dialysis and that again these are things,51.75,3.8,55.55,neutral
that we're trying to avoid,54.149,7.071,61.22,neutral
