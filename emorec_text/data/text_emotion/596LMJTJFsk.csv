"A fourth group of medication is one that we call 
Thiazolidinediones  we just use the word TZD for short in order to 
pronounce it easier.  There are two agents made in this fashion they 
are called Avandia or Rosiglitazone  and Actos or pioglitazone.  These agents are a little bit different than 
anything else in that they work in the body to

muscle cells in the fat cells of your body and enable them to use insulin better  and therefore reduce your blood sugar very 
effectively Avandia comes as a 2,4 or 8 mg tablet  and is taken once a day or sometimes twice a 
day. Actos comes as a 15, 30 or 45 mg tablet and is 
also taken once a day.",37.0,34.033,71.033,angry
"The big thing about these two agents is that they 
don't cause and excessively low blood sugar  and therefore we don't really need to test their 
blood sugars often when we take that medicine 
in order to identify hypoglycemia because it won't happen  however these agents do have some adverse 
effects because some fluid retention and 
therefore if you have heart failure  you should not take these medications ",71.033,31.967,103.0,angry
"there was a question whether there was an 
increased incidence of heart attack actually  with Avandia but in recent studies that is not been 
shown to be the case even though there was an 
increased  incidences of heart attack in patients who had 
fluid retention and heart failure. There is one other side effect of these drugs 
which is out of some importance of his recently 
been shown that   they cause a weakening of the bones or 
osteoporosis ",103.0,28.066000000000003,131.066,angry

it's the bones of the feet, the hands, and the 
lower arms  not the spine and the hips the usual source of 
most osteoporosis fractures so if you had a 
person who has osteoporosis they probably shouldn't take these agents  Finally I should mention these agents come 
combined with metformin and with a sulfonylurea called 
Amarillo and therefore",131.066,35.0,166.066,NA
"Avandia is available as an Avandamet  and Avandamet is a drug combining 500 mg of 
metformin with 2 4 or 8 mg of Avandia  the amount of metformin in those ages could be 
there are 500 or 1000 mg pill so you can end up 
taking  one pill twice a day and have a very significant 
blood sugar lowering",166.066,35.0,201.066,angry

high A1c  that is high blood sugars and you need more 
than one drug to get them down to their goal levels that's when you would 
consider a combined agent.

"Avandaryl comes as a 4 mg of Avandia  with 1 to 2 mg of Amaryl, or 4 mg of Avandia with 4 mg of Amaryl. This combined agent taken twice a day very 
effectively reduces blood sugar but in this case 
can cause hypoglycemia because the sulfonylurea Amaryl does produce 
hypoglycemia ",229.066,35.0,264.06600000000003,angry
