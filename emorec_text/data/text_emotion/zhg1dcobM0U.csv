[Music],0.96,3.69,4.65,sad
so in terms of specific,5.04,5.519,10.559000000000001,sad
symptoms other than the deformities that,6.799,6.081,12.88,sad
acromegaly,10.559,6.401,16.96,sad
causes we look at sweating,12.88,7.12,20.0,sad
there shouldn't be a reason for someone,16.96,3.44,20.400000000000002,sad
to,20.0,3.279,23.279,sad
start sweating more than usual when,20.4,4.639,25.038999999999998,sad
there are middle-aged,23.279,5.281,28.56,sad
or elderly adults,25.039,6.881,31.92,sad
we also like to um,28.56,6.48,35.04,sad
think of um,31.92,5.68,37.6,sad
physical signs for example we shake the,35.04,3.6,38.64,sad
patient's hand,37.6,3.119,40.719,sad
when we uh when we see them in the,38.64,3.2,41.84,sad
office,40.719,4.961,45.68,sad
so you can feel that the pad that is,41.84,6.32,48.160000000000004,sad
actually thicker in patients with,45.68,4.879,50.559,sad
acromegaly compared to patients who,48.16,6.48,54.64,sad
don't have acromegaly we like to look at,50.559,5.441,56.0,sad
old pictures,54.64,4.079,58.719,sad
because especially for patients that we,56.0,4.719,60.719,sad
see for the first time,58.719,4.801,63.52,sad
it it might not be easy to tell what,60.719,3.52,64.239,sad
kind of,63.52,4.24,67.76,sad
changes occurred,64.239,6.961,71.2,sad
so those would be the main,67.76,7.92,75.68,sad
things that that are specific,71.2,8.32,79.52000000000001,sad
besides what we see in terms of clear,75.68,5.68,81.36000000000001,sad
deformities,79.52,5.04,84.56,sad
when you asked me about other,81.36,5.759,87.119,sad
physicians or practitioners involved in,84.56,3.68,88.24000000000001,sad
the patient's care,87.119,3.521,90.64,sad
we actually looked at this with with our,88.24,4.72,92.96,sad
study at emory where,90.64,5.519,96.159,sad
where do patients come from which,92.96,4.479,97.439,sad
physicians refer,96.159,4.721,100.88000000000001,fear
them before the endocrinologist gets,97.439,4.561,102.0,sad
involved,100.88,4.879,105.759,sad
who is involved and the one interesting,102.0,7.52,109.52,sad
um observation is that for women,105.759,6.72,112.479,sad
especially those who are young still in,109.52,3.68,113.2,sad
their,112.479,4.28,116.759,fear
fertility years for women,113.2,6.959,120.159,sad
gynecologists play an important role,116.759,5.801,122.56,sad
or primary care physicians if that's,120.159,3.6,123.759,sad
who's doing the,122.56,6.319,128.879,sad
usual women's health checkups,123.759,8.401,132.16,sad
what acromegaly causes in young women,128.879,6.401,135.28,fear
is irregular periods sometimes,132.16,4.719,136.879,fear
they go away completely so it's,135.28,3.12,138.4,sad
amenorrhea,136.879,4.161,141.04,sad
and sometimes even though the periods,138.4,3.76,142.16,sad
stay,141.04,5.919,146.959,sad
normal the problem is infertility,142.16,7.439,149.599,sad
and while this tends to happen in both,146.959,3.201,150.16,sad
women,149.599,3.841,153.44,sad
and men the infertility i think,150.16,5.359,155.519,sad
women are more likely to to seek,153.44,3.84,157.28,sad
attention for this,155.519,3.841,159.36,sad
from from a gynecologist or a,157.28,4.48,161.76,sad
reproductive endocrinologist so we've,159.36,3.12,162.48000000000002,sad
had,161.76,3.68,165.44,sad
quite a few referrals from from these,162.48,3.52,166.0,sad
women,165.44,3.92,169.35999999999999,sad
who were actually seeking,166.0,6.4,172.4,sad
medical attention for years before,169.36,7.519,176.87900000000002,sad
and they were diagnosed with polycystic,172.4,7.44,179.84,sad
ovarian syndrome pcos,176.879,6.321,183.2,sad
now pcos is a lot more common in general,179.84,4.319,184.159,sad
population,183.2,4.08,187.28,sad
than acromegaly is,184.159,6.241,190.39999999999998,sad
and pcos has a wide,187.28,4.8,192.08,sad
is more like a syndrome there are,190.4,3.919,194.31900000000002,sad
several criterias that could put one in,192.08,4.56,196.64000000000001,sad
the pcos category and,194.319,5.441,199.76,sad
many of those are clinical criteria,196.64,7.519,204.159,sad
so one could easily miss acromegaly,199.76,7.039,206.79899999999998,sad
in a in a patient who's otherwise been,204.159,4.0,208.159,sad
told that they have,206.799,4.881,211.68,sad
pcos so that's where i would,208.159,6.64,214.79899999999998,sad
like to emphasize early differential,211.68,5.199,216.87900000000002,sad
diagnosis,214.799,5.321,220.12,fear
in um in women with,216.879,7.121,224.0,happy
oligomenorrhea menorrhoear infertility,220.12,7.0,227.12,NA
the dentists definitely um also play a,224.0,3.599,227.599,NA
role,227.12,3.759,230.879,NA
because why would the teeth become more,227.599,4.321,231.92,NA
apart,230.879,4.56,235.439,NA
or or shift there are situations when,231.92,6.64,238.55999999999997,NA
when this is expected with the dental,235.439,4.08,239.519,NA
work and,238.56,4.64,243.2,NA
removal of teeth but many times,239.519,5.841,245.36,NA
i think if that's accompanied by,243.2,3.44,246.64,NA
prognosis or,245.36,4.879,250.239,NA
the lower jaw moving forward that should,246.64,6.799,253.439,NA
raise an alarm sign for,250.239,6.801,257.04,NA
something medical going on maybe a tumor,253.439,12.961,266.4,NA
that ex that secretes too much growth,257.04,9.36,266.40000000000003,NA
