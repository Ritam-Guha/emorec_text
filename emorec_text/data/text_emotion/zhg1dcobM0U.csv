[Music] so in terms of specific symptoms other than the deformities that acromegaly causes we look at sweating,0.96,28.811,29.771,angry
there shouldn't be a reason for someone to start sweating more than usual when there are middle-aged or elderly adults,16.96,23.52,40.480000000000004,angry
we also like to um think of um physical signs for example we shake the patient's hand when we uh when we see them in the,28.56,22.079,50.638999999999996,angry
office so you can feel that the pad that is actually thicker in patients with acromegaly compared to patients who don't have acromegaly we like to look at,40.719,28.081,68.8,angry
old pictures because especially for patients that we see for the first time it it might not be easy to tell what kind of,54.64,21.359,75.999,neutral
changes occurred so those would be the main things that that are specific besides what we see in terms of clear deformities,64.239,33.921,98.16,angry
when you asked me about other physicians or practitioners involved in the patient's care we actually looked at this with with our study at emory where,81.36,23.198999999999998,104.559,angry
where do patients come from which physicians refer them before the endocrinologist gets involved who is involved and the one interesting,92.96,26.16,119.11999999999999,neutral
um observation is that for women especially those who are young still in their fertility years for women gynecologists play an important role,105.759,27.439999999999998,133.199,neutral
or primary care physicians if that's who's doing the usual women's health checkups what acromegaly causes in young women is irregular periods sometimes,120.159,29.44,149.59900000000002,angry
they go away completely so it's amenorrhea and sometimes even though the periods stay normal the problem is infertility,135.28,24.399,159.679,angry
and while this tends to happen in both women and men the infertility i think women are more likely to to seek attention for this,146.959,20.082,167.041,angry
from from a gynecologist or a reproductive endocrinologist so we've had quite a few referrals from from these women,157.28,18.72,176.0,neutral
who were actually seeking medical attention for years before and they were diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome pcos now pcos is a lot more common in general,166.0,31.999,197.999,neutral
population than acromegaly is and pcos has a wide is more like a syndrome there are several criterias that could put one in,183.2,23.599999999999998,206.79999999999998,neutral
the pcos category and many of those are clinical criteria so one could easily miss acromegaly in a in a patient who's otherwise been told that they have,194.319,28.880000000000003,223.19899999999998,neutral
pcos so that's where i would like to emphasize early differential diagnosis in um in women with oligomenorrhea menorrhoear infertility,208.159,31.281,239.44,NA
the dentists definitely um also play a role because why would the teeth become more apart or or shift there are situations when,224.0,22.879,246.879,NA
when this is expected with the dental work and removal of teeth but many times i think if that's accompanied by prognosis or,235.439,22.880000000000003,258.319,NA
the lower jaw moving forward that should raise an alarm sign for something medical going on maybe a tumor that ex that secretes too much growth,246.64,35.921,282.561,NA
