lag time between the onset of symptoms,21.119,4.48,25.599,NA
and typically the diagnosis,23.519,4.481,28.0,NA
several years typically and that's,25.599,3.6,29.199,NA
because,28.0,3.279,31.279,NA
the symptoms are insidious and because,29.199,5.04,34.239000000000004,NA

so,69.6,3.36,72.96,NA
um if somebody is diagnosed with this,70.159,4.401,74.56,NA

you know there should be collaboration,80.0,4.0,84.0,NA
among different specialists,82.159,5.201,87.36,NA
um because uh once uh let's say somebody,84.0,4.88,88.88,NA
has a diabetes,87.36,4.56,91.92,NA
and he's on insulin uh once the,88.88,4.8,93.67999999999999,NA
acromegaly is controlled,91.92,3.36,95.28,NA
well they most likely are gonna need,93.68,3.439,97.119,NA
less insulin or may not,95.28,3.44,98.72,NA
need insulin at all or their blood,97.119,3.281,100.4,NA
pressure medication needs to be,98.72,3.84,102.56,NA

medication is no longer needed it needs,109.92,2.72,112.64,NA
