Hey guys.,1.78,1.0,2.7800000000000002,neutral
Dr. Berg here.,2.78,1.0,3.78,sad
"In this short video, we're going to talk about
hypoglycemia.",3.78,1.56,5.34,sad
What is that?,5.34,1.0,6.34,sad
That's a low blood sugar situation.,6.34,2.67,9.01,sad
The symptoms are irritableness.,9.01,3.09,12.1,sad
"Sometimes you get bloodshot eyes or irritable
or sand in the eyes that feels like it's an",12.1,3.819,15.919,neutral
"irritated or sensitive eye situation, but
you're going to be craving carbs.",15.919,5.921,21.84,sad
You're not going to think correctly.,21.84,1.36,23.2,fear
You're going to be looking for sugar.,23.2,2.51,25.71,fear
"What's happening is you have a rebound effect
from insulin being too powerful.",25.71,7.04,32.75,sad
"The insulin is too much, and it's creating
a decrease in the blood sugars.",32.75,3.37,36.12,fear
"Normally it's between 80 and a hundred, and
then anytime you go lower than that, you create",36.12,4.239,40.358999999999995,sad
a situation where you're hypoglycemic.,40.359,3.34,43.699,fear
"Now, the way it works is the pancreas makes
insulin, and it makes another hormone called",43.699,7.84,51.539,sad
glucagon.,51.539,1.0,52.539,NA
"So this is another new word I wanted to help
you understand.",52.539,4.351,56.89,fear
"Glucagon is kind of like, it work with insulin.",56.89,3.269,60.159,fear
"It sort of works ... It works together, not
necessarily opposed, to bring the sugars at",60.159,5.091,65.25,sad
a certain level.,65.25,1.0,66.25,sad
"So glucagon, what that does, it releases stored
sugar in the liver to raise the sugar higher.",66.25,9.92,76.17,sad
"So that way we can always have a balance of,
if something's too high, bring it down.",76.17,4.29,80.46000000000001,sad
"If it's too low, it brings it up.",80.46,1.699,82.15899999999999,fear
"So we have both of these hormones working
together to keep your blood sugars level.",82.159,5.161,87.32000000000001,fear
All right?,87.32,1.88,89.19999999999999,NA
"The real problem that creates this is too
much insulin.",89.2,2.339,91.539,fear
It means you eat too much sugar.,91.539,3.451,94.99,fear
"What triggers insulin is sugar and refined
carbohydrates.",94.99,3.18,98.17,fear
"The body will go in there and take the sugar
out and store it as fat or cholesterol.",98.17,9.189,107.35900000000001,sad
"What happens is that you have glucagon, which
is also going to work in this trigger by protein.",107.359,7.07,114.429,sad
"So that's why, if you take a hypoglycemic
and you give them protein, they feel so much",114.429,3.821,118.25,sad
better.,118.25,1.27,119.52,fear
Why?,119.52,1.269,120.789,fear
"Because you are triggering the release of
sugar, and it's going to raise the sugar,",120.789,4.101,124.89,fear
"and now all of a sudden, the cravings will
go away.",124.89,2.32,127.21,fear
"So that's one way to get rid of cravings for
sweets.",127.21,3.019,130.22899999999998,fear
How do you correct hypoglycemia?,130.229,2.73,132.959,fear
"Number one, you have to keep insulin low,
because it's too high, and you have to avoid",132.959,8.75,141.709,sad
the sugar.,141.709,1.0,142.709,sad
That's number one.,142.709,1.161,143.87,NA
You have to.,143.87,1.0,144.87,fear
"You're never going to heal it, because usually
when you have hypoglycemics what they're doing",144.87,3.589,148.459,fear
"is they're giving into the sugars or they're
eating potatoes or they're having five meals",148.459,7.331,155.79,fear
"a day, which is the biggest mistake, because
every time you eat, you trigger insulin.",155.79,5.9,161.69,fear
"You feel better, but you never crack the problem.",161.69,3.939,165.629,NA
"The insulin goes up, and then it goes down,
and you can start getting diabetes, and it's",165.629,3.67,169.29899999999998,fear
just a nightmare.,169.299,2.481,171.78,sad
"The way to do it is to make sure that you're
consuming protein with each meal, so we keep",171.78,4.97,176.75,fear
this sugar at the certain level.,176.75,2.59,179.34,fear
Then we avoid the sugar.,179.34,3.24,182.58,sad
"Protein avoided sugar, but you also need some
fat to be able to go longer, so you're not",182.58,4.68,187.26000000000002,fear
"having five, six meals a day.",187.26,2.14,189.39999999999998,fear
"With hypoglycemics, they can't last till the
next meal before craving, because the whole",189.4,5.79,195.19,fear
"thing is damaged, so you have to add more
fat to go longer so as to heal insulin, because",195.19,6.391,201.581,fear
we want to not eat so frequent.,201.581,3.548,205.129,fear
"It's cut the sugar out, make sure you have
protein with each meal, don't eat too often,",205.129,6.211,211.34,fear
"add more fat to go longer, and what's going
to happen is you will heal this whole system.",211.34,5.259,216.599,fear
I used to have this problem.,216.599,2.03,218.629,fear
It's completely handled.,218.629,1.0,219.629,sad
"I can go all day without eating, not a problem.",219.629,3.681,223.31,NA
That's what hypoglycemia is.,223.31,2.64,225.95,fear
That's how you correct it.,225.95,1.14,227.08999999999997,fear
It's not that hard.,227.09,1.259,228.349,NA
"One last thing, it's fascinating.",228.349,1.14,229.48899999999998,NA
"You take a diabetic, and they give them insulin,
or they'll give them Formin, and they give",229.489,5.2,234.689,NA
them these sugar pills.,234.689,1.231,235.92,NA
They're glucose pills.,235.92,1.03,236.95,NA
They're synthetic sugar.,236.95,1.899,238.849,NA
"So they tell them, ""If your sugar goes down
to low, to take the sugar pill to raise it",238.849,5.06,243.909,NA
"up.""",243.909,1.86,245.769,NA
"Why don't you just take less medication, because
the medications are lowering the sugar?",245.769,4.78,250.549,NA
"Why would you take more sugar to raise it
up so you can take medication?",250.549,3.44,253.989,NA
That's the worst mistake.,253.989,2.31,256.299,NA
"If you have hypoglycemia, you don't want to
consume fruit, sugar, honey, juice, unless",256.299,6.751,263.04999999999995,NA
"it goes really, really, really low, and it's
dangerous.",263.05,2.66,265.71000000000004,NA
"But if it's coming down a little bit, it's
much better off if you add a little protein,",265.71,6.64,272.34999999999997,NA
okay.,272.35,1.0,273.35,NA
At least so that way you don't stimulate this.,273.35,1.86,275.21000000000004,NA
"Then start adding more healthy foods so you
can get out of this situation.",275.21,4.04,279.25,NA
All right?,279.25,1.26,280.51,NA
Those are some tips.,280.51,1.0,281.51,NA
"Go ahead and apply those, and make some comments
below.",281.51,2.129,283.639,NA
I'll see you in the next video.,283.639,1.03,284.669,NA
