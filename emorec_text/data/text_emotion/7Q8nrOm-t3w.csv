it's increasingly evident that the,3.12,5.519,8.639,angry
microenvironment provides,5.52,5.92,11.44,angry
important drivers,8.639,4.481,13.12,angry
important triggers,11.44,3.119,14.559,angry
that,13.12,3.84,16.96,angry

to the anti-apoptotic phenotype of,18.4,3.76,22.159999999999997,angry
cellular cells,20.72,4.16,24.88,angry
i mean i'll simply um,22.16,6.16,28.32,angry
focus on what we have recently published,24.88,4.96,29.84,angry
and,28.32,5.04,33.36,angry
what we managed to show is a new,29.84,4.64,34.48,angry
axis,33.36,2.719,36.079,neutral
a new,34.48,3.84,38.31999999999999,neutral
intracellular axis,36.079,4.721,40.8,neutral
that is however triggered by the micro,38.32,3.759,42.079,neutral
environment,40.8,2.4,43.199999999999996,fear
so,42.079,2.32,44.399,fear
in,43.2,3.519,46.719,angry
a group of patients,44.399,4.761,49.160000000000004,angry
that are highly responsive to,46.719,4.641,51.36,angry
microenvironmental triggers,49.16,5.0,54.16,angry
and this group broadly overlaps,51.36,5.039,56.399,angry
with those carrying unmutated,54.16,4.8,58.959999999999994,angry
immunoglobulin genes we find,56.399,5.201,61.6,angry
considerable upregulation of a protein,58.96,5.76,64.72,angry
called top 63,61.6,4.08,65.68,angry
and,64.72,5.92,70.64,angry
what we managed to show is that top 63,65.68,7.84,73.52000000000001,angry
overexpression in those patients is,70.64,4.96,75.6,neutral
linked is accompanied,73.52,3.599,77.119,neutral
call it as you wish,75.6,3.44,79.03999999999999,angry
with bcl2,77.119,5.481,82.6,angry
over expression so bcl2 is a key,79.04,6.719,85.759,angry
anti-apoptotic player in cellular cells,82.6,4.199,86.79899999999999,angry

in other words,92.0,3.84,95.84,angry
they don't die when they should,93.36,4.399,97.759,angry
so,95.84,6.0,101.84,angry
what we showed is a link between top 63,97.759,5.841,103.6,angry
