it's increasingly evident that the,3.12,5.519,8.639,sad

cellular cells,20.72,4.16,24.88,sad
i mean i'll simply um,22.16,6.16,28.32,sad
focus on what we have recently published,24.88,4.96,29.84,sad
and,28.32,5.04,33.36,sad
what we managed to show is a new,29.84,4.64,34.48,sad

a new,34.48,3.84,38.31999999999999,sad

that is however triggered by the micro,38.32,3.759,42.079,sad
environment,40.8,2.4,43.199999999999996,sad
so,42.079,2.32,44.399,sad
in,43.2,3.519,46.719,sad
a group of patients,44.399,4.761,49.160000000000004,sad
that are highly responsive to,46.719,4.641,51.36,sad
microenvironmental triggers,49.16,5.0,54.16,sad
and this group broadly overlaps,51.36,5.039,56.399,sad
with those carrying unmutated,54.16,4.8,58.959999999999994,sad

what we managed to show is that top 63,65.68,7.84,73.52000000000001,sad
overexpression in those patients is,70.64,4.96,75.6,sad
linked is accompanied,73.52,3.599,77.119,neutral
call it as you wish,75.6,3.44,79.03999999999999,neutral
with bcl2,77.119,5.481,82.6,neutral

they don't die when they should,93.36,4.399,97.759,sad

what we showed is a link between top 63,97.759,5.841,103.6,fear
