lead a healthier life you may have heard the terms by Simic index or glycemic load being mentioned when your doctor's discuss nutrition and health they're helpful dietary concepts once we get,15.9,22.948999999999998,38.849,NA
down to basics the glycemic index is used to classify foods based on how quickly they cause a rise in blood sugar upon being eaten when high glycemic index foods are eaten there's a rapid,27.33,24.0,51.33,angry
rise in blood sugar followed by a significant release of insulin causing blood sugar levels to fall creating fatigue and hunger consistently eating high glycemic index foods may lessen,39.809,25.531,65.34,angry
your body's sensitivity to insulin over time leading to type-2 diabetes and other illnesses sugar and white bread are considered reference foods and have been assigned to glycemic index of 100,52.32,24.799,77.119,NA
because they both caused a rapid rise in blood sugar levels after ingestion all other foods are assigned a proportionately lower value from 1 to 99 based on how they affect blood sugar,64.549,27.43,91.97900000000001,angry
compared to sugar or white bread low glycemic index foods are digested more slowly resulting in a gentle rise in blood sugar followed by a more moderate release of insulin thereby helping to,77.82,24.03,101.85,angry
maintain consistent blood glucose levels and lessening fatigue and by Seema Clos takes the concept of glycemic index a step further offering a more accurate reflection of the impact,90.39,25.531,115.92099999999999,angry
eating a specific food has on your blood sugar and insulin levels the glycemic load takes into account the relative amount of carbohydrate the food contains in an average serving as an example,103.08,25.458999999999996,128.539,NA
watermelon has a glycemic index of 72 which is pretty high but it's mostly made up of water and contains relatively little carbohydrate so it's glycemic load is only between 4 and 7 now your,115.52,27.851,143.37099999999998,NA
blood sugar may go up rapidly after eating watermelon but it shouldn't go up very much since there's not much carbohydrate present and watermelon to be converted into sugar in the first,130.05,21.09,151.14000000000001,NA

there are many reference lists that detail the glycemic index and glycemic load of your favorite foods and both by scenic index and glycemic load are helpful guides when choosing healthy,153.299,22.44,175.739,angry

a given food have to be factored in as well I hope this helps clear up any confusion around by Simac index and glycemic load for you be well to watch the other segments in this video series,176.07,27.389,203.459,angry
