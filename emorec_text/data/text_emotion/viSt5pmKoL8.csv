I'm dr. John Peterson a member of the boiling River clinic and today we're going to talk about gastroparesis gastroparesis is a chronic and debilitating condition that affects the,9.22,22.46,31.68,angry
stomach how the stomach accepts a meal digests the meal and makes the meal leave the stomach in a coordinated fashion and people with guests or phoresis have lost that ability to empty,20.98,23.44,44.42,angry
from their stomach properly as a result they have a lot of symptoms symptoms that can be somewhat acute and others that go on for years at a time this can be nausea the feeling of,32.59,24.720000000000002,57.31,fear
fullness after a meal abdominal pain bloating gas belching regurgitating and and at times very debilitating weight loss the first step would be to take a careful history to examine the patient,44.62,28.29,72.91,fear
care plate and then consider an upper endoscopy to examine the stomach and see if there's something inherently wrong with this at times we'll also do an ultrasound or a cat scan to look at the,59.17,20.61,79.78,fear
rest of the abdominal contents and make sure that they're in good working order if we find that the stomach looks good and there's no inflammation there's no ulceration or polyp or mass or,69.49,21.689999999999998,91.17999999999999,fear
obstruction to the outflow of the stomach that's when we take our next step and that's the view what's called a gastric emptying study that's a study done by the nuclear medicine department,80.17,24.479999999999997,104.65,fear
of radiology Center and once we have that information if we find that the stomach is significantly delayed and how it works then we have the diagnosis of gastroparesis this is a disorder that,92.26,26.128,118.388,fear
commonly is seen in diabetics very commonly probably 40 to 50 percent of diabetics at some time in their lives will have a component of a gastric emptying disorder once we've confirmed,105.549,24.482,130.031,fear
that they truly have gastroparesis be it on a diabetic nature or a so-called idiopathic nature we then try medications we change their diets to see if that'll have some benefit but in my,117.07,26.01,143.07999999999998,fear
experience diet has that made a big difference in the treatment of gastric and now the option that we have is gastric stimulation or gastric pacing and we have just recently started,130.75,23.759999999999998,154.51,fear
inserting these gastric pacemakers at Baptist Hospital downtown with the assistance of a very fine laparoscopic surgeon who actually places the pacemaker this is the so-called,142.72,25.14,167.86,fear
antara the gastric stimulating device this is its actual size and shape and dimension you can see it's very thin for a low profile weighs only a couple of ounces this is inserted by the surgeon,154.87,29.82,184.69,fear
at Baptist downtown into a small pouch on the abdominal wall the leads that are attached to the pacemaker are then placed in the lower part of the stomach itself and this computerized module,169.96,31.080000000000002,201.04000000000002,fear
shows me exactly call that particular generator is working how much time it has taken off its battery supply how much voltage is putting out with it each stimulation to contract the stomach the,185.02,29.040000000000003,214.06,fear
frequency the resistance all of these things can be very carefully monitored within this computerized module anywhere from 50 to 75 percent of patients that are paced will have improvement in their,199.75,27.93,227.68,NA
overall symptoms their quality of life will improve the frequency of the nausea and vomiting spells will go down the episodes requiring emergency room visits and hospitalizations are drastically,214.21,25.830000000000002,240.04000000000002,NA
reduced office visits the use of other medications for pain and nausea reduced we know this it's it's been a national fact that this has shown to be a very positive experience so we're very happy,226.42,26.990000000000002,253.41,NA
