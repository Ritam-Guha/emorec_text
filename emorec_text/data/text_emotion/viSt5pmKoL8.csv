I'm dr. John Peterson a member of the,9.22,4.77,13.99,
boiling River clinic and today we're,12.31,3.559,15.869,
going to talk about gastroparesis,13.99,4.47,18.46,
gastroparesis is a chronic and,15.869,5.111,20.98,
debilitating condition that affects the,18.46,4.55,23.01,fear
stomach how the stomach accepts a meal,20.98,4.889,25.869,fear
digests the meal and makes the meal,23.01,5.589,28.599000000000004,
leave the stomach in a coordinated,25.869,4.261,30.13,
fashion and people with guests or,28.599,3.991,32.59,fear
phoresis have lost that ability to empty,30.13,4.71,34.839999999999996,fear
from their stomach properly as a result,32.59,4.98,37.57000000000001,fear
they have a lot of symptoms symptoms,34.84,5.07,39.910000000000004,fear
that can be somewhat acute and others,37.57,4.23,41.8,fear
that go on for years at a time,39.91,4.71,44.62,fear
this can be nausea the feeling of,41.8,5.73,47.53,fear
fullness after a meal abdominal pain,44.62,6.86,51.48,fear
bloating gas belching regurgitating and,47.53,6.93,54.46,fear
and at times very debilitating weight,51.48,5.26,56.739999999999995,fear
loss the first step would be to take a,54.46,4.71,59.17,fear
careful history to examine the patient,56.74,4.53,61.27,fear
care plate and then consider an upper,59.17,4.62,63.79,
endoscopy to examine the stomach and see,61.27,3.87,65.14,
if there's something inherently wrong,63.79,3.66,67.45,
with this at times we'll also do an,65.14,4.35,69.49,fear
ultrasound or a cat scan to look at the,67.45,4.11,71.56,fear
rest of the abdominal contents and make,69.49,3.83,73.32,fear
sure that they're in good working order,71.56,4.08,75.64,fear
if we find that the stomach looks good,73.32,4.51,77.83,fear
and there's no inflammation there's no,75.64,4.53,80.17,fear
ulceration or polyp or mass or,77.83,4.74,82.57,fear
obstruction to the outflow of the,80.17,4.71,84.88,fear
stomach that's when we take our next,82.57,4.409,86.979,fear
step and that's the view what's called a,84.88,5.07,89.94999999999999,fear
gastric emptying study that's a study,86.979,5.281,92.26,fear
done by the nuclear medicine department,89.95,5.01,94.96000000000001,neutral
of radiology Center and once we have,92.26,4.71,96.97,neutral
that information if we find that the,94.96,4.32,99.28,neutral
stomach is significantly delayed and how,96.97,5.0,101.97,fear
it works then we have the diagnosis of,99.28,6.269,105.549,fear
gastroparesis this is a disorder that,101.97,5.829,107.79899999999999,fear
commonly is seen in diabetics very,105.549,4.771,110.32000000000001,fear
commonly probably 40 to 50 percent of,107.799,4.711,112.51,fear
diabetics at some time in their lives,110.32,4.979,115.29899999999999,fear
will have a component of a gastric,112.51,4.56,117.07000000000001,fear
emptying disorder once we've confirmed,115.299,5.461,120.76,fear
that they truly have gastroparesis be it,117.07,6.12,123.19,
on a diabetic nature or a so-called,120.76,5.1,125.86,fear
idiopathic nature we then try,123.19,5.67,128.85999999999999,fear
medications we change their diets to see,125.86,4.89,130.75,fear
if that'll have some benefit but in my,128.86,4.23,133.09,fear
experience diet has that made a big,130.75,4.74,135.49,fear
difference in the treatment of gastric,133.09,4.71,137.8,neutral
and now the option that we have is,135.49,5.25,140.74,fear
gastric stimulation or gastric pacing,137.8,4.92,142.72,fear
and we have just recently started,140.74,4.14,144.88,neutral
inserting these gastric pacemakers at,142.72,4.59,147.31,neutral
Baptist Hospital downtown with the,144.88,4.08,148.96,neutral
assistance of a very fine,147.31,4.23,151.54,neutral
laparoscopic surgeon who actually places,148.96,5.91,154.87,
the pacemaker this is the so-called,151.54,6.33,157.87,
antara the gastric stimulating device,154.87,6.03,160.9,fear
this is its actual size and shape and,157.87,5.46,163.33,fear
dimension you can see it's very thin for,160.9,5.49,166.39000000000001,fear
a low profile weighs only a couple of,163.33,6.63,169.96,fear
ounces this is inserted by the surgeon,166.39,6.21,172.6,fear
at Baptist downtown into a small pouch,169.96,6.15,176.11,fear
on the abdominal wall the leads that are,172.6,6.39,178.98999999999998,fear
attached to the pacemaker are then,176.11,5.07,181.18,
placed in the lower part of the stomach,178.99,6.03,185.02,fear
itself and this computerized module,181.18,7.44,188.62,fear
shows me exactly call that particular,185.02,6.78,191.8,fear
generator is working how much time it,188.62,5.64,194.26,fear
has taken off its battery supply how,191.8,4.79,196.59,
much voltage is putting out with it each,194.26,5.49,199.75,
stimulation to contract the stomach the,196.59,6.34,202.93,
frequency the resistance all of these,199.75,5.13,204.88,
things can be very carefully monitored,202.93,5.91,208.84,
within this computerized module anywhere,204.88,6.81,211.69,
from 50 to 75 percent of patients that,208.84,5.37,214.21,NA
are paced will have improvement in their,211.69,4.71,216.4,NA
overall symptoms their quality of life,214.21,5.07,219.28,NA
will improve the frequency of the nausea,216.4,5.28,221.68,NA
and vomiting spells will go down the,219.28,5.04,224.32,NA
episodes requiring emergency room visits,221.68,4.74,226.42000000000002,NA
and hospitalizations are drastically,224.32,5.7,230.01999999999998,NA
reduced office visits the use of other,226.42,6.84,233.26,NA
medications for pain and nausea reduced,230.02,5.61,235.63000000000002,NA
we know this it's it's been a national,233.26,4.53,237.79,NA
fact that this has shown to be a very,235.63,4.62,240.25,NA
positive experience so we're very happy,237.79,5.39,243.17999999999998,NA
to be part of that experience,240.25,2.93,243.18,NA
you,252.36,2.06,254.42000000000002,NA
