"Diabetic nephropathy refers to the kidney
damage caused by both type I and type II diabetes. Because of the growing number of people affected
by diabetes, diabetic nephropathy is currently the leading cause of end-stage renal disease
in most developed countries around the world. Each kidney has millions of nephrons, each
of which is served by a tiny capillary bed called a glomerulus.",4.0,23.26,27.26,NA
"The tiny arteriole that approaches the glomerulus
is called the afferent arteriole - a for approaching, and the arteriole that exits the glomerulus
is called the efferent arteriole - e for exits. The glomeruli are a tiny cluster of capillaries
that are physically supported by mesangial cells. So when blood is filtered it moves through
the endothelium lining the capillary, then",27.26,22.630000000000003,49.89,NA
"through the basement membrane, and then through
the epithelium lining the nephron, and finally into the nephron itself - at which point its
called filtrate. The endothelium has pores that keep cells
from entering the filtrate, and the basement membrane is negatively charged
and repels other negatively charged molecules and proteins, like the protein albumin.",49.89,22.72,72.61,NA
"The epithelium has of special cell type called
a podocyte which looks like an octopus because it has foot processes that wrap around the
basement membrane, leaving tiny gaps between its octopus-like projections called filtration
slits. In diabetes mellitus, there’s an excess
of glucose in the blood, because it can’t get into cells, and when blood gets filtered
through the kidneys, some of that excess glucose",72.61,24.84,97.45,NA
"starts to spill into the urine, called glycosuria. In addition, when there’s a lot of glucose
in the blood, it also starts sticking to proteins in the blood — a process called non-enzymatic
glycation because no enzymes are involved. Because glucose can get through the endothelium,
this process of glycation can also involve the basement membrane of small blood vessels
making it thicken.",97.45,28.749999999999996,126.2,NA
"The process particularly affects the efferent
arteriole causing it to get stiff and more narrow - a process called hyaline arteriosclerosis. This creates an obstruction that makes it
difficult for blood to leave the glomerulus, increasing pressure within the glomerulus. At the same time, the afferent arteriole dilates,
allowing more blood flow into the glomerulus",126.2,23.83,150.03,NA
"and increasing pressure further. High pressure in the glomerulus leads to an
increase in the glomerular filtration rate--which is simply the amount of blood filtered through
per minute. This is the first stage of diabetic nephropathy,
called hyperfiltration. In response to this high-pressure state, the
supportive mesangial cells secrete more and",150.03,22.179000000000002,172.209,NA
"more structural matrix expanding the size
of the glomerulus. This matrix deposition and mesangial expansion
happen uniformly, or it can result in little nodules within the mesangium called Kimmelstiel-Wilson
nodules - which are tiny little balls of protein. The thickening of the basement membrane counterintuitively
makes it more permeable—allowing proteins like albumin through that otherwise would
have been filtered out.",172.209,27.871000000000002,200.08,NA
"It makes sense if you think about our octopus
friend once more - as the glomerulus expands, the legs of the octopus naturally have larger
gaps between them, in other words the filtration slits widen, making it easier for substances
to slip through. So in the end, the key abnormalities in diabetic
nephropathy are a thickened glomerular basement membrane, mesangial expansion, Kimmelstiel-Wilson
nodules, and disruption of the podocytes.",200.08,27.98,228.06,NA
"Eventually, these changes damage the glomerulus
so much that it's unable to filter blood normally, and the glomerular filtration rate decreases. Typically, diabetic nephropathy starts quietly
with no symptoms during the hyperfiltration phase, but over time as more and more of the
nephrons are affected, the kidney becomes less and less effective and filtering the
blood into the urine, and the glomerular filtration",228.06,26.259000000000004,254.31900000000002,NA
"rate decreases dramatically . Once the kidneys
no longer can do their job of filtering the blood, end stage renal disease results. Because there are no overt symptoms of diabetic
nephropathy, regularly screening the urine of individuals with diabetes is super important. Microalbuminuria, which means excreting 30
to 300 mg of albumin in a day, is a reliable",254.319,27.651,281.96999999999997,NA
"signal that diabetic nephropathy has started
to set in. Excreting above 300 mg per day is considered
macroalbuminuria, and is a sure sign of a problem. Unfortunately, diabetic nephropathy is a progressive
complication that can be significantly slowed down but not completely stopped.",281.97,21.64,303.61,NA
"Keeping tight control on hypertension and
hyperglycemia is critical. Specifically, angiotensin-converting enzymes
(ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers can be particularly useful. These not only lower blood pressure as a whole,
but they also specifically reduce constriction of the efferent arteriole.",303.61,19.778999999999996,323.389,NA
"By reducing this constriction, the pressure
within the glomerulus and the damage that comes from it. Alright, as a quick recap, diabetic nephropathy
is kidney damage that is caused by diabetes, resulting in glomerular basement membrane
thickening, mesangial expansion, and sclerosis. An initial phase of increased glomerular filtration
rate is followed by progressive albuminuria,",323.389,23.869999999999997,347.259,NA
"then a gradual decline in glomerular filtration
rate, and finally renal failure. This progression can be slowed by tight control
of blood sugar and blood pressure and the use of ACE-inhibitors or angiotensin receptor
blockers to decrease pressure specifically within the glomerulus. Thanks for watching, you can help support
