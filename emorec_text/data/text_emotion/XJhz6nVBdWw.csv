[Music] i'm dr hill a bariatric surgeon with live healthy md and today we're going to talk about the gastric bypass,2.31,18.948999999999998,21.258999999999997,sad
the gastric bypass is the second most commonly performed weight loss procedure weight loss surgeons have been doing this operation for over 40 years the first bypass procedure was performed,14.08,22.558,36.638,sad
in the 1960s and began as an open procedure meaning doctors would make a large incision in the abdomen to perform the surgery although the morbidity and mortality,25.599,22.481,48.08,sad
rates were low for these open bypass procedures they resulted in more wound related complications such as infections in the early 2000s,36.48,20.881,57.361,sad
surgeons made the transition to performing the bypass and other bariatric procedures laparoscopically which is the only surgical technique we,47.28,17.6,64.88,NA
use in our practice today the gastric bypass is a result of dividing and stapling the stomach to create a smaller upper pouch about the size of an egg,55.52,23.92,79.44,sad
that is separate from the large main stomach the operation also involves rerounding the intestines so that the main part of the stomach in,67.68,17.439,85.119,sad
the first part of the small intestine is bypassed as a result food and digestive juices will travel down separate limbs of intestines this altered anatomy allows an,76.56,24.0,100.56,sad
individual to consume smaller portions due to a smaller stomach size while also absorbing fewer calories as much as the intestines are bypassed however we also believe that there are,88.479,22.480999999999998,110.96,sad
more important mechanisms in play that will result in weight loss we have seen that when food is prevented from touching the lining of the first part of the intestines,99.68,19.12,118.80000000000001,sad
hormones that help regulate your metabolism are altered this allows individuals to lose weight when it was previously not possible through,109.6,17.439,127.03899999999999,sad
other conscious means since the digestion process is altered with the gastric bypass this can result in nutritional deficiencies,117.759,18.72,136.47899999999998,sad
therefore is critical to take your vitamins and supplements after bariatric surgery to prevent significant nutrient deficiencies also the gastric bypass can cause,127.04,22.881,149.921,sad
dumping syndrome dumping syndrome is a result of eating high sugar foods that move through the body too fast,139.04,16.719,155.759,sad
resulting in loose bowel movements this can be managed by eating a healthy diet like all surgical procedures the gastric bypass does come with its risks major complications that could result in,146.879,24.400000000000002,171.279,sad
re-operation include internal bleeding bowel leaks or bowel obstruction other complications that would not require re-operation include blood clots in a leg,159.92,25.679,185.599,sad
a pulmonary embolism or ulcers although scary these complications are rare and occur in less than one percent of our patients minor complications after surgery might also,171.519,21.602,193.121,sad
occur such as wound infections vomiting or nausea acid reflux also known as heartburn or changes in the bowel habits such as,183.68,19.279,202.959,sad
constipation bloating or gas these complications are also uncommon and can be managed fairly easily without further surgery as a patient goes,193.12,22.16,215.28,sad
through our program we will make sure that they fully understand all the potential risks associated with their procedure the gastric bypass procedure takes about one,204.239,20.240000000000002,224.479,sad
hour to perform and patients can expect to stay at the hospital for up to 48 hours after surgery depending on the type of work performed,214.319,18.720999999999997,233.04,sad
patients will be able to return to work within one to four weeks from surgery patients who have gastric bypass surgery can expect to lose 70 to 75 percent of their excess body,223.44,21.279999999999998,244.72,sad
weight within the first year about 75 percent of patients who undergo gastric bypass surgery are able to keep off at least 50 percent,234.64,20.479,255.11899999999997,NA
of their excess weight for 10 years or longer other benefits of gastric bypass surgery aside from weight loss include better health and an improvement,244.08,18.000999999999998,262.081,NA
or resolution of serious health conditions long-term cost savings as a result of reduced medical care and an improvement in a patient's,253.68,18.8,272.48,NA
quality of life studies have shown that patients who have had bariatric surgery feel better and spend more time during recreational,262.72,18.8,281.52000000000004,NA
and physical activities similarly patients who have lost a significant amount of weight experience more self-confidence and are more likely to become more social,271.44,20.639999999999997,292.08,NA
the gastric bypass is a highly effective bariatric procedure that can help patients achieve their weight goal despite this complicated nature of this procedure it is reversible,282.08,23.119,305.19899999999996,NA
and is able to be revised as needed,291.759,6.081,297.84000000000003,NA
