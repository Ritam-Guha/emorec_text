i'm dr hill,6.72,4.08,10.8,happy
a bariatric surgeon with live healthy md,8.0,4.08,12.08,happy
and today we're going to talk about the,10.8,3.28,14.08,happy
gastric bypass,12.08,4.0,16.08,fear
the gastric bypass is the second most,14.08,4.88,18.96,fear
commonly performed weight loss procedure,16.08,4.48,20.56,fear
weight loss surgeons have been doing,18.96,4.399,23.359,fear
this operation for over 40 years,20.56,5.039,25.598999999999997,fear
the first bypass procedure was performed,23.359,3.76,27.119,fear
in the 1960s,25.599,3.76,29.359,fear
and began as an open procedure meaning,27.119,4.48,31.599,fear
doctors would make a large incision,29.359,5.121,34.480000000000004,neutral
in the abdomen to perform the surgery,31.599,4.881,36.480000000000004,neutral
although the morbidity and mortality,34.48,4.239,38.718999999999994,fear
rates were low for these open bypass,36.48,3.36,39.839999999999996,fear
procedures,38.719,3.201,41.92,fear
they resulted in more wound related,39.84,3.36,43.2,fear
complications,41.92,5.36,47.28,neutral
such as infections in the early 2000s,43.2,5.6,48.800000000000004,neutral
surgeons made the transition to,47.28,3.04,50.32,
performing the bypass and,48.8,3.48,52.279999999999994,
other bariatric procedures,50.32,3.36,53.68,
laparoscopically,52.28,3.24,55.52,
which is the only surgical technique we,53.68,4.48,58.16,
use in our practice today,55.52,5.199,60.719,
the gastric bypass is a result of,58.16,4.559,62.718999999999994,
dividing and stapling the stomach to,60.719,3.281,64.0,
create a smaller,62.719,4.961,67.68,
upper pouch about the size of an egg,64.0,5.92,69.92,
that is separate from the large main,67.68,3.119,70.799,
stomach,69.92,3.68,73.60000000000001,
the operation also involves rerounding,70.799,4.0,74.799,
the intestines,73.6,2.96,76.55999999999999,
so that the main part of the stomach in,74.799,3.68,78.47900000000001,
the first part of the small intestine,76.56,5.12,81.68,fear
is bypassed as a result,78.479,5.28,83.759,fear
food and digestive juices will travel,81.68,4.799,86.47900000000001,fear
down separate limbs of intestines,83.759,4.72,88.479,fear
this altered anatomy allows an,86.479,4.081,90.56,fear
individual to consume smaller portions,88.479,4.161,92.64,fear
due to a smaller stomach size,90.56,4.879,95.43900000000001,fear
while also absorbing fewer calories as,92.64,5.04,97.68,fear
much as the intestines are bypassed,95.439,4.241,99.67999999999999,
however we also believe that there are,97.68,4.16,101.84,fear
more important mechanisms in play,99.68,4.719,104.399,fear
that will result in weight loss we have,101.84,4.48,106.32000000000001,neutral
seen that when food is prevented,104.399,3.601,108.0,neutral
from touching the lining of the first,106.32,3.28,109.6,neutral
part of the intestines,108.0,3.04,111.04,neutral
hormones that help regulate your,109.6,3.519,113.119,neutral
metabolism are altered,111.04,4.56,115.60000000000001,fear
this allows individuals to lose weight,113.119,4.161,117.28,fear
when it was previously not possible,115.6,2.159,117.759,fear
through,117.28,3.04,120.32000000000001,fear
other conscious means since the,117.759,4.801,122.56,fear
digestion process is altered with the,120.32,3.68,124.0,fear
gastric bypass,122.56,3.04,125.60000000000001,
this can result in nutritional,124.0,3.04,127.04,
deficiencies,125.6,4.159,129.759,fear
therefore is critical to take your,127.04,4.32,131.36,fear
vitamins and supplements,129.759,3.761,133.51999999999998,fear

significant nutrient deficiencies,133.52,5.52,139.04000000000002,fear
also the gastric bypass can cause,136.56,4.08,140.64000000000001,fear
dumping syndrome,139.04,3.919,142.959,fear
dumping syndrome is a result of eating,140.64,3.12,143.76,fear
high sugar,142.959,2.961,145.92000000000002,fear
foods that move through the body too,143.76,3.119,146.879,fear
fast,145.92,3.6,149.51999999999998,fear
resulting in loose bowel movements this,146.879,5.521,152.39999999999998,fear
can be managed by eating a healthy diet,149.52,5.28,154.8,neutral
like all surgical procedures the gastric,152.4,5.36,157.76000000000002,fear
bypass does come with its risks,154.8,5.12,159.92000000000002,fear
major complications that could result in,157.76,3.119,160.879,
re-operation,159.92,4.72,164.64,fear
