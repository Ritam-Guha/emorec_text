Reviewer: Denise RQ Hello, my name is Dave
and I am an anorexic. I have been recovering from anorexia
for the past eight or nine years; everyone needs a hobby. (Laughter)",0.0,20.360999999999997,20.360999999999997,NA
"That is what this is all about. Before we kick off, I am
very comfortable talking about this. I do not want anyone
to be awkward or kind of cringing. You can see me,
I am not butch or tough. I will be honest; I do not even
have a strong bladder.",22.521,15.594999999999999,38.116,NA
"(Laughter) That is what this is for.
It is just a massive TENA pad. (Laughter) If you saw me in the street,
you are not going to think, ""Phwoa! There is an alpha male.""",38.121,11.634999999999998,49.756,NA
"Much more likely, ""Oh, vegetarian!"" (Laughter) You would be right because
I have been veggie for a while now. There are certain things that I miss. A lot of respect.",52.133,12.776,64.909,NA
"(Laughter) There is a really good
reason that I bring it up. There are 1.6 million people in the UK
that suffer with eating disorders. Probably more, because a lot of people
feel embarrassed to talk about it. A lot of people do not realise
that they are suffering,",64.914,16.829,81.743,NA
"and that was exactly the same for me. A lot of my friends,
when I slipped into all of this, asked me how I was losing
so much weight so quickly, and I guess I was embarrassed. I used to tell them it was a combination",82.677,12.17,94.84700000000001,NA
"of the Atkins diet,
coupled with being vegetarian. (Laughter) Just sounds much nicer, right? By trade, I am a stand-up comic and I love the unique ability
that comedy has to reach people.",94.852,18.677,113.529,NA
"I really wanted to use that
in order to help, and in order to change
how we see mental health. It was a difficult show to write. It was a really tricky one
because I had to be funny, but I had to be informative as well.",113.534,15.486,129.02,NA
"Obviously I wanted to be sensitive. We did not always get the balance right. When we took it on tour
to the Leicester Comedy Festival, one of the first reviews said that the bit
I did on bulimia was too, ""Gag-heavy"". (Laughter)",129.025,13.903,142.928,NA
"It is like saying a show on domestic
violence lacks punchlines. But it is absolutely true. I want to promote change,
especially towards mental health, because we have not changed
our attitude in the UK to mental health since the Victorian era, really.",144.552,15.742999999999999,160.295,NA
"Then we would have freak shows,
now we have reality TV. We just have not come that far,
and I wanted to use that. I will never forget the first time
that I ever tried this in a show. It was awkward. It was horrible,
it was awkward, everyone was really... and it wasn't ready.",160.3,17.801000000000002,178.101,NA
"After the show, a woman came up to me,
and she stood there, and she said, ""You were not really anorexic, were you?"" I could not help but think,
""Are you calling me fat?"" (Laughter) I said, ""It is all absolutely true.""",178.106,14.616999999999999,192.72299999999998,NA
"She just turned around,
and she walked off. I thought, ""I have offended this woman,""
and that is the last thing I want to do. Then five minutes later, she came back,
and she stood there, and she said, ""I can help you.
I can help you get over this."" Then from behind her back,
she produced a packet of crisps.",194.257,22.232,216.489,NA
"Like the answer to this neurological,
psychological, mental health disorder was a packet of Monster Munch. It was only then that I realised how little people
actually know about this. So I decided to start telling my story.",216.494,17.116999999999997,233.611,NA
"For me, this all began when I was 17, and I had just got
the lead role in a play. It was a play called, ""Sparkleshark"". (Laughter) I am not even gay.",233.616,13.377999999999998,246.994,NA
(Laughter) I am as surprised as you. (Laughter) So is my boyfriend. (Laughter),247.018,8.549,255.567,NA
"I am not homophobic either. Some of my best friends enjoy musicals. (Laughter) I am of course kidding. I am a very left-wing person,
I am very liberal.",258.7,10.675999999999998,269.376,NA
"The only thing I cannot
tolerate is gluten. I got this role in this play,
and I had to appear topless. I guess it was the first time that I have
ever had to think about my body. I decided to lose a little bit of weight. I just did the usual thing;
cut out snacking.",269.381,16.782,286.16299999999995,NA
"I just had three meals,
and I lost a bit of weight. Wanted to lose more,
so I cut out breakfast, just had two meals,
lost a bit of weight. Wanted to lose a bit more, and then cut out breakfast
and dinner and just had tea,",287.007,10.933,297.94,NA
"and lost a bit more. It was a great way to save
money on food bills. Although what I did lose in weight,
I also lost in Nectar points. (Laughter) It is not all happy families.",297.945,12.209,310.154,NA
"As I lost the weight, something
incredible happened, and I got noticed by this one amazing,
beautiful, wonderful, awesome girl. For legal reasons,
I am not going to name her. I am not going to get within 50 feet
of her after this goes online. All you need to know is she was amazing,
we started dating, and I fell in love.",310.159,21.505,331.664,NA
"She became my heroine. By which I mean, she was addictive,
exciting, and blooming expensive. But like heroine, she also became
a cause for me to lose weight; she became an inspiration to draw
me on, to lose more of my fat. Not that she ever made me. I really
want to get that across as well.",332.598,20.089000000000002,352.687,NA
"She actually never actively
made me lost weight. She hated that I was skinnier than her. I will never forget one conversation. ""Does my bum look big in this"" ""No, Dave.""",353.651,11.067,364.718,NA
"(Laughter) ""I am over this."" You have to understand that in my mind, I correlated getting skinny
with getting this incredible girl. In my mind, I correlated getting skinny
with being good-looking,",364.723,12.154000000000002,376.877,NA
"skinny meant success. I know that is mental now. I understand no girl has ever been asked,
""What do you look for in the ideal bloke?"" ""Ooh, rickets!"" (Laughter)",376.88,10.948,387.828,NA
"In my mind, that made sense. Inevitably when we broke up
and she broke my heart, that was when it spiraled out of control. If we are talking about change,
one of the things that I want to change is that anorexia is not to do with vanity,
and it is very little to do with weight.",387.833,15.988,403.821,NA
"It is about addiction,
obsession, and control. For example, I became absolutely
obsessed with exercising. Anytime I had eaten anything,
no matter how much, I would run upstairs to my room,
I would do 50 push-ups, I would do 50 sit-ups
and I would do 20 squats.",403.826,18.186,422.012,NA
"It was then that my mum and dad
realised that something was up. They never approached me. They never
said anything to me about this. I did not know the reason
until I asked them recently. I said to my mum, ""Why, when you knew
something was up with the exercise, why didn't you say anything to me?""",422.017,18.293,440.31,NA
"She gave the most beautiful answer. She said, ""Dave, when your teenage son
keeps on running up to his room, and all you can hear is rhythmical
banging, followed by repeated grunting, you tend not to ask questions."" I thought it was really sweet until my dad
put his hand on her shoulder and said,",440.315,19.485,459.8,NA
"""I thought you were a sex pest"". (Laughter) ""Sex pest"". You never expected
those words at TEDx. Also, I became obsessed with weighing
myself, on a neurological level. I started weighing myself in the morning,",459.805,14.046,473.851,NA
"then I started weighing
myself in the evening, to see how much my weight fluctuated. Then mid-day to inspire me to eat less. On average, about five times a day, I used to run upstairs, lock
my door, and weigh myself.",476.275,13.184999999999999,489.46,NA
"Five times a day,
I used to lock myself away. Dad thought I converted to Islam. When he found out what was going on, he said, ""Oh, I thought I was going
to have to buy you a Qur'an."" I said, ""Dad, we have been
over this. I am vegetarian.",489.465,15.581,505.046,NA
"It is pronounced 'Quorn'."" (Laughter) Side-note on that: when we did
The Birmingham Comedy Festival, a lovely Muslim fellow came
up to me after the show, and he said, ""I really enjoyed the show,
it was absolutely lovely.",505.051,12.703,517.754,NA
"But you are a very weak person. Because what you call, ""anorexia"",
us Islamists just call Ramadan."" (Laughter) Really nice. I also became obsessed
with calories as well.",517.765,12.096,529.861,NA
"Obsessed with calorie counting. To reduce calories,
I reduced portion sizes, so what I called, ""Sunday lunch"",
everyone else just called ""tapas"". It was weird for my mum
and dad at this point in time; I am cheaper to feed than the cat was.",531.581,15.442999999999998,547.024,NA
"They did not know what to do. They went and sought help in the church,
they tried to drag me along. I was going nowhere near that place. Bread and wine? Talk about empty calories. I heard stories of miracles
and was entirely unimpressed.",547.029,14.8,561.829,NA
"Five loaves, two fishes, 5,000 people. That is plenty to go around, you know? Because I did not realise I had a problem,
until I ended up in hospital. I ended up in hospital
due to coffee-loading. Side-note on that: in case
you do not know what that is,",561.834,18.930999999999997,580.765,NA
"""coffee-loading"" is where
you substitute food for coffee. Coffee gives you all of the energy,
but none of the calories of food. Something you might not
realise about coffee is that coffee reduces
your pulse rate when you do not eat. Because you have got no fuel in your body,
that reduces your pulse too.",580.77,19.369999999999997,600.14,NA
"Mine got down to about 46 beats a minute. If you get anywhere below 40, it is what is medically
known as 'heart block'. And unfortunately,
it is incompatible with life. I got rushed to the hospital,
and as I sat there,",600.145,16.623,616.768,NA
"I got talking to this building, builder. (Laughter) It was going so well! Do not worry. They will
fix that in the edit! Just to ruin it, I am going
to do it on this side now.",616.773,12.950999999999999,629.724,NA
"The editor is going to have
a massive field day. Where were we? Serious point,
thank you very much. I was there, I was talking
to this builder, a lovely bloke. It turns out he was there because
he had circular sawed though his femur. After a while, we got talking,
and he said,",636.091,19.278,655.369,NA
"""Anyway, enough about me,
what about you? Why are you here?"" Let me tell you, nothing
is more embarrassing in life, than when you look at a bloke who is bleeding through the lower
part of his body and you go, ""Why am I here? Oh, too much coffee!""",657.513,15.134,672.647,NA
"(Laughter) You look like a bit of a 'word
that I am not allowed to say'. It is bizarre. Anorexia is a big problem. It affects people like Kelly Clarkson,
Lily Allen, Victoria Beckham.",672.652,13.927999999999999,686.58,NA
"It is a huge problem. It is responsible
for a lot of rubbish music. (Laughter) Those are famous female anorexics. I asked my housemate if he could
name any famous male anorexics,",686.589,12.458999999999998,699.048,NA
"and he just went, ""Gandhi?"" I said, ""No!"" There is a gap in the market
for the first famous male anorexic. It is not a very big gap. (Laughter)",703.959,12.658999999999999,716.6179999999999,NA
"That is not why I am doing this. I do not want fame or glory.
I am not doing it for that. I do not want to be on television; the camera adds ten pounds,
you can go away. Men are much more likely to get bulimia
as well, that is something I meant to say.",719.51,16.557000000000002,736.067,NA
"Only about 90% of anorexics
that we know of are female. Anywhere between 10% and 25%
are male, and that is on the increase. Men are much more likely to get bulimia so there are a lot of famous
examples of male bulimics; people like Elton John was bulimic.",736.072,18.811,754.883,NA
"So 'Rocket Man'? It is all about salad. It is an incredibly big problem in the UK, and I know that because I am lucky
and honored to work with an incredible charity called, ""Beat"",
the UK's largest eating disorder charity. They gave me an award for the show
and the tour last year,",754.888,18.607999999999997,773.496,NA
"which was wonderful. I have a women there
that manages me called Rebecca, and when we went to the Edinburgh Fringe, I realised as I got on the train, I needed
to send Rebecca at Beat an email. I pulled a pen out of my pocket and wrote
on the back of my hand, ""Beat, Rebecca"".",773.513,17.024,790.537,NA
"You can imagine what the bloke
next to me thought. In his mind, ""This is just some
really lazy domestic abuse."" I was in a really cheeky mood so I just
looked at him and went, ""She deserves it."" Just before Christmas as well, I found
out, I am very lucky and honored, I am the ambassador of a charity
that helps promote the idea",790.542,20.712,811.254,NA
"that men get eating disorders too. They are absolutely wonderful,
I am now their media representative. I do all their TV, radio,
and press interviews. Also, subsequently, there is an interview
with me in a newspaper, I am not allowed to say which one,
but it rhymes with 'The Pluardian'.",812.65,15.972999999999999,828.6229999999999,NA
"(Laughter) I did this interview with them
on male anorexia, something that I feel really strongly
and really seriously about. I did not realise that the media
have coined this phrase, ""Manorexia"". It is just the worst word; ""Manorexia.""",828.631,15.972000000000001,844.603,NA
"It sounds like the world's
worst superhero, right? Like, ""Manorexia and Bulimia Boy
taking on the world, one calorie at a time"". ""Oh no, it is that evil nemesis,
it is Carbohydrate!"" (Laughter)",845.839,13.784,859.623,NA
"Their side-kick; ""Lack-of-Iron Man"". He does not do anything, he just faints. ""In comes Captain Anemia!"" There are loads of them. I am having a ball. What a lot of LOLs.",859.628,14.738,874.366,NA
"Besides all the jokes, besides
all the mucking about, there is a really serious point
that I wanted to leave you with. That is that one in four anorexics
either tries to, or is successful at, taking their own lives. It has the highest mortality rate
of any mental health disease.",878.32,21.887999999999998,900.2080000000001,NA
"People say to me now, ""Are you over it?"" I know this is something that I am going
to have for the rest of my life. But the real question
is, ""Can I deal with it?"" I can deal with it now,
because I can talk about it. I want to talk about it and show
that it is nothing to be ashamed of.",900.213,21.769,921.982,NA
"I want to talk about it
so that we can help sufferers. And I want to talk about it so that we can
get that woman to realise that no, a packet of Monster Munch
is not how you get over anorexia. I just want to say it has been
an absolute pleasure to talk to you. Thank you very much.",923.046,19.451,942.4970000000001,NA
