some of the diagnostic tests you may,3.77,5.829,9.599,fear
encounter when diagnosing diabetes the,6.33,5.189,11.519,fear
first time the first diagnostic test,9.599,3.511,13.11,surprise
that we've noted in this case was a,11.519,4.77,16.289,NA
c-peptide Pro insulin which is produced,13.11,5.16,18.27,NA
by the pancreas is cleaved into insulin,16.289,4.83,21.119,NA
and c-peptide both are then secreted,18.27,4.58,22.85,NA
from the pancreas into the bloodstream,21.119,4.801,25.92,NA
when you see a high level of C peptide,22.85,6.099,28.949,NA
in the in the blood usually this implies,25.92,6.089,32.009,NA
that the body is producing insulin so in,28.949,5.281,34.230000000000004,NA
response to high blood glucose the,32.009,4.261,36.27,NA
pancreas will produce insulin and in,34.23,4.169,38.398999999999994,NA
conjunction with it it will produce the,36.27,6.09,42.36,NA
peptide a low level of C peptide implies,38.399,7.621,46.02,NA
that there is a low or even absent level,42.36,5.85,48.21,NA
of insulin produced by the body and this,46.02,4.23,50.25,surprise
is the type of manifestation that you're,48.21,4.64,52.85,fear
likely to encounter in type 1 diabetes,50.25,5.28,55.53,fear
ketone bodies acetoacetate and,52.85,5.29,58.14,fear
beta-hydroxybutyrate as well as acetone,55.53,5.009,60.539,fear
are the hallmarks of the metabolic,58.14,5.55,63.69,fear
acidosis that is encountered in usually,60.539,5.131,65.67,fear
type 1 but also potentially in type 2,63.69,4.499,68.189,fear
diabetes when you see these ketone,65.67,4.949,70.619,fear
bodies in the urine and more alarmingly,68.189,4.68,72.869,fear
in the blood stream this usually implies,70.619,3.901,74.52,fear
that the patient has a metabolic,72.869,4.171,77.04,fear
acidosis due to the production of excess,74.52,5.16,79.67999999999999,fear
ketone bodies it also implies a,77.04,5.7,82.74000000000001,surprise
decreased insulin State and is actually,79.68,5.52,85.2,surprise
one of the Emergencies associated with,82.74,4.29,87.03,fear
diabetes mellitus that we will discuss a,85.2,5.82,91.02000000000001,fear
little bit later in the lecture finally,87.03,6.06,93.09,fear
some of the auto antibodies we mentioned,91.02,5.809,96.829,fear
in the immune forms of type 1 diabetes a,93.09,7.95,101.04,fear
gad65 and an ia 2 antibody can sometimes,96.829,6.04,102.869,fear
also be used for confirmation of the,101.04,3.439,104.47900000000001,happy
diagnosis of type 1 diabetes,102.869,5.061,107.93,happy
interestingly enough antibodies to gad65,104.479,6.521,111.0,fear
persists longer than those of two islet,107.93,5.829,113.759,fear
cells in the case of ia 2 after the,111.0,5.189,116.189,fear
development of diabetes and may be a,113.759,5.79,119.549,fear
better test to diagnose immune related,116.189,7.981,124.16999999999999,fear
type 1 diabetes in type 1 diabetes you,119.549,6.241,125.79,fear
usually see this in the setting of,124.17,3.289,127.459,fear
insulin deficiency,125.79,4.8,130.59,fear
about 5% of the diagnosis of diabetes,127.459,4.841,132.3,fear
are associated with type 1,130.59,4.41,135.0,fear
diabetes underlying mechanisms are,132.3,4.23,136.53,fear
destruction of insulin producing,135.0,4.41,139.41,fear
pancreatic beta-cells and clinical,136.53,4.47,141.0,fear
manifestations we can usually at around,139.41,5.07,144.48,fear
80 to 90 percent destruction these as,141.0,5.76,146.76,fear
mentioned can be autoimmune or immune,144.48,5.07,149.54999999999998,fear
mediated they can be idiopathic or they,146.76,4.56,151.32,fear
can be acquired from infiltrative,149.55,4.7,154.25,fear
conditions such as hemochromatosis,151.32,5.07,156.39,fear
typically it affects children and,154.25,4.42,158.67,fear
adolescents in the age range of five to,156.39,4.8,161.19,fear
fifteen there is an image that,158.67,4.71,163.38,fear
accompanies the slide that shows a young,161.19,4.32,165.51,fear
girl with the manifestations of,163.38,5.28,168.66,NA
dehydration you can see her eyes sunken,165.51,3.93,169.44,NA
inner orbits,168.66,4.02,172.68,NA
she has pallor she's wasted and thin,169.44,5.31,174.75,NA
which is a feature of her type 1,172.68,4.65,177.33,NA
diabetes and if you look closely at her,174.75,4.71,179.46,NA
rib cage you can see that the clinical,177.33,4.71,182.04000000000002,happy
sign of intercostal recession this is,179.46,5.97,185.43,surprise
usually manifested by children who have,182.04,5.82,187.85999999999999,fear
respiratory distress so in the setting,185.43,3.99,189.42000000000002,fear
of this constellation of clinical,187.86,3.66,191.52,fear
findings one would want to work up this,189.42,3.75,193.17,NA
patient for the presence of diabetic,191.52,5.939,197.459,fear
ketoacidosis autoimmune mediated type 1,193.17,5.97,199.14,fear
diabetes is usually a disease of,197.459,4.201,201.66,angry
children and young than adults but it,199.14,5.31,204.45,angry
can occur at any age or body mass index,201.66,5.76,207.42,angry

from minor elevations in glucose levels,207.42,5.85,213.26999999999998,angry
to diabetic ketoacidosis beta cell,209.61,6.21,215.82000000000002,angry
destruction varies it is frequently more,213.27,4.58,217.85000000000002,NA
rapid in children compared to adults,215.82,4.56,220.38,NA
some patients with absolute incident,217.85,5.109,222.959,NA
insulin deficiency have no evidence of,220.38,4.53,224.91,NA
autoimmunity and have no other known,222.959,4.5,227.459,NA
cause for beta cell destruction this is,224.91,5.13,230.04,NA
quite rare and when this occurs these,227.459,4.561,232.02,NA
patients are said to have idiopathic or,230.04,6.35,236.39,NA
