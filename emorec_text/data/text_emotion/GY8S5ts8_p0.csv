[Music] some of the diagnostic tests you may encounter when diagnosing diabetes the first time the first diagnostic test that we've noted in this case was a,0.65,24.979,25.628999999999998,angry
c-peptide Pro insulin which is produced by the pancreas is cleaved into insulin and c-peptide both are then secreted from the pancreas into the bloodstream when you see a high level of C peptide,13.11,25.470000000000002,38.58,NA
in the in the blood usually this implies that the body is producing insulin so in response to high blood glucose the pancreas will produce insulin and in conjunction with it it will produce the,25.92,25.89,51.81,angry
peptide a low level of C peptide implies that there is a low or even absent level of insulin produced by the body and this is the type of manifestation that you're likely to encounter in type 1 diabetes,38.399,27.621000000000002,66.02000000000001,angry
ketone bodies acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate as well as acetone are the hallmarks of the metabolic acidosis that is encountered in usually type 1 but also potentially in type 2,52.85,25.479,78.32900000000001,angry
diabetes when you see these ketone bodies in the urine and more alarmingly in the blood stream this usually implies that the patient has a metabolic acidosis due to the production of excess,65.67,22.861,88.531,angry
ketone bodies it also implies a decreased insulin State and is actually one of the Emergencies associated with diabetes mellitus that we will discuss a little bit later in the lecture finally,77.04,27.389999999999997,104.43,angry
some of the auto antibodies we mentioned in the immune forms of type 1 diabetes a gad65 and an ia 2 antibody can sometimes also be used for confirmation of the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes,91.02,28.299,119.31899999999999,angry
interestingly enough antibodies to gad65 persists longer than those of two islet cells in the case of ia 2 after the development of diabetes and may be a better test to diagnose immune related,104.479,31.310000000000002,135.789,angry
type 1 diabetes in type 1 diabetes you usually see this in the setting of insulin deficiency about 5% of the diagnosis of diabetes are associated with type 1,119.549,23.581,143.13,angry
diabetes underlying mechanisms are destruction of insulin producing pancreatic beta-cells and clinical manifestations we can usually at around 80 to 90 percent destruction these as,132.3,23.939999999999998,156.24,angry
mentioned can be autoimmune or immune mediated they can be idiopathic or they can be acquired from infiltrative conditions such as hemochromatosis typically it affects children and,144.48,23.82,168.29999999999998,angry
adolescents in the age range of five to fifteen there is an image that accompanies the slide that shows a young girl with the manifestations of dehydration you can see her eyes sunken,156.39,23.04,179.42999999999998,angry
inner orbits she has pallor she's wasted and thin which is a feature of her type 1 diabetes and if you look closely at her rib cage you can see that the clinical,168.66,23.4,192.06,angry
sign of intercostal recession this is usually manifested by children who have respiratory distress so in the setting of this constellation of clinical findings one would want to work up this,179.46,23.189999999999998,202.65,angry
patient for the presence of diabetic ketoacidosis autoimmune mediated type 1 diabetes is usually a disease of children and young than adults but it can occur at any age or body mass index,191.52,27.18,218.70000000000002,angry
range the initial presentation ranges from minor elevations in glucose levels to diabetic ketoacidosis beta cell destruction varies it is frequently more rapid in children compared to adults,204.45,26.359999999999996,230.80999999999997,angry
some patients with absolute incident insulin deficiency have no evidence of autoimmunity and have no other known cause for beta cell destruction this is quite rare and when this occurs these,217.85,23.83,241.68,NA
patients are said to have idiopathic or type 1 relieved diabetes mellitus [Music],230.04,25.15,255.19,NA
