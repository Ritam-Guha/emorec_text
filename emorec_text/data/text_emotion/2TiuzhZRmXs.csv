[Music] hello this is dr daniel cotton and today i want to talk about gastroparesis most patients don't understand what,0.0,17.591,17.591,angry
gastroparesis is even though they've got this diagnosis from either their gastroenterologist or their primary care physician today we want to go through,10.88,17.119,27.999000000000002,angry
gastroparesis talk about its etiology and what causes the symptoms that you're facing and then in subsequent videos we're going to talk about,18.96,20.720000000000002,39.68000000000001,angry
how we as surgeons treat gastroparesis to relieve those symptoms in a logical way what i've done now is i've just done a simple diagram on the stomach,29.119,19.521,48.64,angry
and when we look at the stomach it's divided into four parts we have the fundus the body the antrum and the pylorus and what the basic problem is in gastroparesis,39.52,20.560000000000002,60.080000000000005,angry
is the muscles of the body the stomach and the fundus go bad and this is the earliest thing that happens to people when they start notice that they can't digest their food,49.2,20.16,69.36,angry
normally or have chronic abdominal pain when they get the diagnosis of gastroparesis is this is what's going on and when we want to label how this goes bad it's first the fundus,59.6,19.759999999999998,79.36,angry
is the first part to go bad the body is the second part to go back the third part is actually the pylorus which is the valve at the end of the stomach,69.76,18.64,88.4,NA
and the fourth part and last to go bad is actually the antro and when we start to think about the symptoms of gastroparesis they all start with the paralyzed,78.4,20.718999999999998,99.119,NA
stomach and i've labeled that the first problem of gastroparesis the second problem comes from that issue and that is the fact that we get rotten fruit,89.439,21.521,110.96,angry
in the stomach as a result of the paralyzed stomach that rotten food makes patients feel very bad and makes them feel sick all the time,100.0,15.04,115.03999999999999,angry
and when they feel sick all the time that's why they don't feel good all day long is because they're constantly nauseated because,107.84,14.72,122.56,NA
you have rotten food sitting in your stomach and how could you feel good with rotten foods when you're stuck the third part and i said goes bad third is the pylorus,114.88,22.718,137.59799999999998,NA
now the polaris is a circular valve at the end of the stomach it's primarily there to control the blood sugar levels in your body and the interesting thing about this is,126.159,22.402,148.561,angry
when the paralysis gradually goes down the stomach what happens when the pylorus gets paralyzed instead of opening up it constricts down,137.44,20.879,158.319,angry
and i like to liken this to when you see a person who's handicapped and their arm is gone and spasm like this it's because they've been paralyzed in,147.52,19.361,166.881,angry
such a way that their tricep and the back arm can't straighten so their bicep innervation is retained and it just contracts in and so what happens with this pylorus,157.68,19.28,176.96,angry
when it goes bad it spasms itself down and tell nothing can go past it so i want to illustrate you what happens if you have gastroparesis and you're vomiting so,167.36,27.200000000000003,194.56,NA
the antrum like i said is the last to go bad so this pylorus spasms down and it spasms down so it's all closed or almost all closed and so the antrum,180.8,22.88,203.68,NA
still has some ability to squeeze because it's the last place to lose its innovation so all it does is it squeezes the food against the pylorus which then injects it up the esophagus,192.08,22.159000000000002,214.239,NA
because it has nowhere to go so when you talk about the symptoms of gastroparesis we're talking about symptoms from rotten food and pylor spasm,203.519,20.121,223.64000000000001,NA
and when we talk about the treatment for gastroparesis we have to find a way to treat number one the symptoms of rotten food and polar spasm,213.2,18.28,231.48,NA
and we have to find a way to deal with the paralyzed stomach to allow the food to go through without causing nausea and food retention and so our subsequent,222.48,19.68,242.16,NA
videos after we have this short introduction are going to deal with the ways that we deal with these issues the issue of the rotten through the bylaw spasm,233.04,19.2,252.23999999999998,NA
and the paralyzed stomach they often have symptoms due to their colon and that's what i label other so the same problem that's causing their,242.0,16.56,258.56,angry
stomach to lose its ability to contract happens in their colon and so oftentimes gastroparesis patients will suffer from chronic very severe constipation,250.0,19.599,269.599,angry
and so in order to talk about dealing with the whole gastroparesis patient so many people want to throw drugs at them but the actual truth is what we need to talk about is treating their,259.919,17.761,277.68,NA
whole gastrointestinal system in order to get them in a place so they can actually function in daily life without being in chronic,269.6,16.4,286.0,NA
pain and chronic constipation so these are the things which we need to deal with whenever we talk about them we're the only people that do this in the state of,277.84,16.079,293.919,NA
utah and most of the state surrounded we've seen large amounts of success with these patients and we'd love to do a consult either in,285.84,16.481,302.32099999999997,NA
person or via telemedicine thanks for tuning in have a good day,294.0,15.84,309.84,NA
