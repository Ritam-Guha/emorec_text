hello,3.439,3.36,6.7989999999999995,
this is dr daniel cotton and today i,4.48,4.64,9.120000000000001,happy
want to talk about gastroparesis,6.799,4.081,10.88,happy
most patients don't understand what,9.12,3.28,12.399999999999999,fear
gastroparesis is,10.88,3.2,14.080000000000002,fear
even though they've got this diagnosis,12.4,3.76,16.16,sad
from either their gastroenterologist or,14.08,3.76,17.84,sad
their primary care physician,16.16,2.8,18.96,sad
today we want to go through,17.84,3.599,21.439,sad
gastroparesis talk about its,18.96,6.159,25.119,sad
etiology and what causes the symptoms,21.439,4.641,26.08,sad
that you're facing,25.119,2.881,28.0,sad
and then in subsequent videos we're,26.08,3.039,29.119,sad
going to talk about,28.0,4.0,32.0,sad
how we as surgeons treat gastroparesis,29.119,4.401,33.519999999999996,sad
to relieve those symptoms,32.0,4.64,36.64,sad
in a logical way what i've done now is,33.52,5.12,38.64,sad
i've just done a simple diagram on the,36.64,2.88,39.52,fear
stomach,38.64,2.48,41.12,fear
and when we look at the stomach it's,39.52,3.44,42.96,fear
divided into four parts we have the,41.12,2.959,44.079,
fundus the body,42.96,3.919,46.879,
the antrum and the pylorus and what the,44.079,5.121,49.2,fear
basic problem is in gastroparesis,46.879,5.121,52.0,sad
is the muscles of the body the stomach,49.2,3.92,53.120000000000005,sad
and the fundus,52.0,3.92,55.92,sad
go bad and this is the earliest thing,53.12,4.4,57.519999999999996,sad
that happens to people when they start,55.92,3.68,59.6,sad
notice that they can't digest their food,57.52,4.24,61.760000000000005,fear
normally or have chronic abdominal pain,59.6,3.52,63.120000000000005,sad
when they get the diagnosis of,61.76,3.759,65.51899999999999,sad
gastroparesis is this is what's going on,63.12,3.84,66.96,
and when we want to label,65.519,4.241,69.76,
how this goes bad it's first the fundus,66.96,4.4,71.36,
is the first part to go bad,69.76,4.24,74.0,
the body is the second part to go back,71.36,4.799,76.159,
the third part is actually the pylorus,74.0,3.52,77.52,
which is the valve at the end of the,76.159,2.241,78.4,
stomach,77.52,3.84,81.36,
and the fourth part and last to go bad,78.4,5.2,83.60000000000001,
is actually the antro,81.36,4.32,85.68,
and when we start to think about the,83.6,4.24,87.83999999999999,
symptoms of gastroparesis,85.68,3.759,89.43900000000001,
they all start with the paralyzed,87.84,3.2,91.04,
stomach and i've labeled that the first,89.439,3.36,92.79899999999999,
problem of gastroparesis,91.04,5.2,96.24000000000001,
the second problem comes from that issue,92.799,6.561,99.36000000000001,
and that is the fact that we get rotten,96.24,3.76,100.0,
fruit,99.36,2.64,102.0,
in the stomach as a result of the,100.0,3.28,103.28,
paralyzed stomach,102.0,3.04,105.04,
that rotten food makes patients feel,103.28,3.92,107.2,
very bad and makes them feel sick all,105.04,2.8,107.84,
the time,107.2,2.0,109.2,
and when they feel sick all the time,107.84,3.279,111.119,
that's why they don't feel good all day,109.2,2.64,111.84,
long,111.119,3.201,114.32,
is because they're constantly nauseated,111.84,3.04,114.88000000000001,
because,114.32,2.56,116.88,
you have rotten food sitting in your,114.88,3.919,118.79899999999999,
stomach and how could you feel good with,116.88,2.72,119.6,
rotten foods,118.799,4.32,123.119,
when you're stuck the third part,119.6,6.559,126.15899999999999,
and i said goes bad third is the pylorus,123.119,5.2,128.319,
now the polaris is a circular valve at,126.159,4.561,130.72,
the end of the stomach it's primarily,128.319,5.681,134.0,
there to control the blood sugar levels,130.72,4.48,135.2,
in your body,134.0,3.44,137.44,
and the interesting thing about this is,135.2,4.24,139.44,
when the paralysis gradually goes down,137.44,2.96,140.4,
the stomach,139.44,3.76,143.2,
what happens when the pylorus gets,140.4,3.68,144.08,
paralyzed,143.2,4.32,147.51999999999998,
instead of opening up it constricts down,144.08,6.159,150.239,
and i like to liken this to when you see,147.52,4.48,152.0,
a person who's handicapped,150.239,4.801,155.04,
and their arm is gone and spasm like,152.0,3.599,155.599,
this,155.04,2.64,157.67999999999998,
it's because they've been paralyzed in,155.599,3.841,159.44,
such a way that their tricep and the,157.68,3.279,160.959,
back arm can't straighten,159.44,4.4,163.84,
so their bicep innervation is retained,160.959,4.56,165.519,
and it just contracts in,163.84,3.52,167.36,
and so what happens with this pylorus,165.519,3.521,169.04,
when it goes bad,167.36,5.12,172.48000000000002,
it spasms itself down and tell,169.04,6.0,175.04,
nothing can go past it so i want to,172.48,4.96,177.44,
illustrate you what happens if you have,175.04,5.76,180.79999999999998,
gastroparesis and you're vomiting so,177.44,5.36,182.8,
the antrum like i said is the last to go,180.8,3.84,184.64000000000001,
bad so this pylorus,182.8,5.359,188.15900000000002,
spasms down and it spasms down so it's,184.64,4.879,189.51899999999998,
all closed,188.159,3.921,192.07999999999998,
or almost all closed and so the antrum,189.519,4.881,194.4,
still has some ability to squeeze,192.08,3.68,195.76000000000002,
because it's the last place,194.4,3.839,198.239,
to lose its innovation so all it does is,195.76,5.04,200.79999999999998,
it squeezes the food against the pylorus,198.239,5.28,203.519,
which then injects it up the esophagus,200.8,4.32,205.12,
because it has nowhere to go,203.519,3.201,206.72,fear
so when you talk about the symptoms of,205.12,3.52,208.64000000000001,
gastroparesis we're talking about,206.72,3.04,209.76,
symptoms from,208.64,4.56,213.2,
rotten food and pylor spasm,209.76,5.8,215.56,
and when we talk about the treatment for,213.2,3.52,216.72,
gastroparesis,215.56,3.64,219.2,
we have to find a way to treat number,216.72,4.48,221.2,
one the symptoms of rotten food and,219.2,3.28,222.48,
polar spasm,221.2,3.36,224.56,
and we have to find a way to deal with,222.48,3.52,226.0,
the paralyzed stomach,224.56,4.08,228.64000000000001,
to allow the food to go through without,226.0,4.08,230.08,
causing nausea,228.64,4.4,233.04,
and food retention and so our subsequent,230.08,3.6,233.68,
videos,233.04,2.32,235.35999999999999,
after we have this short introduction,233.68,3.6,237.28,
are going to deal with the ways that we,235.36,4.799,240.15900000000002,
deal with these issues the issue of the,237.28,4.72,242.0,
rotten through the bylaw spasm,240.159,3.761,243.92,
and the paralyzed stomach they often,242.0,3.2,245.2,
have symptoms due to,243.92,3.12,247.04,
their colon and that's what i label,245.2,3.039,248.23899999999998,
other so,247.04,2.96,250.0,
the same problem that's causing their,248.239,4.241,252.48000000000002,sad
stomach to lose its ability to contract,250.0,5.04,255.04,fear
happens in their colon and so oftentimes,252.48,4.24,256.71999999999997,fear
gastroparesis patients,255.04,3.759,258.799,fear
will suffer from chronic very severe,256.72,3.199,259.91900000000004,fear
constipation,258.799,3.361,262.15999999999997,
and so in order to talk about dealing,259.919,4.401,264.32,
with the whole gastroparesis patient,262.16,4.0,266.16,sad
so many people want to throw drugs at,264.32,3.76,268.08,sad
them but the actual truth is what we,266.16,3.44,269.6,fear
need to talk about is treating their,268.08,2.16,270.24,sad
whole,269.6,3.36,272.96000000000004,sad
gastrointestinal system in order to get,270.24,3.28,273.52,sad
them,272.96,3.12,276.08,sad
in a place so they can actually function,273.52,4.32,277.84,fear
in daily life without being in chronic,276.08,2.32,278.4,fear
pain,277.84,2.56,280.4,
and chronic constipation so these are,278.4,3.68,282.08,
the things which we need to deal with,280.4,3.68,284.08,
whenever we talk about them we're the,282.08,3.76,285.84,
only people that do this in the state of,284.08,2.399,286.479,sad
utah,285.84,3.04,288.88,sad
and most of the state surrounded we've,286.479,3.44,289.919,sad
seen large,288.88,3.12,292.0,sad
amounts of success with these patients,289.919,4.081,294.0,sad
and we'd love to do a consult either in,292.0,2.8,294.8,sad
person,294.0,3.6,297.6,sad
or via telemedicine thanks for tuning in,294.8,7.52,302.32,
have a good day,297.6,4.72,302.32000000000005,
