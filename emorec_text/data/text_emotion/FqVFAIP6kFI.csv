hey guys in this video we're gonna talk,0.03,3.72,3.75,
about another part of the nervous system,1.829,4.891,6.72,
that gets affected with high blood,3.75,6.63,10.379999999999999,
glucose or high insulin okay in other,6.72,5.22,11.94,
videos I've talked about the damage to,10.38,4.02,14.4,
the brain your memory your cognitive,11.94,4.199,16.139,
function I talked about peripheral,14.4,3.959,18.359,
neuropathy which is damage to the nerves,16.139,5.011,21.15,
in the hands and the feet because high,18.359,4.441,22.8,
levels of insulin and high levels of,21.15,4.5,25.65,
sugar destroy the blood vessels that go,22.8,4.08,26.880000000000003,
to the nerves,25.65,3.24,28.89,
but the autonomic nervous system is,26.88,3.479,30.358999999999998,
another part of the nervous system that,28.89,4.38,33.27,
is not commonly talked about okay,30.359,5.011,35.370000000000005,
the autonomic nervous system is composed,33.27,4.53,37.800000000000004,
of three different sections you have the,35.37,3.599,38.968999999999994,fear
sympathetic nerves which is the,37.8,1.77,39.57,fear
flight-or-fight,38.969,3.481,42.45,fear
you have the parasympathetic nervous,39.57,5.37,44.94,
system which is responsible for rest and,42.45,5.67,48.120000000000005,
digest and recovering from stress and,44.94,4.86,49.8,
then you also have the part which is,48.12,3.36,51.48,
called the enteric which is all the,49.8,3.39,53.19,
digestion so the autonomic nervous,51.48,4.62,56.099999999999994,
system is that system that works below,53.19,4.65,57.839999999999996,
your conscious awareness,56.1,4.38,60.480000000000004,
it works on automatic so when you have a,57.84,5.28,63.120000000000005,
neuropathy nerve damage of this system,60.48,4.819,65.29899999999999,
you can have a problem with the bladder,63.12,5.19,68.31,
retention lack of control where you have,65.299,6.07,71.369,
to wear a diaper leaky valves your,68.31,5.07,73.38,
genitals could be also affected in,71.369,4.5,75.869,
potency you can't get an erection you,73.38,5.61,78.99,
don't have a libido anymore digestion,75.869,5.131,81.0,
there's a condition called gastroparesis,78.99,4.169,83.15899999999999,
where your stomach just doesn't empty,81.0,5.04,86.04,
very fast so everything is very slow of,83.159,4.591,87.75,
course if you have a slow digestive,86.04,3.57,89.61,
system you're going to end up having,87.75,4.049,91.799,
constipation because you're not getting,89.61,4.32,93.93,
the full digestion and then you're gonna,91.799,4.081,95.88000000000001,
have problems with the heart blood,93.93,4.92,98.85000000000001,
pressure either high or low pulse rate,95.88,6.239,102.119,
either high or low or rhythm problems,98.85,5.58,104.42999999999999,fear
like atrial fibrillation or heart,102.119,4.5,106.619,
palpitations you can also have problems,104.43,5.82,110.25,
with breathing in oxygen exchange as in,106.619,6.901,113.52,
sleep apnea so the consequence of high,110.25,5.46,115.71,
sugar and high insulin on the nervous,113.52,5.129,118.649,
system is quite extensive but the good,115.71,4.799,120.509,
news about this is that if you can,118.649,3.781,122.43,
control the sugar and you can lower the,120.509,4.5,125.009,
insulin you can heal some of these,122.43,5.13,127.56,
disorders I'm seeing this happen all,125.009,4.321,129.33,fear
over the place when you put people on a,127.56,3.929,131.489,fear
healthy ketogenic diet and in the minute,129.33,3.57,132.9,neutral
fasting you,131.489,3.271,134.76,
see amazing things clear up that you,132.9,3.929,136.829,
wouldn't necessarily think could clear,134.76,2.46,137.22,
up,136.829,3.36,140.18900000000002,
you see bladder and prevent improvements,137.22,5.879,143.099,
with the sex organs great improvements,140.189,5.731,145.92,
with digestion cardiovascular and the,143.099,5.851,148.95,
quality of sleep so just because you,145.92,4.86,150.78,
have these conditions does not mean it's,148.95,4.08,153.03,
permanent so I put a link down below for,150.78,4.2,154.98,
those of you that are new to this you,153.03,3.9,156.93,fear
definitely need to look into the area of,154.98,5.49,160.47,
keto and in a min the fasting hey if you,156.93,6.419,163.34900000000002,
