"Hey everybody it's Doctor Jo, and today
I'm going to show you the top five ways to relieve pain for peripheral
neuropathy and other foot ailments. So let's get started. One, calf stretches. For the calf stretch,
you can use a strap, a stretching strap, you can use a belt, if you have dog you
can use a dog leash, or just a big towel,",0.03,25.439999999999998,25.47,angry
"but I like the ones that have the loops
in them because you want to just place it it kind of around the ball of your
foot. With a calf stretch, you want your leg to be straight so bent like this
isn't going to quite stretch the calf, so if you want to do it sitting down you
can. I have a whole bunch of different ways to stretch it, and you can check
that video out, but just sitting in a",25.47,19.29,44.76,angry
"chair bring your leg up so it's straight,
and pull with the strap. So you want your foot to be relaxed, and then just pull
until you feel a stretch through that calf area. You're going to hold that
stretch for about 30 seconds and then relax it. Take just a little quick
10-second break, and then stretch again. So you're going to do that a total of
three times for 30 seconds. Number two.",44.76,24.679,69.439,angry
"Far infrared heat. Ohh! The folks at
thermotex partnered up with us, and they sent us their platinum thermotex,
and this far infrared heat is super cool because what it does is it goes deeper.
It penetrates deeper into the body. So usually with a normal heating pad, it
only goes may be 0.25 centimeters this one goes all the way up to 6 centimeters
or 2.36",69.439,26.531,95.97,angry
"inches. So it goes down deeper in there,
it doesn't dry out the skin, it doesn't dehydrate you, and it uses light instead
of heat so this is really really cool. And I like the Platinum a lot because
this one is very versatile, you can use it kind of for any part of your body. It
has the three heat plates here, so it really molds around everything. And I
like it for the foot, and especially for",95.97,29.189,125.15899999999999,NA
"peripheral neuropathy, diabetic
neuropathy, but you can also use it for plantar fasciitis, hammer toes, fallen
arches, just arthritis in general, or even sprains and strains
down here. So you put your foot on the middle footplate there, and then you can
just bring this up almost like a ""C"" around the foot. It doesn't necessarily
have to be super tight because it",125.159,21.961000000000002,147.12,NA
"penetrates so deeply that you can just
put it loosely around your foot, and so the Platinum you can see here has a lot
of ways you can use it. If you're interested in finding out more about the
Platinum, you can check out my full review of the platinum by clicking the

"well. Also if you want to be more
specific with the foot, they have a little foot covering here which is
really nice, and I like this because not only is it cute, but you can stick your
feet in like this and it kind of encases the feet, so you can do them both at the
same time. And again you can just have it and be working on something or watching
TV, and it is cool because if you have",164.55,28.19,192.74,angry
"peripheral neuropathy, or some kind of
other nerve issue where you don't really have sensation in your feet, there's a
pad in here that you can add in so it doesn't get that heat quite directly on
there since you can't feel it. So you can use it all the time in there if you want
to, but if you want a little bit more heat that you can feel, you can take this
out while you're using it. And I have",192.74,21.880000000000003,214.62,NA

my feet are cold all the time, and so I like this just to have on my feet to
keep that circulation going especially when it's cold outside it makes it
really nice, and if you're interested in purchasing the product you can go to

Number three. Ankle pumps. For ankle pumps,",214.62,25.53,240.15,angry
"you just want to put your foot out. If
you want to prop it up on something you can, but make sure that your heel is free
moving so it's not actually on the thing that's propped up, or you can just stick
your foot out like me, and then you're just going to pull up and push down, so
just pumping that ankle helps increase that circulation to the area and works
those muscles, so just start off with",240.15,23.099999999999998,263.25,angry

these and you can work your way up to 20 to 25 really pushing down as far as you
can and pulling up. Number four. Heel toe raises. For seated heel toe raises, just
place your feet flat on the ground, and then come up on your toes, come down and,

you start off you have something sturdy like a countertop or a sturdy chair. Hold

with a finger on each side, and then if that becomes easy, then just one finger,
