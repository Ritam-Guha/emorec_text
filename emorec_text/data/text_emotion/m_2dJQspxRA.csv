good morning today we will be learning,1.62,5.439,7.059,fear
about what is hemoglobin a1c which is a,4.09,5.82,9.91,happy
diabetes test so you have diabetes you,7.059,5.041,12.100000000000001,sad
go to a doctor or you have your dad,9.91,3.96,13.870000000000001,sad
grandmom you take them to the doctor and,12.1,2.97,15.07,fear
the doctors like what have you been,13.87,3.419,17.288999999999998,fear
doing your a1c is way out of control,15.07,4.23,19.3,fear
your diabetes is way out of control,17.289,4.201,21.490000000000002,fear
and you're like oh my god the past two,19.3,3.6,22.900000000000002,sad
weeks have been following a strict,21.49,3.66,25.15,sad
diabetic diet and my sugars are all have,22.9,4.08,26.979999999999997,sad
been perfect then why's the doctor,25.15,3.99,29.14,sad
saying my diabetes is out of control,26.98,3.93,30.91,sad
so to understand that let's know what,29.14,6.21,35.35,fear
the hemoglobin a1c is so we all have,30.91,6.21,37.12,fear
little cells called red blood cells in,35.35,3.479,38.829,fear
our body which contain a substance,37.12,4.379,41.498999999999995,fear
called hemoglobin the work of this,38.829,4.5,43.329,fear
hemoglobin is when you breathe in oxygen,41.499,4.261,45.760000000000005,fear
to attach to the oxygen and take oxygen,43.329,5.46,48.789,fear
to different cells and supply oxygen to,45.76,6.419,52.178999999999995,fear
different cells so as our brain cells,48.789,6.62,55.409,fear
the red blood cells also thrive on,52.179,6.81,58.989000000000004,fear
glucose so the only form of energy for,55.409,6.011,61.42,fear
your red blood cells as blood glucose so,58.989,4.56,63.549,fear
whenever there's glucose in the blood,61.42,4.56,65.98,neutral
the RBC kind of is exposed to it or,63.549,5.161,68.71,sad
takes a part of it and kind of stores in,65.98,5.37,71.35000000000001,fear
it because that's its form of energy and,68.71,6.27,74.97999999999999,fear
the RBC or your red blood cell lives 90,71.35,6.48,77.83,fear
days or three months so when we do the,74.98,5.76,80.74000000000001,fear
hemoglobin a1c test we are checking the,77.83,6.36,84.19,fear
glucose in the RBC so that will give us,80.74,6.45,87.19,fear
a range of how your blood sugar has been,84.19,6.53,90.72,fear
in the past three months rather than an,87.19,6.03,93.22,neutral
instantaneous value which is your blood,90.72,5.29,96.01,fear
glucose so to give an example this is,93.22,5.4,98.62,fear
like instead of asking you like what is,96.01,4.47,100.48,fear
your fasting blood sugar yesterday or,98.62,3.6,102.22,fear
what did you have for dinner that's kind,100.48,4.11,104.59,neutral
of like an instantaneous value but,102.22,4.439,106.65899999999999,fear
instead of that asking someone who has,104.59,3.66,108.25,fear
been with you over the past three months,106.659,3.691,110.35000000000001,fear
like your spouse or someone else and,108.25,4.77,113.02,neutral
have been silently watching you munch,110.35,4.74,115.08999999999999,neutral
all these sugary stuff and kind of,113.02,4.889,117.90899999999999,fear
making a note and asking them about how,115.09,4.74,119.83,fear
your diabetic diet has been over the,117.909,3.721,121.63000000000001,fear
past three months so kind of think like,119.83,4.29,124.12,fear
your red blood cell is the silent,121.63,3.9,125.53,fear
spectator in your blood,124.12,3.45,127.57000000000001,fear
who's been watching your blood glucose,125.53,5.519,131.049,fear
trends even when you are not realizing,127.57,5.64,133.20999999999998,fear
and that's what we are checking to kind,131.049,4.891,135.94,fear
you know how your blood sugar range has,133.21,5.13,138.34,fear
been over the past three months rather,135.94,7.26,143.2,fear
than one instantaneous value so to give,138.34,6.06,144.4,neutral
you some noms,143.2,3.48,146.67999999999998,neutral
a normal hemoglobin a1c is somewhere,144.4,4.59,148.99,neutral
between like four and five point six,146.68,4.5,151.18,fear
when you're in the five point seven to,148.99,5.07,154.06,fear
six point four range you are a,151.18,5.07,156.25,fear
pre-diabetic meaning you have a very,154.06,4.62,158.68,happy
high risk of developing diabetes and,156.25,5.34,161.59,neutral
when you're over six point five or,158.68,5.34,164.02,neutral
higher then you are actually a diabetic,161.59,5.28,166.87,fear
and when you have diabetes we'll have,164.02,6.09,170.11,fear
targets for the a1c meaning it depends,166.87,5.88,172.75,fear
mostly on your age and your other risk,170.11,5.07,175.18,fear
factors but predominantly we try to,172.75,4.23,176.98,fear
reach a goal of seven to seven point,175.18,4.89,180.07,fear
five or lower and that kind of gives a,176.98,6.33,183.31,fear
good diabetes control so here is a chart,180.07,8.13,188.2,fear
where it shows like the range of blood,183.31,7.83,191.14000000000001,fear
sugar over three months and expected a1c,188.2,5.55,193.75,fear
values meaning if your Sugar's have been,191.14,4.92,196.05999999999997,fear
in the 150s this is your a1c if your,193.75,4.02,197.77,fear
sugars have predominantly been in the,196.06,4.8,200.86,fear
260s this is your a1c so that's where,197.77,5.1,202.87,fear
this test is a really valuable test,200.86,3.66,204.52,sad
because it kind of gives a range rather,202.87,4.29,207.16,fear
than an instantaneous value but are two,204.52,4.02,208.54000000000002,fear
things that I would like to discuss,207.16,3.99,211.15,fear
which can affect your hemoglobin a1c so,208.54,5.76,214.29999999999998,fear
one is like if you're binging at times,211.15,5.13,216.28,neutral
like during festival days during,214.3,4.02,218.32000000000002,neutral
holidays and then you're just fasting,216.28,3.51,219.79,fear
before coming to your doctor your,218.32,2.88,221.2,fear
fasting blood Sugar's over two weeks,219.79,3.81,223.6,fear
might be perfect but your a1c is still,221.2,3.99,225.19,neutral
going to be high because of all those,223.6,3.9,227.5,fear
binge days when you're silent spectator,225.19,4.62,229.81,fear
has been watching you and the other,227.5,5.94,233.44,fear
thing is if you're maybe like having,229.81,7.08,236.89000000000001,fear
really light meals for breakfast and,233.44,5.19,238.63,fear
lunch and you're just checking your,236.89,3.51,240.39999999999998,fear
blood Sugar's then and then you're,238.63,3.69,242.32,neutral
binging your dinner and you're not,240.4,3.81,244.21,neutral
checking your blood sugar then again,242.32,3.96,246.28,fear
your silent spectator is watching and,244.21,4.56,248.77,fear
when we check your a1c we are going to,246.28,6.06,252.34,fear
know about that so that's why this test,248.77,6.36,255.13000000000002,neutral
is important and it really helps in the,252.34,5.1,257.44,neutral
management of diabetic patients thank,255.13,4.46,259.59,neutral
you,257.44,2.15,259.59,neutral
