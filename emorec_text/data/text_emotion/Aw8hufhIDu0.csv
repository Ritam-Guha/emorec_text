"""What Causes Insulin Resistance?"" Studies dating back nearly a century
noted a striking finding. If you take young, healthy people
and split them up into two groups, half on a fat-rich diet, and the
other half on a carb rich diet, within just two days,
this is what happens.",0.0,20.610000000000003,20.610000000000003,angry
"The glucose intolerance
skyrockets in the fatty diet group. In response to the same
sugar water challenge, the group that had
been shoveling in fat ended up with twice
the blood sugar. As the amount of fat in the diet goes
up, so does one’s blood sugar spikes.",20.61,18.179,38.789,angry
"It would take scientists nearly seven
decades to unravel this mystery, but it would end up holding the key to
our current understanding of the cause of type 2 diabetes. When athletes carb load before a
race, they’re trying to build up the fuel supply
within their muscles.",38.789,16.89,55.679,angry
"They break down the starch into
glucose in their digestive tract; it circulates as blood
glucose, blood sugar, and is taken up by our muscles
to be stored and burned for energy. Blood sugar, though,
is like a vampire. It needs an invitation
to come into our cells.",55.679,15.421,71.1,angry
"And that invitation is insulin. Here's a muscle cell. Here's some blood sugar outside
waiting patiently to come in. Insulin is the key
that unlocks the door to let the sugar in our blood
enter the muscle cell.",71.1,16.61,87.71,angry
"When insulin attaches
to the insulin receptor, it activates an enzyme, which
activates another enzyme, which activates two more enzymes,
which finally activates glucose transport, which acts as a gateway
for glucose to enter the cell. So insulin is the key that unlocks
the door into our muscle cells.",87.71,20.219,107.929,angry
"What if there was 
no insulin though? Well, blood sugar would be
stuck out in the bloodstream banging on the door to our
muscles and not be able to get inside, and so with nowhere to go,
sugar levels would rise and rise. That's what happens
in type 1 diabetes.",107.929,16.131,124.06,angry
"The cells in the pancreas
that make insulin get destroyed, and without insulin,
sugar in the blood can't get out of the blood into the muscles,
and blood sugar rises. But there's a second way we could
end up with high blood sugar. What if there's enough insulin,
but the insulin doesn't work?",124.06,17.91,141.97,angry
"The key is there but something's
gummed up the lock. This is called insulin resistance. Our muscle cells become
resistant to the effect of insulin. What's gumming up the door
locks on our muscle cells preventing insulin
from letting sugar in?",141.97,18.43,160.4,angry
"Fat.  What's called
intramyocellular lipid, fat inside our 
muscle cells. Fat in the bloodstream can build
up inside the muscle cell, creating toxic fatty
breakdown products and free radicals that can block
the signaling pathway process.",160.4,18.09,178.49,angry
"So no matter how much insulin
we have out in our blood, it's not able to open
the glucose gates, and blood sugar levels
build up in the blood. This mechanism by which fat,
specifically saturated fat, induces insulin resistance",178.49,14.98,193.47,angry
"wasn't known until fancy MRI
techniques were developed to see what was happening
inside people's muscles as fat was infused
into their bloodstream. That's how they found out that
elevation of fat levels in the blood causes insulin resistance by inhibition
of glucose transport into the muscles.",193.47,18.61,212.07999999999998,angry
"And this can happen
within just three hours. One hit of fat can start
causing insulin resistance, inhibiting glucose uptake
after just 160 minutes. Same thing happens
to adolescents. You infuse fat into
their bloodstream.",212.08,17.09,229.17000000000002,angry
"It builds up in their muscles and
decreases their insulin sensitivity, showing that increased
fat in the blood can be an important contributor
of insulin resistance. And then you can do
the opposite experiment. Lower the level of fat
in people's blood",229.17,13.65,242.82,angry
"and the insulin resistance
comes right down. Clear the fat out of the blood, and
you clear the sugar out of the blood. So that explains 
this finding. On a high fat diet, the ketogenic diet,
insulin doesn't work as well. Our bodies are 
insulin resistant.",242.82,20.919999999999998,263.74,NA
"But as the amount of fat in
our diet gets lower and lower, insulin works
better and better. This is a clear demonstration
that the sugar tolerance of even healthy individuals
can be impaired by administering a
low-carb, high-fat diet.",263.74,18.94,282.68,NA
"But we can decrease insulin resistance,
the cause of pre-diabetes, the cause of type 2 diabetes,
by decreasing saturated fat intake.",282.68,9.92,292.6,NA
