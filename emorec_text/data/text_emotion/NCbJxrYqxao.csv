ptosis Negron's I want to talk about,2.76,4.289,7.0489999999999995,surprise
this is basically a hyperpigmentation in,4.44,4.86,9.3,surprise
the body folds of the you know,7.049,5.311,12.36,surprise
underneath the armpits the forehead the,9.3,6.209,15.509,
groin different parts of the body where,12.36,5.91,18.27,
it's kind of a darkened appearance now,15.509,5.61,21.119,
if you see someone like this or you have,18.27,5.07,23.34,
this you can pretty much know for sure,21.119,4.261,25.38,fear
what they're consuming it's refined,23.34,4.13,27.47,fear
carbohydrates they're eating frequently,25.38,4.92,30.299999999999997,
because what causes this condition is,27.47,6.64,34.11,
high levels of insulin okay or insulin,30.3,5.64,35.94,
resistance which then causes high levels,34.11,4.98,39.09,
of insulin so that's a pre-diabetic,35.94,5.76,41.699999999999996,
situation and this person could also be,39.09,4.98,44.07000000000001,
a diabetic as well but I just want let,41.7,4.949,46.649,
you know that this can be reversed if,44.07,8.37,52.44,
