hi my name is peg and I'm one of the,0.0,5.42,5.42,surprise
clinical dietitians at Roswell Park,3.3,4.11,7.41,surprise
today we're going to talk about an,5.42,3.94,9.36,surprise
introduction to carbohydrate counting,7.41,4.41,11.82,surprise
for people with diabetes the first thing,9.36,4.47,13.829999999999998,surprise
you need to do in order to count your,11.82,4.229,16.049,surprise
carbohydrates is to determine your,13.83,4.8,18.63,fear
caloric goal first you find your weight,16.049,5.041,21.09,surprise
in kilograms by dividing your weight in,18.63,6.51,25.14,surprise
pounds by 2.2 for example if you weigh a,21.09,6.509,27.599,surprise
hundred and fifty-two pounds you divide,25.14,5.34,30.48,surprise
that by 2.2 you come up with 69,27.599,5.07,32.669,surprise
kilograms then you take a quick,30.48,4.59,35.07,surprise
calculation by the number of kilograms,32.669,6.541,39.209999999999994,fear
times 29 and that's a multiplier used to,35.07,7.079,42.149,fear
determine your maintenance calories your,39.21,4.74,43.95,fear
carbohydrate goal for the day is,42.149,4.68,46.829,fear
approximately forty to sixty percent of,43.95,5.07,49.02,fear
your total calories carbohydrates,46.829,5.431,52.26,surprise
support activity they give you energy so,49.02,5.16,54.18000000000001,surprise
I want you to think of your carbohydrate,52.26,4.68,56.94,
base as your fuel for the day now where,54.18,5.039,59.219,surprise
do carbohydrates come from well they're,56.94,6.72,63.66,surprise
in starches breads pastas rice potatoes,59.219,8.251,67.47,surprise
corn simple sugars and desserts I have,63.66,6.54,70.2,fear
cut potato or 1/3 cup of pasta or rice,67.47,6.0,73.47,fear
or a tablespoon of sugar honey or maple,70.2,5.64,75.84,
syrup are all examples of one,73.47,6.3,79.77,fear
carbohydrate choice so this is a sweet,75.84,5.91,81.75,fear
potato this is about a cup this would be,79.77,4.83,84.6,fear
two carbohydrate servings this pasta is,81.75,5.189,86.939,fear
actually a half cup of cooked pasta so,84.6,5.19,89.78999999999999,fear
it's slightly more than one serving of,86.939,6.081,93.02,fear
pasta and this baked potato is,89.79,5.789,95.57900000000001,fear
approximately 1/2 cup of potato if you,93.02,5.08,98.1,
don't eat the skin so this would be one,95.579,6.781,102.36,
serving of baked potato now a cup of,98.1,6.93,105.03,
milk or a serving of yogurt without,102.36,4.95,107.31,
added sugar is also a carbohydrate,105.03,5.159,110.18900000000001,
serving we have some yogurt here and,107.31,6.54,113.85000000000001,
this is just a plain yogurt and on the,110.189,6.78,116.969,
back the label says carbohydrate 12,113.85,6.869,120.719,fear
grams so this is a no added sugar choice,116.969,6.141,123.11,fear
of yogurt which is a great choice and,120.719,5.371,126.08999999999999,fear
then this yogurt is called fruit side,123.11,5.709,128.819,
and this one has told total,126.09,5.13,131.22,fear
carbohydrates 26 grams,128.819,5.521,134.33999999999997,fear
and the added sugars are 12 grams so,131.22,5.61,136.83,fear
this is almost two servings of,134.34,4.59,138.93,fear
carbohydrate so you see the difference,136.83,4.41,141.24,fear
carbohydrates are also in fruits a,138.93,5.55,144.48000000000002,fear
medium orange a medium apple a cup of,141.24,6.36,147.60000000000002,fear
berries four ounces juice or a half cup,144.48,5.37,149.85,surprise
of canned pears in their own juice are,147.6,4.71,152.31,surprise
examples of one serving of fruit now I,149.85,5.04,154.89,happy
only have one fruit sample here and this,152.31,5.04,157.35,fear
is cantaloupe and this is approximately,154.89,5.19,160.07999999999998,fear
a cup so one cup of melon is also one,157.35,5.28,162.63,fear
fruit serving every 15 grams of,160.08,4.8,164.88000000000002,fear
carbohydrate equals one carbohydrate,162.63,5.31,167.94,surprise
choice so when you read a label every 15,164.88,6.12,171.0,surprise
grams of carbohydrate is one choice so I,167.94,4.74,172.68,surprise
said that twice so you can remember that,171.0,5.1,176.1,
so when we looked at this yogurt the,172.68,5.91,178.59,
label says 12 grams of carbohydrate so,176.1,4.98,181.07999999999998,
that's approximately one serving of,178.59,4.619,183.209,
carbohydrate and in the one with the,181.08,2.85,183.93,
added sugar,183.209,3.601,186.81,
the total carbohydrate is 26 grams so,183.93,5.37,189.3,
again that is two carbohydrate servings,186.81,4.44,191.25,
whether there are added sugars or not,189.3,4.29,193.59,
your total carbohydrate is what matters,191.25,4.8,196.05,
in your body all carbohydrates break,193.59,4.92,198.51,fear
down into sugar some enter the,196.05,4.89,200.94,fear
bloodstream faster than others these are,198.51,5.37,203.88,fear
called high glycemic carbohydrates some,200.94,5.94,206.88,fear
choices are donuts or pastries a low,203.88,5.1,208.98,fear
glycemic carbohydrate and ters the,206.88,4.95,211.82999999999998,
bloodstream slowly plain yogurt is an,208.98,5.13,214.10999999999999,
example of a low glycemic carbohydrate,211.83,4.439,216.269,
so counting carbs and staying within,214.11,4.74,218.85000000000002,NA
your carbohydrate range for the day is a,216.269,4.981,221.25,NA
vital goal in achieving glucose control,218.85,4.77,223.62,NA

choices per meal and three carbohydrate,226.17,5.039,231.20899999999997,NA
choices for a snack so if you look at,228.75,4.38,233.13,NA
some of these meals like for example the,231.209,4.5,235.709,NA
breakfast has two slices of toast where,233.13,4.47,237.6,NA
one slice of toast is a carbohydrate,235.709,4.891,240.6,NA
choice four ounces of juice is a choice,237.6,5.73,243.32999999999998,NA
and the six ounces of low-fat yogurt is,240.6,4.53,245.13,NA
a choice and you should always consult,243.33,4.379,247.709,NA
your dietitian and ask for a referral or,245.13,4.56,249.69,NA
a consult and we can help you out a,247.709,3.81,251.519,NA
