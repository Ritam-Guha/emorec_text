so the goals of our study were to find,9.3,5.549,14.849,happy
out if it's a good idea to give high,11.91,5.93,17.84,happy
dose B vitamins to patients who have,14.849,5.07,19.919,fear
diabetic kidney damage,17.84,5.02,22.86,neutral
it's called diabetic nephropathy what we,19.919,5.911,25.83,neutral
found out was that high-dose vitamins,22.86,6.23,29.09,neutral
made the kidney function decline faster,25.83,7.369,33.199,neutral
than the non active placebo tablets and,29.09,6.219,35.309,happy
patients who were randomized to,33.199,4.961,38.16,neutral
high-dose vitamin had a higher risk of,35.309,4.471,39.78,neutral
strokes and heart attacks over the,38.16,5.19,43.349999999999994,neutral
3-year follow-up so we were shocked,39.78,6.989,46.769,fear
actually by the results when the when I,43.35,6.54,49.89,fear
first saw the results I thought maybe we,46.769,6.78,53.549,
had the randomization code reversed but,49.89,5.729,55.619,
we checked and sure enough patients on,53.549,4.921,58.47,
the active high-dose vitamins had lower,55.619,5.851,61.47,
levels of a blood clotting factor called,58.47,5.04,63.51,
homocysteine which is why we were giving,61.47,4.469,65.939,
them the vitamin so that their Animas,63.51,4.679,68.189,
ation code was correct so diabetic,65.939,4.801,70.74,
nephropathy is kidney damage from the,68.189,5.941,74.13,
diabetes it's thought to be largely due,70.74,6.15,76.89,
to damage to the small artery branches,74.13,6.379,80.509,
in the kidneys called arterioles and,76.89,7.049,83.93900000000001,neutral
it's known that homocysteine aggravates,80.509,5.71,86.219,neutral
the function of those arterioles and,83.939,4.381,88.32,fear
that's why we thought lowering,86.219,3.69,89.90899999999999,neutral
homocysteine levels should make the,88.32,5.939,94.25899999999999,neutral
kidney function better so that's why,89.909,6.63,96.539,neutral
we're so surprised that it didn't people,94.259,5.18,99.439,neutral
with diabetic nephropathy and,96.539,6.78,103.319,neutral
significant kidney impairment impairment,99.439,6.43,105.869,fear
of kidney function should probably stop,103.319,5.19,108.509,angry
taking high-dose B vitamins it doesn't,105.869,5.82,111.689,fear
mean they can't take low doses and the,108.509,7.74,116.249,fear
reasons we think for our results are,111.689,6.42,118.109,fear
that these B vitamins are normally,116.249,4.26,120.509,sad
excreted in the kidney for from the via,118.109,5.33,123.439,fear
the kidney and so we're concerned that,120.509,6.24,126.749,neutral
because the kidney function was impaired,123.439,6.371,129.81,neutral
these patients may have not been able to,126.749,4.861,131.60999999999999,neutral
get rid of the high dose vitamin C the,129.81,3.27,133.08,neutral
normal way and they may have built up,131.61,4.23,135.84,neutral
toxic doses there have been a number of,133.08,5.34,138.42000000000002,
fairly large randomized control trials,135.84,5.37,141.21,
showing no harm of vitamins in people,138.42,3.47,141.89,
with nor,141.21,3.35,144.56,
kidney function this is the first study,141.89,4.56,146.45,
that I know of that's clearly showing,144.56,4.89,149.45,fear
harm of high-dose vitamin C and people,146.45,6.5,152.95,
with impaired kidney function one of the,149.45,6.03,155.48,
consequences of this study is that it,152.95,3.82,156.76999999999998,
means we're going to have to look at,155.48,2.64,158.11999999999998,
other ways of lowering homocysteine,156.77,4.56,161.33,
levels in patients with kidney failure,158.12,4.65,162.77,
and that's something we've been working,161.33,5.22,166.55,
on with medications called thiols that,162.77,6.54,169.31,
that bind homocysteine and get rid of it,166.55,3.96,170.51000000000002,
through the kidneys or through a,169.31,3.69,173.0,
dialysis machine there are quite a few,170.51,4.68,175.19,
people presently taking high-dose,173.0,7.56,180.56,fear
vitamin C to lower homocysteine and what,175.19,7.11,182.3,fear
this means is that if they have kidney,180.56,3.959,184.519,
failure they shouldn't be doing that the,182.3,4.05,186.35000000000002,
