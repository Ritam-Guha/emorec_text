so the goals of our study were to find,9.3,5.549,14.849,sad
out if it's a good idea to give high,11.91,5.93,17.84,sad
dose B vitamins to patients who have,14.849,5.07,19.919,sad
diabetic kidney damage,17.84,5.02,22.86,sad
it's called diabetic nephropathy what we,19.919,5.911,25.83,sad
found out was that high-dose vitamins,22.86,6.23,29.09,sad
made the kidney function decline faster,25.83,7.369,33.199,sad
than the non active placebo tablets and,29.09,6.219,35.309,sad
patients who were randomized to,33.199,4.961,38.16,sad
high-dose vitamin had a higher risk of,35.309,4.471,39.78,sad
strokes and heart attacks over the,38.16,5.19,43.349999999999994,sad
3-year follow-up so we were shocked,39.78,6.989,46.769,sad
actually by the results when the when I,43.35,6.54,49.89,sad
first saw the results I thought maybe we,46.769,6.78,53.549,NA
had the randomization code reversed but,49.89,5.729,55.619,NA
we checked and sure enough patients on,53.549,4.921,58.47,NA
the active high-dose vitamins had lower,55.619,5.851,61.47,NA
levels of a blood clotting factor called,58.47,5.04,63.51,NA
homocysteine which is why we were giving,61.47,4.469,65.939,NA
them the vitamin so that their Animas,63.51,4.679,68.189,NA
ation code was correct so diabetic,65.939,4.801,70.74,NA
nephropathy is kidney damage from the,68.189,5.941,74.13,NA
diabetes it's thought to be largely due,70.74,6.15,76.89,sad
to damage to the small artery branches,74.13,6.379,80.509,sad
in the kidneys called arterioles and,76.89,7.049,83.93900000000001,sad
it's known that homocysteine aggravates,80.509,5.71,86.219,sad
the function of those arterioles and,83.939,4.381,88.32,sad
that's why we thought lowering,86.219,3.69,89.90899999999999,sad
homocysteine levels should make the,88.32,5.939,94.25899999999999,sad
kidney function better so that's why,89.909,6.63,96.539,sad
we're so surprised that it didn't people,94.259,5.18,99.439,sad
with diabetic nephropathy and,96.539,6.78,103.319,sad
significant kidney impairment impairment,99.439,6.43,105.869,sad
of kidney function should probably stop,103.319,5.19,108.509,sad
taking high-dose B vitamins it doesn't,105.869,5.82,111.689,sad
mean they can't take low doses and the,108.509,7.74,116.249,sad
reasons we think for our results are,111.689,6.42,118.109,sad
that these B vitamins are normally,116.249,4.26,120.509,sad
excreted in the kidney for from the via,118.109,5.33,123.439,sad
the kidney and so we're concerned that,120.509,6.24,126.749,sad
because the kidney function was impaired,123.439,6.371,129.81,sad
these patients may have not been able to,126.749,4.861,131.60999999999999,sad
get rid of the high dose vitamin C the,129.81,3.27,133.08,sad
normal way and they may have built up,131.61,4.23,135.84,sad
toxic doses there have been a number of,133.08,5.34,138.42000000000002,sad
fairly large randomized control trials,135.84,5.37,141.21,NA
showing no harm of vitamins in people,138.42,3.47,141.89,NA
with nor,141.21,3.35,144.56,sad
kidney function this is the first study,141.89,4.56,146.45,sad
that I know of that's clearly showing,144.56,4.89,149.45,sad
harm of high-dose vitamin C and people,146.45,6.5,152.95,sad
with impaired kidney function one of the,149.45,6.03,155.48,NA
consequences of this study is that it,152.95,3.82,156.76999999999998,NA
means we're going to have to look at,155.48,2.64,158.11999999999998,NA
other ways of lowering homocysteine,156.77,4.56,161.33,NA
levels in patients with kidney failure,158.12,4.65,162.77,NA
and that's something we've been working,161.33,5.22,166.55,NA
on with medications called thiols that,162.77,6.54,169.31,NA
that bind homocysteine and get rid of it,166.55,3.96,170.51000000000002,NA
through the kidneys or through a,169.31,3.69,173.0,sad
dialysis machine there are quite a few,170.51,4.68,175.19,sad
people presently taking high-dose,173.0,7.56,180.56,sad
vitamin C to lower homocysteine and what,175.19,7.11,182.3,sad
this means is that if they have kidney,180.56,3.959,184.519,sad
failure they shouldn't be doing that the,182.3,4.05,186.35000000000002,sad
