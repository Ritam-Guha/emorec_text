the management of the patients with diffuse large b-cell lymphoma older than 65 years is a relative change Allah for oncologist and hematologist the geriatric assessment could be useful in,4.64,35.69,40.33,angry
order to stratify patients and to decide which approach we have to use in order to avoid another treatment for some patients and then a more toxicity and an under treatment and then a failure of,21.96,31.89,53.85,happy
the figures of the treatment for the other one the elderly project the study we conducted the within the Italian lymphoma foundation is a prospective multicenter study,38.73,28.23,66.96,angry
Amite that will validate the use of simplified geriatric assessment in these patients and that whether the opportunity to integrate clinical futures clinical prognostic factors and,52.2,27.479,79.679,angry
the geriatric assessment for the first time we were able to stratify patients into three groups where the prognosis was a significantly different accordingly to the stratification of the,66.21,29.488999999999997,95.69899999999998,angry
simplified geriatric assessment fit the patients with a very good prognosis intermediate with unfit patients a very bad prognosis in frail patients but because we stratified the patients,80.909,30.060000000000002,110.96900000000001,angry
because of age in terms that the definition of patients are older than eight years ago so that they was not fit for definition we resolved over a more accurate analysis that sometimes the,95.369,36.421,131.79,angry
patients with unfit the or frail patients do not have any probability or any dependence in geriatric assessing the four we reassessed the role of age in,113.939,32.051,145.99,angry
within the simplify compares contents of assessment and we divided the de patients into three different group the first one was the Group one that was composed by all fit patients and unfit,129.53,30.809,160.339,happy
the younger than eight years the second one was damn feet older than 80 and the frail a younger than 80 and the third group was the patient afraid older than eight years the survival was a,145.76,29.311000000000003,175.071,angry
significant different and in a multivariate analysis the three factors were identified as the most important influence of the survival the simplified geriatric assessment the mo globin level,160.52,29.79,190.31,angry
and the high P ice score so we create a different to score a new score the elderly prognostic index that clearly identified three different group operation the low-risk patients where,174.44,29.189999999999998,203.63,happy
the score was a zero one they inter mediate the group where the score was from 2 to 4 and the I risk group where the score was 5 to 7 and the clearly the survival was a completel difference in,189.95,31.799999999999997,221.75,NA
other words this corner can allow us to design a new study in the clinical practice in order to have the opportunity to better stratify the patients that it then be we have to be,205.58,25.32,230.9,NA
enrolled in there in the clinical trials and in the in other world we have a more comfortable approach to these patients,218.66,17.83,236.49,NA
