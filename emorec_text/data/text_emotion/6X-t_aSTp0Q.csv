the geriatric assessment for the first,66.21,5.25,71.46,neutral
time we were able to stratify patients,69.179,6.12,75.299,neutral
into three groups where the prognosis,71.46,6.06,77.52,neutral

bad prognosis in frail patients but,90.329,5.04,95.369,neutral
because we stratified the patients,93.45,6.119,99.569,neutral
because of age in terms that the,95.369,6.661,102.03,neutral
definition of patients are older than,99.569,5.61,105.179,neutral
eight years ago so that they was not fit,102.03,8.46,110.49000000000001,neutral
for definition we resolved over a more,105.179,8.76,113.93900000000001,neutral

in,127.469,6.411,133.88,neutral
within the simplify compares contents of,129.53,7.47,137.0,neutral
assessment and we divided the de,133.88,6.06,139.94,neutral
patients into three different group the,137.0,5.49,142.49,neutral
first one was the Group one that was,139.94,5.82,145.76,neutral
composed by all fit patients and unfit,142.49,5.969,148.459,neutral
the younger than eight years the second,145.76,6.36,152.12,neutral
one was damn feet older than 80 and the,148.459,6.211,154.67000000000002,neutral
frail a younger than 80 and the third,152.12,6.45,158.57,neutral
group was the patient afraid older than,154.67,5.85,160.51999999999998,neutral
eight years the survival was a,158.57,4.44,163.01,neutral

multivariate analysis the three factors,163.01,5.34,168.35,neutral

geriatric assessment the mo globin level,171.05,7.83,178.88000000000002,neutral
and the high P ice score so we create a,174.44,6.96,181.4,neutral
different to score a new score the,178.88,6.96,185.84,neutral
elderly prognostic index that clearly,181.4,6.03,187.43,neutral
identified three different group,185.84,4.11,189.95000000000002,neutral
operation the low-risk patients where,187.43,5.13,192.56,neutral
the score was a zero one they inter,189.95,4.65,194.6,
mediate the group where the score was,192.56,6.51,199.07,
from 2 to 4 and the I risk group where,194.6,8.1,202.7,NA
the score was 5 to 7 and the clearly the,199.07,6.51,205.57999999999998,NA
survival was a completel difference in,202.7,6.03,208.73,NA
other words this corner can allow us to,205.58,4.98,210.56,NA
design a new study in the clinical,208.73,3.99,212.72,NA
practice in order to have the,210.56,4.679,215.239,NA
opportunity to better stratify the,212.72,5.94,218.66,NA
patients that it then be we have to be,215.239,5.731,220.97,NA
enrolled in there in the clinical trials,218.66,5.97,224.63,NA
and in the in other world we have a more,220.97,7.76,228.73,NA
