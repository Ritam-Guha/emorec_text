the geriatric assessment for the first,66.21,5.25,71.46,fear

bad prognosis in frail patients but,90.329,5.04,95.369,sad
because we stratified the patients,93.45,6.119,99.569,sad
because of age in terms that the,95.369,6.661,102.03,fear
definition of patients are older than,99.569,5.61,105.179,fear
eight years ago so that they was not fit,102.03,8.46,110.49000000000001,fear
for definition we resolved over a more,105.179,8.76,113.93900000000001,fear

in,127.469,6.411,133.88,fear
within the simplify compares contents of,129.53,7.47,137.0,sad
assessment and we divided the de,133.88,6.06,139.94,sad
patients into three different group the,137.0,5.49,142.49,sad
first one was the Group one that was,139.94,5.82,145.76,sad

group was the patient afraid older than,154.67,5.85,160.51999999999998,sad
eight years the survival was a,158.57,4.44,163.01,neutral

multivariate analysis the three factors,163.01,5.34,168.35,fear

elderly prognostic index that clearly,181.4,6.03,187.43,fear
identified three different group,185.84,4.11,189.95000000000002,sad
operation the low-risk patients where,187.43,5.13,192.56,sad
the score was a zero one they inter,189.95,4.65,194.6,NA

the score was 5 to 7 and the clearly the,199.07,6.51,205.57999999999998,NA
survival was a completel difference in,202.7,6.03,208.73,NA
other words this corner can allow us to,205.58,4.98,210.56,NA
design a new study in the clinical,208.73,3.99,212.72,NA
practice in order to have the,210.56,4.679,215.239,NA
opportunity to better stratify the,212.72,5.94,218.66,NA
patients that it then be we have to be,215.239,5.731,220.97,NA
enrolled in there in the clinical trials,218.66,5.97,224.63,NA
and in the in other world we have a more,220.97,7.76,228.73,NA
