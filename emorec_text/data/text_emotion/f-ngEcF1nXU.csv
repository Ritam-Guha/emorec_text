so when you have a patient with / if Aarthi there are a number of treatment options to deal with that the main treatment option is medication which I've dealt with in another video there,12.259,32.871,45.13,angry
are also advanced pain management procedures but there's treatments which is called radiofrequency treatments now when you're faced with a patient with peripheral neuropathy who's not,30.46,25.56,56.019999999999996,angry
responding to medication for example or they're getting a lot of excessive adverse effects with medication and so they can no longer take them this is what we would refer to as a minimally,42.1,22.018,64.118,angry
invasive pain management procedure which we use in order to improve the situation now the majority of patients who have peripheral neuropathy the pain that they experience will be in their feet in,53.469,28.832,82.301,angry
their foot and ankle usually on both sides now there are nerves that come out from the lower part of the back usually the l5 and the s-1 nerve roots these are the big nerves which come out right at,67.81,29.07,96.88,angry
the bottom of the back and essentially travel down and ultimately will supply nerve supply to the feet one treatment option that we have that can be very successful is to bring the patient into,82.78,32.64,115.42,angry
hospital as a day case we would put them under an x-ray a little bit of very light sedation so feel nice and relaxed and then we put a tiny little probe down to the nerve root so in this procedure,98.5,35.67,134.17000000000002,angry
the two main targets that we're looking for are right at the bottom of the spine here we're looking at the l5 there's a nerve root which comes out at this level the l5 level and there's one below it,116.68,26.758,143.43800000000002,angry
which comes out of the sacrum which is that what we call the s-1 level now these are the two nerve roots which essentially supply most of the nerve supply to the feet and ankle when,130.179,27.000999999999998,157.18,angry
patients have peripheral neuropathy we will put a tiny probe it's known as a radiofrequency probe that is put down to the l5 nerve root and to the s-1 nerve root those,143.47,26.459,169.929,angry
electrodes are then connected to a radiofrequency machine we put a small electrical current through to test the nerve to make sure that we're in the right place and the patient will,156.909,24.661,181.57,angry
essentially experience a dull pulsing sensation and then we just very very carefully move the probes until we get exactly the area of coverage where the patient's experiencing the worst of,169.329,29.878999999999998,199.208,angry
their pain now once we've achieved that using a smaller current as possible we would then put cycles of an electrical current through the electrodes into the nerve roots in order to try and reset,183.069,33.842,216.911,angry
the nerves and make them function properly so as I said this treatment is called pulsed radiofrequency in this case pulsed radiofrequency to the lower lumbar nerve roots the actual treatment,200.98,31.349,232.32899999999998,angry
itself usually lasts for between two to three minutes it can be done for longer the most important thing is that this treatment is non-destructive so we're not damaging the nerves we're not,216.489,25.169999999999998,241.659,angry
cutting the nerves we're not irritating limit in any way we're actually using a type of electrical treatment called radiofrequency to try and reset the nerves and make them work properly,229.18,25.831000000000003,255.01100000000002,angry
and make them work in a normal functioning pattern in terms of risks and benefits the benefits of the procedure are pain relief it will take approximately 10 to 14 days to work,242.65,25.768,268.418,angry
sometimes less sometimes more in terms of risks these are failure local bleeding bruising infection discomfort you may get some numbness weakness pins and,254.799,22.952,277.75100000000003,angry
"needles afterwards for a few hours and about one in 2,000 people may experience a headache after the procedure in terms of the overall success rates we're usually looking at approximately 65",266.8,28.769000000000002,295.569,angry
percent chance of success of reducing the pay by a minimum of 40% for at least six to nine months the procedures if they're effective can be repeated and often we,280.479,29.009999999999998,309.489,NA
will have patients who will have the procedure done approximately once or twice a year that will keep their symptoms under good control and once we have those symptoms under control the,295.839,22.290000000000003,318.129,NA
great thing is that if they are on any other medication it may be possible to cut down on that medication which may be giving them side effects and they can get on with things much more easily,306.879,26.619,333.49800000000005,NA
