so when you have a patient with / if,12.259,7.58,19.839,neutral
Aarthi there are a number of treatment,16.96,6.45,23.41,neutral
options to deal with that the main,19.839,6.03,25.869,NA
treatment option is medication which,23.41,7.05,30.46,neutral
I've dealt with in another video there,25.869,5.761,31.63,neutral
are also advanced pain management,30.46,4.44,34.9,fear
procedures but there's treatments which,31.63,6.389,38.019,fear
is called radiofrequency treatments now,34.9,5.13,40.03,neutral
when you're faced with a patient with,38.019,4.081,42.1,neutral
peripheral neuropathy who's not,40.03,5.52,45.55,NA
responding to medication for example or,42.1,4.979,47.079,NA
they're getting a lot of excessive,45.55,3.629,49.178999999999995,fear
adverse effects with medication and so,47.079,4.591,51.67,fear
they can no longer take them this is,49.179,4.29,53.469,fear
what we would refer to as a minimally,51.67,4.529,56.199,fear
invasive pain management procedure which,53.469,6.77,60.239000000000004,fear
we use in order to improve the situation,56.199,6.93,63.129,neutral
now the majority of patients who have,60.239,5.531,65.77,fear
peripheral neuropathy the pain that they,63.129,4.681,67.81,fear
experience will be in their feet in,65.77,4.92,70.69,fear
their foot and ankle usually on both,67.81,6.449,74.259,neutral
sides now there are nerves that come out,70.69,6.09,76.78,NA
from the lower part of the back usually,74.259,6.301,80.56,NA
the l5 and the s-1 nerve roots these are,76.78,6.0,82.78,fear
the big nerves which come out right at,80.56,4.23,84.79,fear
the bottom of the back and essentially,82.78,4.92,87.7,fear
travel down and ultimately will supply,84.79,8.369,93.159,NA
nerve supply to the feet one treatment,87.7,7.529,95.229,NA
option that we have that can be very,93.159,5.341,98.5,neutral
successful is to bring the patient into,95.229,6.481,101.71,neutral
hospital as a day case we would put them,98.5,5.82,104.32,neutral
under an x-ray a little bit of very,101.71,5.4,107.11,neutral
light sedation so feel nice and relaxed,104.32,7.11,111.42999999999999,neutral
and then we put a tiny little probe down,107.11,9.57,116.68,neutral
to the nerve root so in this procedure,111.43,7.77,119.2,neutral
the two main targets that we're looking,116.68,5.34,122.02000000000001,neutral
for are right at the bottom of the spine,119.2,6.269,125.46900000000001,neutral
here we're looking at the l5 there's a,122.02,5.309,127.329,neutral
nerve root which comes out at this level,125.469,4.71,130.179,neutral
the l5 level and there's one below it,127.329,5.13,132.459,neutral
which comes out of the sacrum which is,130.179,5.011,135.19,sad
that what we call the s-1 level now,132.459,4.771,137.23,sad
these are the two nerve roots which,135.19,4.47,139.66,neutral
essentially supply most of the nerve,137.23,6.24,143.47,neutral
supply to the feet and ankle when,139.66,6.509,146.16899999999998,neutral
patients have peripheral neuropathy we,143.47,5.19,148.66,neutral
will put a tiny probe it's known as a,146.169,4.261,150.43,fear
radiofrequency probe,148.66,4.71,153.37,fear
that is put down to the l5 nerve root,150.43,6.479,156.90900000000002,fear
and to the s-1 nerve root those,153.37,5.819,159.189,fear
electrodes are then connected to a,156.909,5.461,162.37,NA
radiofrequency machine we put a small,159.189,6.27,165.459,NA
electrical current through to test the,162.37,4.589,166.959,sad
nerve to make sure that we're in the,165.459,3.87,169.329,sad
right place and the patient will,166.959,4.471,171.43,happy
essentially experience a dull pulsing,169.329,4.621,173.95000000000002,sad
sensation and then we just very very,171.43,5.85,177.28,neutral
carefully move the probes until we get,173.95,7.259,181.209,neutral
exactly the area of coverage where the,177.28,5.789,183.069,NA
patient's experiencing the worst of,181.209,6.36,187.56900000000002,NA
their pain now once we've achieved that,183.069,7.95,191.01899999999998,fear
using a smaller current as possible we,187.569,6.06,193.629,neutral
would then put cycles of an electrical,191.019,7.231,198.25,neutral
current through the electrodes into the,193.629,7.351,200.98,neutral
nerve roots in order to try and reset,198.25,5.25,203.5,NA
the nerves and make them function,200.98,6.06,207.04,NA
properly so as I said this treatment is,203.5,6.48,209.98,NA
called pulsed radiofrequency in this,207.04,5.94,212.98,sad
case pulsed radiofrequency to the lower,209.98,6.509,216.48899999999998,NA
lumbar nerve roots the actual treatment,212.98,6.36,219.34,NA
itself usually lasts for between two to,216.489,4.801,221.29,NA
three minutes it can be done for longer,219.34,4.859,224.199,sad
the most important thing is that this,221.29,5.97,227.26,fear
treatment is non-destructive so we're,224.199,4.981,229.18,neutral
not damaging the nerves we're not,227.26,4.559,231.819,neutral
cutting the nerves we're not irritating,229.18,5.639,234.81900000000002,NA
limit in any way we're actually using a,231.819,5.551,237.36999999999998,NA
type of electrical treatment called,234.819,5.79,240.60899999999998,fear
radiofrequency to try and reset the,237.37,5.28,242.65,fear
nerves and make them work properly,240.609,3.571,244.18,fear
and make them work in a normal,242.65,4.679,247.329,surprise
functioning pattern in terms of risks,244.18,5.279,249.459,neutral
and benefits the benefits of the,247.329,5.22,252.549,neutral
procedure are pain relief it will take,249.459,5.34,254.799,neutral
approximately 10 to 14 days to work,252.549,5.25,257.799,surprise
sometimes less sometimes more in terms,254.799,4.321,259.12,fear
of risks,257.799,3.87,261.669,fear
these are failure local bleeding,259.12,5.94,265.06,sad
bruising infection discomfort you may,261.669,5.131,266.79999999999995,sad
get some numbness weakness pins and,265.06,3.69,268.75,NA
needles afterwards for a few hours and,266.8,4.5,271.3,NA
"about one in 2,000 people may experience",268.75,6.03,274.78,NA
a headache after the procedure in terms,271.3,6.66,277.96000000000004,NA
of the overall success rates we're,274.78,5.699,280.479,NA
usually looking at approximately 65,277.96,5.88,283.84,NA
percent chance of success of reducing,280.479,3.84,284.31899999999996,NA
the pay,283.84,4.229,288.06899999999996,NA
by a minimum of 40% for at least six to,284.319,7.53,291.849,NA
nine months the procedures if they're,288.069,7.77,295.839,NA
effective can be repeated and often we,291.849,5.641,297.49,NA
will have patients who will have the,295.839,4.05,299.889,NA
procedure done approximately once or,297.49,4.649,302.139,NA
twice a year that will keep their,299.889,5.28,305.169,NA
symptoms under good control and once we,302.139,4.74,306.879,NA
have those symptoms under control the,305.169,3.571,308.74,NA
great thing is that if they are on any,306.879,4.32,311.199,NA
other medication it may be possible to,308.74,5.009,313.749,NA
cut down on that medication which may be,311.199,5.821,317.02000000000004,NA
giving them side effects and they can,313.749,7.37,321.119,NA
