so when you have a patient with / if,12.259,7.58,19.839,angry
Aarthi there are a number of treatment,16.96,6.45,23.41,angry
options to deal with that the main,19.839,6.03,25.869,angry
treatment option is medication which,23.41,7.05,30.46,angry
I've dealt with in another video there,25.869,5.761,31.63,angry
are also advanced pain management,30.46,4.44,34.9,angry
procedures but there's treatments which,31.63,6.389,38.019,angry
is called radiofrequency treatments now,34.9,5.13,40.03,angry
when you're faced with a patient with,38.019,4.081,42.1,angry
peripheral neuropathy who's not,40.03,5.52,45.55,angry
responding to medication for example or,42.1,4.979,47.079,angry
they're getting a lot of excessive,45.55,3.629,49.178999999999995,angry
adverse effects with medication and so,47.079,4.591,51.67,angry
they can no longer take them this is,49.179,4.29,53.469,angry
what we would refer to as a minimally,51.67,4.529,56.199,angry
invasive pain management procedure which,53.469,6.77,60.239000000000004,angry
we use in order to improve the situation,56.199,6.93,63.129,angry
now the majority of patients who have,60.239,5.531,65.77,
peripheral neuropathy the pain that they,63.129,4.681,67.81,
experience will be in their feet in,65.77,4.92,70.69,angry
their foot and ankle usually on both,67.81,6.449,74.259,angry
sides now there are nerves that come out,70.69,6.09,76.78,angry
from the lower part of the back usually,74.259,6.301,80.56,angry
the l5 and the s-1 nerve roots these are,76.78,6.0,82.78,angry
the big nerves which come out right at,80.56,4.23,84.79,angry
the bottom of the back and essentially,82.78,4.92,87.7,
travel down and ultimately will supply,84.79,8.369,93.159,
nerve supply to the feet one treatment,87.7,7.529,95.229,
option that we have that can be very,93.159,5.341,98.5,
successful is to bring the patient into,95.229,6.481,101.71,
hospital as a day case we would put them,98.5,5.82,104.32,
under an x-ray a little bit of very,101.71,5.4,107.11,
light sedation so feel nice and relaxed,104.32,7.11,111.42999999999999,angry
and then we put a tiny little probe down,107.11,9.57,116.68,angry
to the nerve root so in this procedure,111.43,7.77,119.2,angry
the two main targets that we're looking,116.68,5.34,122.02000000000001,angry
for are right at the bottom of the spine,119.2,6.269,125.46900000000001,angry
here we're looking at the l5 there's a,122.02,5.309,127.329,angry
nerve root which comes out at this level,125.469,4.71,130.179,angry
the l5 level and there's one below it,127.329,5.13,132.459,angry
which comes out of the sacrum which is,130.179,5.011,135.19,angry
that what we call the s-1 level now,132.459,4.771,137.23,angry
these are the two nerve roots which,135.19,4.47,139.66,angry
essentially supply most of the nerve,137.23,6.24,143.47,angry
supply to the feet and ankle when,139.66,6.509,146.16899999999998,angry
patients have peripheral neuropathy we,143.47,5.19,148.66,angry
will put a tiny probe it's known as a,146.169,4.261,150.43,angry
radiofrequency probe,148.66,4.71,153.37,angry
that is put down to the l5 nerve root,150.43,6.479,156.90900000000002,angry
and to the s-1 nerve root those,153.37,5.819,159.189,angry
electrodes are then connected to a,156.909,5.461,162.37,angry
radiofrequency machine we put a small,159.189,6.27,165.459,angry
electrical current through to test the,162.37,4.589,166.959,angry
nerve to make sure that we're in the,165.459,3.87,169.329,angry
right place and the patient will,166.959,4.471,171.43,angry
essentially experience a dull pulsing,169.329,4.621,173.95000000000002,angry
sensation and then we just very very,171.43,5.85,177.28,angry
carefully move the probes until we get,173.95,7.259,181.209,angry
exactly the area of coverage where the,177.28,5.789,183.069,angry
patient's experiencing the worst of,181.209,6.36,187.56900000000002,angry
their pain now once we've achieved that,183.069,7.95,191.01899999999998,angry
using a smaller current as possible we,187.569,6.06,193.629,angry
would then put cycles of an electrical,191.019,7.231,198.25,angry
current through the electrodes into the,193.629,7.351,200.98,angry
nerve roots in order to try and reset,198.25,5.25,203.5,angry
the nerves and make them function,200.98,6.06,207.04,angry
properly so as I said this treatment is,203.5,6.48,209.98,angry
called pulsed radiofrequency in this,207.04,5.94,212.98,angry
case pulsed radiofrequency to the lower,209.98,6.509,216.48899999999998,angry
lumbar nerve roots the actual treatment,212.98,6.36,219.34,angry
itself usually lasts for between two to,216.489,4.801,221.29,angry
three minutes it can be done for longer,219.34,4.859,224.199,angry
the most important thing is that this,221.29,5.97,227.26,angry
treatment is non-destructive so we're,224.199,4.981,229.18,angry
not damaging the nerves we're not,227.26,4.559,231.819,angry
cutting the nerves we're not irritating,229.18,5.639,234.81900000000002,angry
limit in any way we're actually using a,231.819,5.551,237.36999999999998,angry
type of electrical treatment called,234.819,5.79,240.60899999999998,angry
radiofrequency to try and reset the,237.37,5.28,242.65,angry
nerves and make them work properly,240.609,3.571,244.18,angry
and make them work in a normal,242.65,4.679,247.329,angry
functioning pattern in terms of risks,244.18,5.279,249.459,angry
and benefits the benefits of the,247.329,5.22,252.549,angry
procedure are pain relief it will take,249.459,5.34,254.799,angry
approximately 10 to 14 days to work,252.549,5.25,257.799,angry
sometimes less sometimes more in terms,254.799,4.321,259.12,angry
of risks,257.799,3.87,261.669,angry
these are failure local bleeding,259.12,5.94,265.06,angry
bruising infection discomfort you may,261.669,5.131,266.79999999999995,angry
get some numbness weakness pins and,265.06,3.69,268.75,angry
needles afterwards for a few hours and,266.8,4.5,271.3,angry
"about one in 2,000 people may experience",268.75,6.03,274.78,
a headache after the procedure in terms,271.3,6.66,277.96000000000004,NA
of the overall success rates we're,274.78,5.699,280.479,NA
usually looking at approximately 65,277.96,5.88,283.84,NA
percent chance of success of reducing,280.479,3.84,284.31899999999996,NA
the pay,283.84,4.229,288.06899999999996,NA
by a minimum of 40% for at least six to,284.319,7.53,291.849,NA
nine months the procedures if they're,288.069,7.77,295.839,NA
effective can be repeated and often we,291.849,5.641,297.49,NA
will have patients who will have the,295.839,4.05,299.889,NA
procedure done approximately once or,297.49,4.649,302.139,NA
twice a year that will keep their,299.889,5.28,305.169,NA
symptoms under good control and once we,302.139,4.74,306.879,NA
have those symptoms under control the,305.169,3.571,308.74,NA
great thing is that if they are on any,306.879,4.32,311.199,NA
other medication it may be possible to,308.74,5.009,313.749,NA
cut down on that medication which may be,311.199,5.821,317.02000000000004,NA
giving them side effects and they can,313.749,7.37,321.119,NA
get on with things much more easily,317.02,4.099,321.11899999999997,NA
