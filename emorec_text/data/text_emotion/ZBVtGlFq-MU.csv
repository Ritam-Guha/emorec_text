so we have,2.159,4.24,6.399,happy
really two categories of medications um,3.04,5.44,8.48,happy
those that target at the level of the,6.399,3.521,9.92,fear
tumor itself,8.48,3.36,11.84,fear
uh in order to reduce growth hormone,9.92,3.2,13.120000000000001,fear
secretion and in,11.84,3.919,15.759,fear
some cases shrink the tumor remnant that,13.12,3.999,17.119,fear
is present,15.759,3.36,19.119,fear
we also have therapies that are more,17.119,4.401,21.52,fear
targeted at decreasing the insulin-like,19.119,4.641,23.759999999999998,fear
growth factor or igf-1 production from,21.52,3.04,24.56,fear
the liver,23.76,2.64,26.400000000000002,fear
in response to that growth hormone,24.56,3.2,27.759999999999998,fear
secretion from the tumor,26.4,4.16,30.56,fear
so really at two different levels and,27.76,4.56,32.32,fear
these can be used as,30.56,4.96,35.519999999999996,fear
single or monotherapies and in some,32.32,5.12,37.44,fear
cases it is necessary to use,35.52,2.879,38.399,fear
combinations,37.44,3.84,41.28,fear
of these medications to control growth,38.399,4.721,43.120000000000005,fear
hormone igf-1 levels,41.28,4.88,46.160000000000004,fear
and tumor growth at the level of the,43.12,4.4,47.519999999999996,fear
tumor,46.16,4.399,50.559,fear
we think about somatostatin receptor,47.52,3.84,51.36,fear
ligands,50.559,3.281,53.839999999999996,fear
these are medications that bind to a,51.36,4.879,56.239,fear
receptor on the surface of the tumor,53.84,4.96,58.800000000000004,fear
they turn down growth hormone production,56.239,3.441,59.68,fear
uh they can,58.8,3.759,62.559,fear
slow growth tumor growth and sometimes,59.68,4.879,64.559,fear
even lead to cell death,62.559,4.321,66.88,fear
and so these are um very important,64.559,3.92,68.479,fear
medications for use,66.88,4.08,70.96,fear
for patients with acromegaly they,68.479,4.881,73.36,fear
include some of,70.96,6.64,77.6,fear
the older injectables sandostatin lar,73.36,8.399,81.759,fear
and lanreatide autogel are both,77.6,6.72,84.32,fear
intermittent intramuscular or deep,81.759,5.281,87.04,fear
subcutaneous injections respectively,84.32,4.4,88.72,fear
that patients will have an injection,87.04,3.92,90.96000000000001,fear
every four weeks and in some cases every,88.72,4.16,92.88,fear
six to eight weeks depending on the,90.96,3.28,94.24,fear
control of their,92.88,4.879,97.759,fear
of their disease um a newer uh,94.24,5.76,100.0,fear
medication in the landscape in the last,97.759,3.201,100.96,fear
decade,100.0,4.0,104.0,fear
is passariotide lar it is a similar,100.96,5.04,106.0,fear
somatostatin receptor ligand although it,104.0,2.56,106.56,angry
is,106.0,3.6,109.6,angry
uh more activity in many of these tumors,106.56,4.48,111.04,angry
and can be used for,109.6,5.199,114.79899999999999,angry
more aggressive or um large tumors that,111.04,6.0,117.04,angry
are not as responsive to actual tidal,114.799,3.6,118.399,angry
and rheotide,117.04,3.6,120.64,fear
um and then and then we now have the new,118.399,3.521,121.92,fear
kid on the block which is,120.64,3.519,124.159,fear
oral octreotide capsules so we,121.92,3.28,125.2,fear
understand how,124.159,4.32,128.479,fear
octreotide works to treat growth hormone,125.2,4.96,130.16,fear
tumors and so now,128.479,3.601,132.08,angry
uh there is an oral formulation so,130.16,4.0,134.16,sad
instead of a monthly injection,132.08,5.12,137.20000000000002,fear
or um or every six weeks or every eight,134.16,4.079,138.239,fear
weeks patients,137.2,2.8,140.0,fear
now have a choice to do the oral,138.239,3.841,142.08,fear
octreotide capsules which would,140.0,4.56,144.56,fear
be twice daily and so it just really,142.08,3.92,146.0,fear
depends on,144.56,4.8,149.36,fear
the patient's preference their,146.0,6.0,152.0,fear
own personal characteristics in terms of,149.36,3.28,152.64000000000001,fear
the,152.0,3.44,155.44,fear
tumor as to whether which of those,152.64,6.0,158.64,fear
therapies would be appropriate for them,155.44,6.56,162.0,
with regard to a therapy that targets at,158.64,5.04,163.67999999999998,NA
the level of the liver,162.0,4.48,166.48,NA
we have pigvisimont which inhibits the,163.68,3.52,167.20000000000002,NA
production,166.48,2.64,169.11999999999998,NA
of insulin like growth factor from the,167.2,4.24,171.44,NA
liver in response to growth hormone,169.12,5.04,174.16,NA
so it's not really going to control the,171.44,3.439,174.879,NA
tumor,174.16,3.2,177.35999999999999,NA
growth per se or shrink the tumor but it,174.879,4.961,179.84,NA
does lead to lower igf-1 and can really,177.36,3.76,181.12,NA
alleviate symptoms,179.84,6.0,185.84,NA
in many patients because of that hormone,181.12,4.72,185.84,NA
