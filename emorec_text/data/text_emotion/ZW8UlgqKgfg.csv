If you are somebody who has been told that you need to lose 20 or 30kgs and if you want to improve your diabetes you need to completely change your exercise and activity levels you may not have been told,9.957,9.629999999999999,19.587,NA
what you need know. And if you watch this short video it will all become clear. I just wanted to spend a little bit of time explaining,19.587,7.176,26.762999999999998,NA
"this concept of the Body Mass Index and the 'ideal body weight', so that you better understand how achievable really quite significant success is.",31.913,11.275,43.188,NA
"So the first thing is about Body Mass Index BMI and simply it is a measure of your weight, in kilograms",45.848,8.046,53.894,NA
"divided by your height, in metres and for mathematical reasons they square the height. So if I weighed 60kg and I was 1.5m in height,",53.894,13.389,67.283,NA
"then it would be 60kg over 1.5 x 1.5 and that would give me my BMI. And the normal reference range, or what we call the normal range, is based on clinical studies",67.523,11.378,78.901,NA
that tracked the risk of somebody developing a complication and compared the risk to the Body Mass Index and if I draw this this is what we call a J shaped curve,80.611,13.302999999999999,93.914,NA
"because actually if you are too thin it is not good, people who are very thin often have higher rates of risk of developing problems",97.064,9.07,106.13399999999999,NA
"and then as the weight goes up there is an exponential increase in risk that occurs as your BMI goes up. But there is a little spot, right down the bottom, where the risk is at its lowest",106.864,9.19,116.054,NA
and that is how we define the normal reference range and for most people that is between 20-25. And so that is when we talk about idea body weight,116.974,9.095999999999998,126.07000000000001,NA
it is ideal because it has the lowest rate of risk for things going wrong so we think that is the most positive place to be. But what happens to people who are,126.46,9.892,136.352,NA
"significantly overweight? Perhaps their BMI is 30, so that is the definition of obese, or 35 or 40 and if you start to plot that group of people",136.532,11.078,147.61,NA
you can see that the risk becomes incredibly high for certain people and the higher your Body Mass Index is the greater the risk.,149.53,6.962,156.492,NA
So people for example with a BMI of 40 have a risk that is really incredibly challenging. But the other interesting thing is that if you can reduce your Body Mass Index,157.242,9.297999999999998,166.54,NA
from say 40 down to 35 that is a substantial risk reduction. And if you can reduce it from 35 down to 30 that is still a substantial risk reduction,168.07,11.362000000000002,179.432,NA
but not as big as the person that has reduced their weight from a BMI of 40 down to 35. And if you go from 30 to 25 again there is further risk reduction,181.752,8.790999999999999,190.543,NA
but it is not as substantial. So whilst we talk to people about their ideal body weight and if they weigh 100kgs perhaps their ideal body weight,193.233,7.998,201.231,NA
"might be 70kgs, in fact changing from 100 down to 90 has a profound effect because a person literally slides down the BMI curve.",201.961,10.964999999999998,212.92600000000002,NA
And in doing so has a massive risk reduction. So the trick with weight loss is not to think about what your ideal body weight is because that actually,215.886,8.405000000000001,224.291,NA
"may be very difficult to achieve particularly if you are 30, 40, 50kgs above what you should be. The trick with weight reduction is to understand the benefits that you get",226.081,10.038,236.119,NA
by making small modest changes. And just if we look at something like diabetes if a person is able to lose about 10% of their body weight so if you weigh 110kgs,238.749,10.072000000000001,248.821,NA
"then you are looking at 11kgs, that has a profound impact on how well your insulin works on your glucose control, and your cholesterol",250.481,7.473,257.954,NA
and your blood pressure. It is not about achieving perfection. It is about reducing risk as quickly and as effectively as possible in the most achievable way.,259.774,8.207999999999998,267.98199999999997,NA
