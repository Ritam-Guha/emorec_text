If you are somebody who has been told,9.957,1.377,11.334000000000001,fear
that you need to lose 20 or 30kgs,11.334,2.256,13.59,NA
and if you want to improve your diabetes,13.59,1.28,14.87,NA
you need to completely change your exercise and activity levels,14.87,3.539,18.409,NA
you may not have been told,18.409,1.178,19.587,NA
what you need know.,19.587,1.577,21.164,NA
And if you watch this short video,21.164,1.662,22.826,NA
it will all become clear.,22.826,1.635,24.461000000000002,NA
I just wanted to spend,29.611,0.867,30.478,sad
a little bit of time explaining,30.478,1.435,31.913,neutral
this concept of the Body Mass Index,31.913,1.944,33.857,fear
"and the 'ideal body weight',",33.857,1.548,35.405,sad
so that you better understand,36.875,2.622,39.497,NA
how achievable,39.497,2.13,41.627,NA
really quite significant success is.,41.627,3.031,44.658,sad
So the first thing is,45.848,0.873,46.721,sad
about Body Mass Index,46.721,0.927,47.647999999999996,neutral
BMI,47.648,1.353,49.001000000000005,sad
and simply,49.001,1.393,50.394,NA
"it is a measure of your weight, in kilograms",50.394,3.5,53.894,NA
"divided by your height, in metres",53.894,3.021,56.915,fear
and for mathematical reasons,56.915,1.904,58.819,sad
they square the height.,58.819,1.456,60.275000000000006,NA
So if I weighed 60kg,60.515,3.612,64.127,NA
"and I was 1.5m in height,",64.127,3.396,67.523,neutral
then it would be 60kg over 1.5 x 1.5,67.523,3.932,71.455,NA
and that would give me my BMI.,72.245,1.287,73.53200000000001,NA
"And the normal reference range,",74.452,1.977,76.429,NA
"or what we call the normal range,",76.429,1.519,77.94800000000001,NA
is based on clinical studies,77.948,2.663,80.61099999999999,NA
that tracked the risk of somebody,80.611,3.284,83.89500000000001,NA
developing a complication,83.895,2.591,86.48599999999999,NA
and compared the risk to the Body Mass Index,86.486,2.905,89.391,NA
and if I draw this,90.051,1.629,91.68,NA
this is what we call a J shaped curve,92.8,2.894,95.694,NA
because actually if you are too thin,97.064,2.036,99.1,NA
"it is not good,",99.1,1.351,100.451,NA
people who are very thin,100.451,1.738,102.189,NA
often have higher rates,102.189,1.826,104.01499999999999,NA
of risk of developing problems,104.015,2.119,106.134,fear
and then as the weight goes up,106.864,1.16,108.024,fear
there is an exponential increase in risk,108.024,2.352,110.376,NA
that occurs as your BMI goes up.,110.376,1.846,112.22200000000001,NA
"But there is a little spot, right down the bottom,",113.142,2.131,115.273,NA
where the risk is at its lowest,115.273,1.701,116.97399999999999,NA
and that is how we define,116.974,2.426,119.4,NA
the normal reference range,119.4,1.252,120.652,NA
and for most people that is between 20-25.,120.652,3.211,123.863,NA
And so that is when we talk about,124.253,1.209,125.462,NA
idea body weight,125.462,0.998,126.46000000000001,NA
it is ideal because it has the lowest rate of risk,126.46,3.715,130.17499999999998,NA
for things going wrong,130.175,1.031,131.20600000000002,NA
so we think that is the most positive,131.206,1.437,132.643,NA
place to be.,132.643,0.741,133.38400000000001,NA
But what happens to people who are,133.564,2.968,136.53199999999998,NA
significantly overweight?,136.532,1.428,137.96,NA
"Perhaps their BMI is 30,",138.57,3.045,141.61499999999998,NA
"so that is the definition of obese,",142.235,1.729,143.96400000000003,NA
or 35 or 40,143.964,2.574,146.538,NA
and if you start to plot that group of people,147.228,2.302,149.53,NA
you can see that the risk,149.53,1.447,150.977,NA
becomes incredibly high,150.977,1.795,152.772,NA
for certain people,152.772,1.062,153.834,NA
and the higher your Body Mass Index is,153.834,1.533,155.367,NA
the greater the risk.,155.367,1.125,156.492,NA
So people for example,157.242,0.936,158.178,NA
with a BMI of 40,158.178,1.581,159.759,NA
have a risk that is really incredibly challenging.,160.349,2.901,163.25,NA
But the other interesting thing is,164.19,2.085,166.275,fear
that if you can reduce your Body Mass Index,166.275,1.795,168.07,fear
from say 40,168.07,1.67,169.73999999999998,neutral
down to 35,169.74,1.479,171.21900000000002,NA
that is a substantial risk reduction.,172.379,3.834,176.213,NA
And if you can reduce it from 35 down to 30,177.373,2.432,179.80499999999998,NA
that is still a substantial risk reduction,179.805,1.947,181.752,NA
but not as big as the person,181.752,2.051,183.803,NA
that has reduced their weight from a BMI of 40,183.803,2.292,186.095,fear
down to 35.,186.095,1.158,187.253,fear
And if you go from 30 to 25,188.863,1.497,190.36,fear
again there is further risk reduction,190.36,1.793,192.15300000000002,fear
but it is not as substantial.,193.233,1.488,194.721,fear
So whilst we talk to people about,195.451,1.808,197.259,NA
their ideal body weight,197.259,1.331,198.58999999999997,sad
and if they weigh 100kgs,198.59,2.321,200.911,fear
perhaps their ideal body weight,200.911,1.05,201.961,NA
"might be 70kgs,",201.961,1.174,203.13500000000002,NA
in fact changing from 100 down to 90,204.355,3.769,208.124,fear
has a profound effect,208.994,1.322,210.316,NA
because a person literally slides down,210.316,3.449,213.76500000000001,NA
the BMI curve.,213.765,1.251,215.016,NA
And in doing so has a,215.886,1.899,217.785,fear
massive risk reduction.,217.785,1.836,219.621,sad
So the trick with weight loss,220.901,1.383,222.28400000000002,NA
is not to think about what your ideal body weight is,222.284,2.495,224.779,NA
because that actually,225.289,0.792,226.081,NA
may be very difficult to achieve,226.081,2.141,228.22199999999998,NA
"particularly if you are 30, 40, 50kgs",228.222,1.697,229.919,NA
above what you should be.,229.919,1.223,231.14200000000002,NA
The trick with weight reduction is to understand,233.272,3.154,236.426,NA
the benefits that you get,236.926,1.823,238.749,NA
by making small modest changes.,238.749,1.948,240.697,NA
And just if we look at something like diabetes,241.417,1.964,243.381,NA
if a person is able to lose about 10%,244.141,2.645,246.786,NA
of their body weight,246.966,1.714,248.68,NA
so if you weigh 110kgs,248.68,1.801,250.481,NA
"then you are looking at 11kgs,",250.481,1.488,251.969,NA
that has a profound impact,252.849,2.057,254.90599999999998,NA
on how well your insulin works,255.846,1.451,257.297,NA
"on your glucose control,",257.297,1.19,258.487,NA
and your cholesterol,258.487,1.287,259.774,NA
and your blood pressure.,259.774,1.021,260.795,NA
It is not about achieving perfection.,261.665,1.656,263.321,NA
It is about reducing risk as quickly,263.941,2.625,266.566,NA
and as effectively as possible,266.566,1.504,268.07,NA
in the most achievable way.,268.8,1.402,270.202,NA
