"Louie became unwell, he was three and a
half. I'd taken him to the doctors because he'd started off with a temperature and
just generally not right, but there was other little signs as well. I did mention
to the GP that it was the end of May and he was drinking excessive, beakers of
water and we thought, oh it's a bit hot so maybe it's the weather that he's, you
know, going back and forth drinking all the time.",0.03,33.85,33.88,angry
"And didn't think much of it and then
one night I got up and heard him in the bath, and now, you know he is a child who goes
to bed and you don't hear him till morning, using the bathroom, drinking from
the tap, drinking water from the sink and he didn't generally like plain water it would have to be squash normally. So took him to the GP and took a urine sample and they
said, oh more likely a water infection",34.44,28.02,62.459999999999994,sad
"we'll put him on antibiotics, so they took
the sample. A week later he's just going downhill rapidly, he was lying on the settee
and he was just so lethargic. The week before I'd put him in a new outfit and his
little shorts fell down even with the adjustable waistband in it, and that's
when I realised he'd lost weight as well. But even know all these little things it
didn't, because the doctor had said to me",62.46,30.771,93.231,angry
"oh it's a water infection, you don't
add them up. So my husband took him the surgery and they blood finger prick
tested him and tested his urine and his blood sugars were over thirty and he
had ketones, and they he said we're gonna have to admit him to hospital
now. Because we did catch it early and if when we took him into the hospital the
consultant actually said that most",93.24,26.0,119.24,sad
"children of his age are brought in
unconscious and in DKA because their blood sugars are high, so they said that we
were lucky that we caught him early before he got so unwell he had to go
into intensive care. My advice is to trust your instincts and if you're in doubt, please go
and ask your GP and ask",119.24,22.538999999999998,141.779,sad
"them, tell them if they have any of the
symptoms of the four T's tell you your GP and ask can they be tested because it's a
simple test that could save your child's life.",142.18,9.4,151.58,NA
