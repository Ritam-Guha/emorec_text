why does a very low carb diet sometimes,3.38,9.25,12.629999999999999,surprise
give a higher blood glucose reading the,7.649,6.691,14.34,surprise
question being sometimes you're led to,12.63,2.879,15.509,angry
believe that if you go on a low,14.34,4.62,18.96,surprise
carbohydrate diet that your diabetes,15.509,7.201,22.71,surprise
will be treated forever well if you it's,18.96,5.46,24.42,angry
true if you lower the carbohydrates you,22.71,3.84,26.55,fear
basically stabilize insulin but what,24.42,4.89,29.310000000000002,angry
happens you push them way down well the,26.55,5.28,31.830000000000002,angry
brain needs carbohydrates and it gets,29.31,5.249,34.559,
desperate up there so what it does it,31.83,5.34,37.17,
calls out for extra carbohydrates by,34.559,4.711,39.269999999999996,
sending out a signal to the pink to the,37.17,4.68,41.85,
adrenal glands to put secrete more,39.27,5.699,44.969,
cortisol cortisol will break down your,41.85,5.88,47.730000000000004,
muscle to make glucose the brains happy,44.969,4.801,49.77,
you're losing muscle mass but the brain,47.73,4.68,52.41,
is happy but as you have more cortisol,49.77,4.71,54.480000000000004,
up there what happens you develop,52.41,4.05,56.459999999999994,
insulin resistance and now blood sugar,54.48,4.829,59.309,
levels begin to rise again so that's why,56.46,5.31,61.77,
when you talk about hormones you cannot,59.309,5.371,64.67999999999999,
talk about any one hormone in absence of,61.77,5.31,67.08,
how other hormones affect it so if I,64.68,5.369,70.049,
push you know insulin to low the body,67.08,5.91,72.99,
responds by pushing up cortisol and what,70.049,5.57,75.619,
this course I'll do it makes you fatter,72.99,7.41,80.39999999999999,
sicker and dumber so of that's why you,75.619,6.341,81.96,
have to basically that's why I call the,80.4,5.46,85.86,
zone diet there are zones it's a matter,81.96,6.81,88.77,
of balancing and of once you basically,85.86,5.07,90.93,
say what kind of Bounce I have protein,88.77,3.779,92.54899999999999,NA
carb right and fat I'm going to try to,90.93,3.99,94.92,NA
find the best balance that can keep all,92.549,5.03,97.57900000000001,NA
my hormones which are directly or,94.92,5.73,100.65,NA
indirectly affected by the foods we eat,97.579,5.981,103.55999999999999,NA
in that therapeutic zone and the best,100.65,4.95,105.60000000000001,NA
way no you you're in that zone you're,103.56,5.72,109.28,NA
simply not hungry throughout the day,105.6,3.68,109.28,NA
