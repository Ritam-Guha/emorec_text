issues okay so if there's liver damage if you have a fatty liver or you have cirrhosis it's scar tissue that can come from the fatty liver which both come from high levels of insulin or insulin,71.52,23.219,94.739,angry
resistance okay that's gonna inhibit your ability to store sugar in the liver the great majority of all the stored sugar that helps you between the meal to regulate,83.549,25.771,109.32000000000001,NA
your fuel is called glycogen and it's stored in the liver so if your liver is damaged you won't have the capacity of stored sugar to release and keep your blood Sugar's normal when you're not,95.64,21.87,117.51,NA
eating okay so let's number one because you just don't have the quantity of sugar to stabilize yourself between meals because the liver is fatty or there's some type,108.06,21.240000000000002,129.3,NA
of damage to it number two you have a problem with this other hormone called igf-1 that's insulin-like growth factor number one now what is that that's another hormone that is very,117.57,22.468999999999998,140.039,NA
similar to insulin but it works when you're not eating whereas insulin converts things into fat IGF does the opposite and releases the energy from,129.09,21.891000000000002,150.981,NA
fat and stored sugar into energy between the meals so you have these two things working back and forth insulin triggered when you're eating and IGF triggered when you're not eating for the purpose,139.54,24.54,164.07999999999998,NA
