we're here to talk about the in people with type 2 diabetes and today at the ad a we our largest trial on a investigational hepatitis B vaccine that we just,6.03,23.81,29.84,NA
completed the trial and we presented our immunogenicity and safety the CDC actually has looked that and they determined through their studies that people with type 2 diabetes,20.48,23.948,44.428,NA
are twice as likely to get hepatitis B and it's mostly exposure is that folks with type type 2 diabetes are have a lot of exposure to medical equipment and obviously blood you know blood sticks,33.76,30.869999999999997,64.63,NA
for example and that equipment can be invisibly contaminated and the hepatitis B virus is remarkably stable environmentally stable and it's 100 times more infectious than HIV,50.05,26.948,76.99799999999999,NA
certainly if they develop hepatitis than they you know that they they would need to have specialist care of course to deal it particularly to develop acute hepatitis or any of the sequelae of,65.659,20.970999999999997,86.63,NA
hepatitis B infection which unfortunately aren't very you know they're cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma cancer so obviously would require treatment the most important,76.28,22.161,98.441,NA
thing is to prevent it by far so the global research as we evaluated this investigational hepatitis B vaccine called helpless ave and the goal was there was to determine the,86.45,22.56,109.01,NA
immunogenicity and safety in a population of type the people type 2 diabetes for the immunogenicity results we showed that people in a study we showed that,100.1,26.349,126.449,NA
the serial protection rate for people who received helpless at was ninety percent versus 65.1 percent for the active comparator which was an existing hepatitis B vaccine index being that,116.619,25.32,141.939,angry
difference of twenty four point nine percent was statistically significant and then on the safety side we studied safety of course in over eight thousand trial participants and the rates of,129.729,25.441,155.17000000000002,NA
adverse events serious adverse events and deaths were similar between the two vaccine arm any adverse events were considerably immune-related were evaluated by an independent and blinded,142.33,24.15,166.48000000000002,NA
safety evaluation and June occation committee or siak tough acronym and they found that none of those events were related to vaccination I think one of the big advantages a,154.33,22.63,176.96,NA
helpless happy I suppose is that because of this adjutant that we're using we have a special whole like receptor nine agonist as an adjuvant in the vaccine we use the standard surface antigen Plus,167.98,24.51,192.48999999999998,neutral
this adjuvant this allows the vaccine to be administered in two doses over one month existing vaccines are three doses over six months and we know that people have a difficult time getting all three,179.44,27.210000000000004,206.65,NA
doses in fact the CDC's vaccine safety data link study showed that only fifty four percent of people who start the three dose regimen complete it within a year,193.66,25.150000000000002,218.81,NA
happens that B is specifically for hepatitis B prevention in adults not it will be more than just the the more than just people with diabetes but this is a diabetes meeting and that was the focus,208.9,23.988999999999997,232.889,NA
"of today the reasons is that it the hepatitis B remains a public and important public health problem and challenge there's about 20,000 infections every year and we do immunize",220.87,22.719999999999995,243.59,NA
children and have been doing that regularly since 1991 but there still is this is you know a nun significant number of cases every year and it's and it is preventable,232.659,22.211000000000002,254.87,NA
well the indication that we're pursuing is for all adults 18 and above and in the we and as I mentioned we do have this data in people with type 2 diabetes which is important because of the,245.68,28.628999999999998,274.309,NA
increased risk that these people have and current rates of coverage for people with type 2 diabetes for hepatitis B is pretty lowest only twenty-three percent according to our data no to this vaccine,260.299,31.281,291.58,NA
the response rates it appears to be similar sorry summer to what we see in a population of the who have people who don't have diabetes we have filed an application a biologics,278.38,21.099999999999998,299.48,NA
license application with the Food and Drug Administration and we have a Purdue fat date of fifteen december this year I think the most important things it gives physicians like myself who deal,293.4,24.308999999999997,317.70899999999995,NA
with people type 2 diabetes another option to help prevent hepatitis B just the importance of people getting immunized and protecting themselves to vaccine preventable disease and I dealt,307.88,19.38,327.26,NA
with a lot of people with type 2 diabetes and and other diseases and if we can prevent a disease with a vaccine that's a really good thing I think the most important thing is to,317.24,20.441,337.681,NA
listen to those people and people have concerns carefully and then present them with the data as we understand it and they can make their own decisions but I think they should understand the data,329.74,16.977999999999998,346.718,NA
and the opportunity to prevent disease is really important,337.899,8.082,345.981,NA
