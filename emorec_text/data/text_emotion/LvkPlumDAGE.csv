we're here to talk about the,6.03,3.92,9.95,
in people with type 2 diabetes and today,10.01,5.1,15.11,fear
at the ad a we,12.83,5.24,18.07,neutral
our largest trial on a investigational,15.11,5.37,20.48,fear
hepatitis B vaccine that we just,18.07,4.18,22.25,fear
completed the trial and we presented our,20.48,5.059,25.539,fear
immunogenicity and safety,22.25,3.289,25.539,
the CDC actually has looked,26.71,5.31,32.02,
that and they determined through their,28.99,4.77,33.76,neutral
studies that people with type 2 diabetes,32.02,5.52,37.540000000000006,
are twice as likely to get hepatitis B,33.76,7.619,41.379,fear
and it's mostly exposure is that folks,37.54,7.08,44.62,fear
with type type 2 diabetes are have a lot,41.379,5.241,46.62,fear
of exposure to medical equipment and,44.62,5.43,50.05,fear
obviously blood you know blood sticks,46.62,5.5,52.12,fear
for example and that equipment can be,50.05,6.0,56.05,fear
invisibly contaminated and the hepatitis,52.12,5.99,58.11,neutral
B virus is remarkably stable,56.05,4.71,60.76,neutral
environmentally stable and it's 100,58.11,6.449,64.559,
times more infectious than HIV,60.76,3.799,64.559,
certainly if they develop hepatitis than,65.659,3.691,69.35000000000001,
they you know that they they would need,67.909,4.32,72.22900000000001,neutral
to have specialist care of course to,69.35,4.439,73.78899999999999,neutral
deal it particularly to develop acute,72.229,4.051,76.28,neutral
hepatitis or any of the sequelae of,73.789,4.47,78.259,neutral
hepatitis B infection which,76.28,3.689,79.969,neutral
unfortunately aren't very you know,78.259,3.86,82.119,fear
they're cirrhosis and hepatocellular,79.969,4.981,84.94999999999999,fear
carcinoma cancer so obviously would,82.119,4.331,86.45,fear
require treatment the most important,84.95,5.3,90.25,fear
thing is to prevent it by far,86.45,3.8,90.25,fear
so the global research as we evaluated,91.06,4.48,95.54,neutral
this investigational hepatitis B vaccine,93.5,5.13,98.63,neutral
called helpless ave and the goal was,95.54,4.56,100.10000000000001,neutral
there was to determine the,98.63,4.59,103.22,neutral
immunogenicity and safety in a,100.1,5.04,105.14,neutral
population of type the people type 2,103.22,4.22,107.44,neutral
diabetes,105.14,2.3,107.44,
for the immunogenicity results we showed,108.67,7.949,116.619,neutral
that people in a study we showed that,112.09,6.84,118.93,neutral
the serial protection rate for people,116.619,4.201,120.82,neutral
who received helpless at was ninety,118.93,5.61,124.54,neutral
percent versus 65.1 percent for the,120.82,5.939,126.75899999999999,neutral
active comparator which was an existing,124.54,5.189,129.729,neutral
hepatitis B vaccine index being that,126.759,4.381,131.14,neutral
difference of twenty four point nine,129.729,3.601,133.33,neutral
percent was statistically significant,131.14,5.16,136.29999999999998,neutral
and then on the safety side we studied,133.33,5.85,139.18,neutral
safety of course in over eight thousand,136.3,6.03,142.33,neutral
trial participants and the rates of,139.18,4.8,143.98000000000002,neutral
adverse events serious adverse events,142.33,4.82,147.15,neutral
and deaths were similar between the two,143.98,6.63,150.60999999999999,neutral
vaccine arm any adverse events were,147.15,4.869,152.019,neutral
considerably immune-related were,150.61,3.72,154.33,neutral
evaluated by an independent and blinded,152.019,4.111,156.13,neutral
safety evaluation and June occation,154.33,5.01,159.34,neutral
committee or siak tough acronym and they,156.13,4.5,160.63,neutral
found that none of those events were,159.34,4.82,164.16,neutral
related to vaccination,160.63,3.53,164.16,neutral
I think one of the big advantages a,165.46,4.77,170.23000000000002,neutral
helpless happy I suppose is that because,167.98,4.44,172.42,neutral
of this adjutant that we're using we,170.23,3.9,174.13,neutral
have a special whole like receptor nine,172.42,4.17,176.58999999999997,neutral
agonist as an adjuvant in the vaccine we,174.13,5.31,179.44,neutral
use the standard surface antigen Plus,176.59,6.69,183.28,neutral
this adjuvant this allows the vaccine to,179.44,5.82,185.26,neutral
be administered in two doses over one,183.28,3.96,187.24,neutral
month existing vaccines are three doses,185.26,5.64,190.89999999999998,neutral
over six months and we know that people,187.24,6.42,193.66,neutral
have a difficult time getting all three,190.9,5.37,196.27,neutral
doses in fact the CDC's vaccine safety,193.66,5.85,199.51,neutral
data link study showed that only fifty,196.27,7.68,203.95000000000002,neutral
four percent of people who start the,199.51,5.82,205.32999999999998,neutral
three dose regimen complete it within a,203.95,3.59,207.54,neutral
year,205.33,2.21,207.54000000000002,fear
happens that B is specifically for,208.9,5.309,214.209,neutral
hepatitis B prevention in adults not it,211.06,5.31,216.37,neutral
will be more than just the the more than,214.209,5.071,219.28,neutral
just people with diabetes but this is a,216.37,4.5,220.87,neutral
diabetes meeting and that was the focus,219.28,3.799,223.079,neutral
of today the reasons is that it the,220.87,4.979,225.84900000000002,neutral
hepatitis B remains a public and,223.079,4.27,227.34900000000002,neutral
important public health problem and,225.849,4.47,230.319,neutral
"challenge there's about 20,000",227.349,5.31,232.659,neutral
infections every year and we do immunize,230.319,3.691,234.01,neutral
children and have been doing that,232.659,4.08,236.739,neutral
regularly since 1991 but there still is,234.01,5.849,239.85899999999998,neutral
this is you know a nun significant,236.739,5.041,241.78,neutral
number of cases every year and it's and,239.859,4.581,244.44,neutral
it is preventable,241.78,2.66,244.44,neutral
well the indication that we're pursuing,245.68,7.14,252.82,neutral
is for all adults 18 and above and in,248.45,7.26,255.70999999999998,neutral
the we and as I mentioned we do have,252.82,5.1,257.92,neutral
this data in people with type 2 diabetes,255.71,4.589,260.29900000000004,neutral
which is important because of the,257.92,4.54,262.46000000000004,neutral
increased risk that these people have,260.299,6.811,267.10999999999996,neutral
and current rates of coverage for people,262.46,7.62,270.08,neutral
with type 2 diabetes for hepatitis B is,267.11,6.38,273.49,neutral
pretty lowest only twenty-three percent,270.08,3.41,273.49,
according to our data no to this vaccine,275.31,7.06,282.37,neutral
the response rates it appears to be,278.38,6.09,284.46999999999997,neutral
similar sorry summer to what we see in a,282.37,4.139,286.509,neutral
population of the who have people who,284.47,4.52,288.99,fear
don't have diabetes,286.509,2.481,288.99,fear
we have filed an application a biologics,290.729,3.87,294.599,neutral
license application with the Food and,293.4,4.379,297.779,neutral
Drug Administration and we have a Purdue,294.599,8.03,302.62899999999996,neutral
fat date of fifteen december this year,297.779,4.85,302.629,neutral
I think the most important things it,304.16,3.72,307.88000000000005,fear
gives physicians like myself who deal,305.9,3.33,309.22999999999996,neutral
with people type 2 diabetes another,307.88,3.48,311.36,neutral
option to help prevent hepatitis B just,309.23,3.18,312.41,neutral
the importance of people getting,311.36,2.85,314.21000000000004,neutral
immunized and protecting themselves to,312.41,4.83,317.24,neutral
vaccine preventable disease and I dealt,314.21,5.04,319.25,neutral
with a lot of people with type 2,317.24,4.26,321.5,neutral
diabetes and and other diseases and if,319.25,4.53,323.78,fear
we can prevent a disease with a vaccine,321.5,5.21,326.71,fear
that's a really good thing,323.78,2.93,326.71,fear
I think the most important thing is to,327.849,3.511,331.36,fear
listen to those people and people have,329.74,3.209,332.949,neutral
concerns carefully and then present them,331.36,3.239,334.599,neutral
with the data as we understand it and,332.949,3.661,336.61,neutral
they can make their own decisions but I,334.599,3.3,337.899,neutral
think they should understand the data,336.61,3.569,340.17900000000003,fear
and the opportunity to prevent disease,337.899,5.181,343.08,fear
is really important,340.179,2.901,343.08,fear
