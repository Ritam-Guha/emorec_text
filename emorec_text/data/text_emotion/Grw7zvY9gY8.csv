to any problem with the vasculature of the",7.33,4.32,11.65,fear
body.,11.65,1.0,12.65,fear
Those would be the arteries and veins.,12.65,2.0,14.65,fear

vascular beds in the body.",14.65,3.81,18.46,neutral

heart, and then, the vascular bed which feeds",23.96,4.079,28.039,fear

the disease which affects the vasculature",29.64,4.59,34.230000000000004,fear

our lower extremities and legs.",34.23,4.06,38.29,neutral

smoking, plays a large factor.",57.46,3.75,61.21,neutral

vascular disease?",61.21,3.309,64.519,neutral

ways.",64.519,3.501,68.02000000000001,neutral

doctor.",91.37,2.41,93.78,NA
