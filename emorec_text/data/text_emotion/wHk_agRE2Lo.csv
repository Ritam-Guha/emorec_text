to the affected portion in this case the,0.06,6.36,6.42,
foot so what we have on the right foot,4.04,5.86,9.9,
is we have a mummified toe the second,6.42,7.53,13.95,
toe is actually not living at this point,9.9,8.82,18.72,
the third toe was amputated and that was,13.95,7.02,20.97,
a couple of weeks ago and then now as,18.72,4.29,23.009999999999998,
everyone can see the fourth toe is dusky,20.97,5.25,26.22,
it's actually purple bluish in color and,23.01,5.4,28.410000000000004,
this extends around this area as well,26.22,5.25,31.47,
the thick toe I won't have you come,28.41,6.69,35.1,
around here but the the fifth toe is,31.47,8.55,40.019999999999996,
also turning this color as well so this,35.1,7.41,42.510000000000005,
portion of the foot there is a very very,40.02,7.14,47.160000000000004,
high likelihood that he may lose a,42.51,8.819,51.329,
portion of this foot and again what,47.16,5.879,53.038999999999994,
we're trying to do is save as much as we,51.329,3.931,55.26,
can we're letting the area demarcate and,53.039,4.68,57.719,
let the body actually decide what it,55.26,5.25,60.51,
wants to keep and whatever it does not,57.719,4.801,62.52,
in respect to the left foot the same,60.51,4.649,65.15899999999999,
thing is actually occurring he did have,62.52,4.889,67.409,
just to let people know how brittle,65.159,4.411,69.57000000000001,
these these patients are he apparently,67.409,4.471,71.88000000000001,
bumped a tiny little of the tip of the,69.57,7.26,76.83,
toe and then led him to this right you,71.88,7.83,79.71,
sigh from from the obvious the dark part,76.83,5.01,81.84,
which is the tissue that is not living,79.71,4.199,83.90899999999999,
you can actually sell ready see the,81.84,4.709,86.549,fear
purple color and I'm not going to let,83.909,4.861,88.77000000000001,
you guys see this but I'll you know the,86.549,4.201,90.75,
bottom is also a little bit purple and,88.77,3.27,92.03999999999999,
the tips of the toes I don't have the,90.75,2.85,93.6,
casein see they're already white a,92.04,4.649,96.68900000000001,
little bit white purple and and this is,93.6,6.96,100.55999999999999,
what we call a critical limb ischemia,96.689,6.091,102.77999999999999,
then this scheme it means no blood flow,100.56,4.99,105.55,
and that's essentially what's happened,102.78,7.419,110.199,
[Music],105.55,4.649,110.199,neutral
so our goal right now is is to continue,111.34,7.51,118.85000000000001,neutral
to maximize our efforts to save the legs,116.3,6.179,122.479,
okay that's what we're doing and again,118.85,5.28,124.13,
it gets to a point where because these,122.479,4.381,126.86,
arteries are so tiny that the blood does,124.13,5.519,129.649,
just is not flowing to the toes we,126.86,4.8,131.66,neutral
actually have to do it on the opposite,129.649,4.201,133.85,neutral
where now we have to move towards the,131.66,4.04,135.7,neutral
arteries that are a little bit bigger so,133.85,6.78,140.63,neutral
you know we're here we're here and we're,135.7,7.87,143.57,neutral
definitely putting a plan on attack that,140.63,5.46,146.09,
wall we're gonna definitely try to say,143.57,3.93,147.5,
you know the same saving lives saving,146.09,3.0,149.09,neutral
lives were here and then up in a,147.5,4.02,151.52,neutral
situation where it's about life more,149.09,5.73,154.82,
than anything now so I'll keep you guys,151.52,6.51,158.03,
afloat on this particular case and like,154.82,5.49,160.31,
always try to educate the community on,158.03,8.63,166.66,
what we do thank you for watching,160.31,6.35,166.66,
