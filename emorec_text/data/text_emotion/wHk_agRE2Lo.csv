to the affected portion in this case the,0.06,6.36,6.42,neutral
foot so what we have on the right foot,4.04,5.86,9.9,neutral
is we have a mummified toe the second,6.42,7.53,13.95,neutral
toe is actually not living at this point,9.9,8.82,18.72,neutral
the third toe was amputated and that was,13.95,7.02,20.97,fear
a couple of weeks ago and then now as,18.72,4.29,23.009999999999998,neutral
everyone can see the fourth toe is dusky,20.97,5.25,26.22,neutral
it's actually purple bluish in color and,23.01,5.4,28.410000000000004,neutral
this extends around this area as well,26.22,5.25,31.47,NA
the thick toe I won't have you come,28.41,6.69,35.1,NA
around here but the the fifth toe is,31.47,8.55,40.019999999999996,NA
also turning this color as well so this,35.1,7.41,42.510000000000005,NA
portion of the foot there is a very very,40.02,7.14,47.160000000000004,neutral
high likelihood that he may lose a,42.51,8.819,51.329,neutral
portion of this foot and again what,47.16,5.879,53.038999999999994,NA
we're trying to do is save as much as we,51.329,3.931,55.26,NA
can we're letting the area demarcate and,53.039,4.68,57.719,NA
let the body actually decide what it,55.26,5.25,60.51,neutral
wants to keep and whatever it does not,57.719,4.801,62.52,neutral
in respect to the left foot the same,60.51,4.649,65.15899999999999,neutral
thing is actually occurring he did have,62.52,4.889,67.409,neutral
just to let people know how brittle,65.159,4.411,69.57000000000001,neutral
these these patients are he apparently,67.409,4.471,71.88000000000001,NA
bumped a tiny little of the tip of the,69.57,7.26,76.83,NA
toe and then led him to this right you,71.88,7.83,79.71,NA
sigh from from the obvious the dark part,76.83,5.01,81.84,neutral
which is the tissue that is not living,79.71,4.199,83.90899999999999,neutral
you can actually sell ready see the,81.84,4.709,86.549,neutral
purple color and I'm not going to let,83.909,4.861,88.77000000000001,neutral
you guys see this but I'll you know the,86.549,4.201,90.75,neutral
bottom is also a little bit purple and,88.77,3.27,92.03999999999999,NA
the tips of the toes I don't have the,90.75,2.85,93.6,NA
casein see they're already white a,92.04,4.649,96.68900000000001,NA
little bit white purple and and this is,93.6,6.96,100.55999999999999,NA
what we call a critical limb ischemia,96.689,6.091,102.77999999999999,neutral
then this scheme it means no blood flow,100.56,4.99,105.55,neutral
and that's essentially what's happened,102.78,7.419,110.199,neutral
[Music],105.55,4.649,110.199,neutral
so our goal right now is is to continue,111.34,7.51,118.85000000000001,neutral
to maximize our efforts to save the legs,116.3,6.179,122.479,neutral
okay that's what we're doing and again,118.85,5.28,124.13,neutral
it gets to a point where because these,122.479,4.381,126.86,neutral
arteries are so tiny that the blood does,124.13,5.519,129.649,neutral
just is not flowing to the toes we,126.86,4.8,131.66,neutral
actually have to do it on the opposite,129.649,4.201,133.85,neutral
where now we have to move towards the,131.66,4.04,135.7,neutral
arteries that are a little bit bigger so,133.85,6.78,140.63,neutral
you know we're here we're here and we're,135.7,7.87,143.57,neutral
definitely putting a plan on attack that,140.63,5.46,146.09,neutral
wall we're gonna definitely try to say,143.57,3.93,147.5,neutral
you know the same saving lives saving,146.09,3.0,149.09,neutral
lives were here and then up in a,147.5,4.02,151.52,neutral
situation where it's about life more,149.09,5.73,154.82,neutral
than anything now so I'll keep you guys,151.52,6.51,158.03,neutral
afloat on this particular case and like,154.82,5.49,160.31,neutral
always try to educate the community on,158.03,8.63,166.66,neutral
what we do thank you for watching,160.31,6.35,166.66,neutral
