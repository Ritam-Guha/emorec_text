affect the baby I had a growth scam and the baby's growth it came to shore up so that's why the tasted microRNA I was a bit of a short because obviously it was the very end of my pregnancy and then I,37.769,23.519000000000002,61.288,angry
had to do these like wasted changes and but I hear exercise a little bit and change a diet then you can control it yourself and I was put on medication for the remainder of my pregnancy,49.739,24.202000000000005,73.941,angry
