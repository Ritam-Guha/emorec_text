I'm Lindsay and I gave birth to my,14.84,5.32,20.16,
little girl yesterday and I was,17.76,4.109,21.869,
diagnosed with gestational diabetes,20.16,4.89,25.05,
about their two sex weeks pregnant so I,21.869,5.581,27.45,
had to have him a blood test to confirm,25.05,4.95,30.0,fear
that and take my blood Sugar's before,27.45,4.26,31.71,fear
and after each meal,30.0,5.79,35.79,
and after that I had to change like my,31.71,6.059,37.769,
diet and my lifestyle because it does,35.79,4.86,40.65,
affect the baby I had a growth scam and,37.769,5.581,43.35,
the baby's growth it came to shore up so,40.65,4.71,45.36,
that's why the tasted microRNA I was a,43.35,4.11,47.46,surprise
bit of a short because obviously it was,45.36,4.379,49.739,surprise
the very end of my pregnancy and then I,47.46,4.739,52.199,surprise
had to do these like wasted changes and,49.739,5.271,55.01,surprise
but I hear exercise a little bit and,52.199,5.25,57.449,
change a diet then you can control it,55.01,4.899,59.909,
yourself and I was put on medication for,57.449,4.231,61.68,
the remainder of my pregnancy,59.909,4.551,64.46,
um but again that was under control and,61.68,4.92,66.6,
they keep oh good morning to turn on,64.46,4.96,69.41999999999999,surprise
year and I was induced at there to nine,66.6,6.15,72.75,surprise
weeks and she's here safe and sound,69.42,5.6,75.02,
you can still breastfeed if you like and,72.75,5.4,78.15,
yeah um I've got to have an annual blood,75.02,6.099,81.119,
sugar test at my GP and there's risks of,78.15,5.7,83.85000000000001,
type 2 diabetes in later life but as,81.119,4.32,85.439,
long as you just keep doing what you're,83.85,4.619,88.469,happy
doing then you should be okay so as a,85.439,4.86,90.29899999999999,happy
positive experience if you can make it,88.469,4.171,92.64,
one um and the staff have been really,90.299,6.93,97.22900000000001,
good so six weeks after and the baby's,92.64,7.38,100.02,
born and I have another blood sugar test,97.229,4.68,101.90899999999999,
which will tell me if it's completely,100.02,3.629,103.649,
gone because once you've delivered your,101.909,4.981,106.89,
baby in the it's the placenta and that,103.649,5.46,109.109,
that's where the disease sort of common,106.89,7.35,114.24,
strong so one Sam that's going then it,109.109,10.89,119.999,
should be okay so once baby's born and,114.24,7.229,121.469,
the next day you have a fasting blood,119.999,3.811,123.81,
sugar in the morning and that was that,121.469,4.53,125.999,
was fame for me luckily so that means I,123.81,2.879,126.68900000000001,
was all good to go,125.999,5.131,131.13,
and the baby has blood sugar test after,126.689,7.111,133.79999999999998,
the first two feeds which again we're,131.13,4.65,135.78,
good so although we have to take your,133.8,3.45,137.25,
blood sugars like before and after each,135.78,3.75,139.53,surprise
meal you get used to it you get quicker,137.25,5.88,143.13,surprise
at it as like easy once you start doing,139.53,4.08,143.61,surprise
it and,143.13,3.27,146.4,
you get into a routine just like you're,143.61,3.93,147.54000000000002,
going to get into routine we have your,146.4,2.22,148.62,fear
baby so,147.54,9.36,156.89999999999998,
