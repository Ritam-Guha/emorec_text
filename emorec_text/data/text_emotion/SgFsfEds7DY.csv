there's a few um,2.48,3.12,5.6,
key points that i think will be useful,3.84,3.919,7.759,neutral
in terms of identifying patients earlier,5.6,4.32,9.92,neutral
in medical practice one is look at,7.759,3.92,11.679,neutral
patients hands,9.92,4.799,14.719000000000001,neutral
hands that the rings can't get off or a,11.679,4.0,15.679,neutral
patient that's,14.719,3.601,18.32,neutral
had to resize their ring over several,15.679,5.36,21.039,neutral
times in the course of a decade,18.32,4.879,23.198999999999998,neutral
ask for changes in size of feet that,21.039,4.08,25.119,neutral
will be a signal because usually feet,23.199,3.92,27.119,neutral
don't really grow in adulthood,25.119,4.08,29.198999999999998,neutral
new spaces between the teeth because of,27.119,3.601,30.72,neutral
jawed growth,29.199,4.081,33.28,neutral
is very unusual during adulthood so,30.72,4.4,35.12,neutral
those are all signs that someone should,33.28,2.56,35.84,neutral
be tested,35.12,3.04,38.16,neutral
hand growth foot growth new spaces,35.84,3.92,39.760000000000005,neutral
between teeth and adulthood,38.16,3.36,41.519999999999996,neutral
on top of that i think the biggest thing,39.76,3.36,43.12,neutral
for primary care doctors or general,41.52,2.64,44.160000000000004,neutral
physicians to remember,43.12,2.0,45.12,neutral
is that when you start to get a,44.16,3.6,47.76,neutral
clustering of symptoms that are fairly,45.12,3.84,48.959999999999994,neutral
common but,47.76,4.4,52.16,neutral
they are all in one patient so you have,48.96,4.16,53.120000000000005,fear
somebody with maybe,52.16,4.399,56.559,fear
earlier onset hypertension diabetes,53.12,4.32,57.44,neutral
that's getting,56.559,5.121,61.68,neutral
worse sleep apnea that's a fairly common,57.44,6.0,63.44,neutral
constellation in patients but when you,61.68,3.439,65.119,neutral
get all of those things and,63.44,3.039,66.479,sad
any of these changes that go with,65.119,3.521,68.64,neutral
acromegaly you have to think about it,66.479,4.0,70.479,neutral
not everyone will have the classic look,68.64,3.68,72.32000000000001,neutral
with a large chin and a large nose and,70.479,3.521,74.0,neutral
the larger brow it can be very subtle,72.32,2.72,75.03999999999999,neutral
facial changes,74.0,3.52,77.52,neutral
so if you have comorbidities that,75.04,4.32,79.36000000000001,neutral
congregate together,77.52,4.32,81.84,neutral
early hypertension worsening diabetes,79.36,3.6,82.96,fear
sleep apnea,81.84,3.04,84.88000000000001,fear
you have to think about acromegaly a,82.96,4.0,86.96,neutral
little bit sooner colonic polyps are,84.88,2.879,87.759,neutral
also,86.96,2.799,89.759,neutral
sometimes in the in the list of,87.759,3.36,91.119,neutral
comorbidities there,89.759,3.201,92.96,neutral
and i've seen a lot of patients that,91.119,3.521,94.64,neutral
have all of those and they're coming to,92.96,3.6,96.55999999999999,neutral
me like 10 years later with like,94.64,4.479,99.119,neutral
very late stage acromegaly and each one,96.56,4.4,100.96000000000001,neutral
of those comorbidities was treated just,99.119,2.801,101.92,neutral
as its own,100.96,3.519,104.479,neutral
problem not related to a single source,101.92,4.0,105.92,neutral
which is the growth hormone,104.479,4.401,108.88,neutral
excess and the final point in terms of,105.92,4.64,110.56,neutral
remembering to think about this disease,108.88,2.72,111.6,neutral
is in women,110.56,2.8,113.36,fear
that may look like they have a more,111.6,3.44,115.03999999999999,neutral
common disease which is called,113.36,4.0,117.36,neutral
polycystic ovarian syndrome where their,115.04,4.0,119.04,neutral
periods are irregular,117.36,4.0,121.36,neutral
and they get hair growth and acne maybe,119.04,4.56,123.60000000000001,neutral
they have trouble getting pregnant,121.36,4.32,125.68,neutral
some of these women with acromegaly have,123.6,3.76,127.36,neutral
seen fertility doctors,125.68,4.079,129.75900000000001,neutral
been treated with fertility drugs,127.36,4.08,131.44,neutral
sometimes successfully,129.759,3.84,133.599,neutral
and the reason for their infertility is,131.44,3.68,135.12,neutral
actually growth hormone,133.599,5.28,138.879,neutral
excess which can be a cause of a pcos or,135.12,5.92,141.04,neutral
polycystic ovarian syndrome,138.879,5.281,144.16,fear
like picture so that's that can kind of,141.04,4.64,145.67999999999998,neutral
fake you out and be,144.16,4.719,148.879,neutral
missed easily the other um,145.68,4.559,150.239,neutral
the other piece of history that we,148.879,3.761,152.64,neutral
sometimes get get a chance to see,150.239,4.961,155.20000000000002,neutral
you know retrospectively is that a woman,152.64,3.92,156.55999999999997,neutral
has presented,155.2,3.28,158.48,neutral
with fertility treatment then went on to,156.56,3.28,159.84,neutral
get pregnant and had gestational,158.48,2.56,161.04,neutral
diabetes,159.84,3.2,163.04,neutral
and that is also common in someone who,161.04,5.36,166.4,neutral
has growth hormone excess that's,163.04,3.36,166.4,neutral
uncontrolled,167.72,3.0,170.72,
