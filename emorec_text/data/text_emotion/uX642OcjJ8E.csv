acromegaly,4.279,5.32,9.599,sad
is thought of as a rare disease,5.52,7.119,12.639,sad
with very specific,9.599,6.561,16.16,sad
characteristic manifestations,12.639,7.121,19.759999999999998,sad
these manifestations can include changes,16.16,5.279,21.439,sad
in the way the patients look,19.76,5.839,25.599000000000004,sad
so coarsening of their features,21.439,6.801,28.240000000000002,sad
increased in the size of the tongue,25.599,3.121,28.72,sad
teeth,28.24,3.76,32.0,sad
shifting and enlargement of the hands,28.72,3.679,32.399,sad
and,32.0,2.96,34.96,fear
feet which is what we call acronym,32.399,4.801,37.2,sad
enlargement,34.96,5.439,40.399,sad
the problem was looking at acromegaly,37.2,7.08,44.28,sad
in this fashion as a disease with,40.399,6.961,47.36,sad
pathognomonic features is that,44.28,6.439,50.719,sad
these features develop slowly over the,47.36,5.359,52.719,sad
course of years,50.719,5.601,56.32,sad
which tends to delay the diagnosis,52.719,6.64,59.359,sad
by more than five years,56.32,6.32,62.64,sad
in the past it was actually more than,59.359,6.8,66.159,sad
10 years that a patient would experience,62.64,7.28,69.92,sad
in terms of a delay from when the first,66.159,6.401,72.56,sad
manifestations occurred,69.92,6.8,76.72,sad
until the the correct diagnosis was made,72.56,7.04,79.60000000000001,sad
i think the recent literature shows some,76.72,3.84,80.56,sad
progress,79.6,4.159,83.759,sad
that there is a delay that um of,80.56,6.8,87.36,sad
only about five or ten years but this,83.759,6.641,90.4,sad
i think anyone would agree that is still,87.36,6.16,93.52,sad
a very long time so the problem with,90.4,4.48,94.88000000000001,sad
having a,93.52,3.76,97.28,sad
delay between manifestations and,94.88,3.36,98.24,sad
diagnosis,97.28,4.08,101.36,sad
is that chronic exposure with high,98.24,4.0,102.24,sad
growth to grow,101.36,3.039,104.399,fear
high growth hormone levels would,102.24,3.6,105.83999999999999,sad
actually,104.399,5.121,109.52,sad
cause comorbidities complications,105.84,7.04,112.88000000000001,sad
things like cardiovascular,109.52,5.68,115.19999999999999,sad
changes from high blood pressure to,112.88,4.279,117.15899999999999,sad
heart problems,115.2,5.919,121.119,sad
hyperglycemia changes in,117.159,7.32,124.47900000000001,sad
the bones and during this time the tumor,121.119,5.201,126.32,sad
has time to grow,124.479,5.84,130.319,sad
and become more invasive,126.32,6.16,132.48,sad
and more difficult to remove in its,130.319,4.0,134.319,sad
entirety,132.48,5.68,138.16,sad
by the neurosurgeon so,134.319,6.961,141.28,sad
in my practice as a as a,138.16,6.56,144.72,sad
pituitary specialist of more than,141.28,7.599,148.879,sad
20 years i have started to,144.72,8.799,153.519,sad
think and to educate people,148.879,7.841,156.72,sad
in a different fashion we shouldn't be,153.519,3.921,157.44,sad
waiting,156.72,3.519,160.239,fear
until anyone is able to make this,157.44,4.4,161.84,fear
diagnosis,160.239,5.041,165.28,sad
we should instead look for a cluster,161.84,7.28,169.12,sad
of characteristic manifestations,165.28,7.28,172.56,sad
such as increased sweating carpal tunnel,169.12,4.479,173.59900000000002,sad
syndrome,172.56,3.759,176.319,happy
and that may be in conjunction with um,173.599,4.56,178.159,NA
other things that are actually,176.319,4.801,181.11999999999998,NA
common in the general population such as,178.159,4.481,182.64,NA
hypertension,181.12,5.92,187.04,NA
or joint pain or hypoglycemia,182.64,7.76,190.39999999999998,NA
i think if we look at a combination,187.04,7.04,194.07999999999998,NA
of suggestive manifestations and,190.4,6.64,197.04,NA
symptoms we would make the diagnosis,194.08,4.159,198.239,NA
sooner,197.04,4.0,201.04,NA
and with this bring the patient to the,198.239,4.321,202.56,NA
correct,201.04,4.08,205.12,NA
to the to the correct physician and have,202.56,4.48,207.04,NA
the correct treatment,205.12,8.0,213.12,NA
um sooner than before,207.04,8.16,215.2,NA
you,213.12,2.08,215.20000000000002,NA
