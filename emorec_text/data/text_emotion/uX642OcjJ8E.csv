[Music] acromegaly is thought of as a rare disease with very specific characteristic manifestations,0.96,30.680999999999997,31.641,angry
these manifestations can include changes in the way the patients look so coarsening of their features increased in the size of the tongue teeth,16.16,24.799999999999997,40.959999999999994,angry
shifting and enlargement of the hands and feet which is what we call acronym enlargement the problem was looking at acromegaly,28.72,23.958999999999996,52.678999999999995,neutral
in this fashion as a disease with pathognomonic features is that these features develop slowly over the course of years which tends to delay the diagnosis,40.399,31.0,71.399,neutral
by more than five years in the past it was actually more than 10 years that a patient would experience in terms of a delay from when the first manifestations occurred,56.32,33.601,89.92099999999999,neutral
until the the correct diagnosis was made i think the recent literature shows some progress that there is a delay that um of only about five or ten years but this,72.56,28.479999999999997,101.03999999999999,neutral
i think anyone would agree that is still a very long time so the problem with having a delay between manifestations and diagnosis,87.36,21.840000000000003,109.2,neutral
is that chronic exposure with high growth to grow high growth hormone levels would actually cause comorbidities complications,98.24,22.8,121.03999999999999,neutral
things like cardiovascular changes from high blood pressure to heart problems hyperglycemia changes in the bones and during this time the tumor,109.52,28.399,137.91899999999998,neutral
has time to grow and become more invasive and more difficult to remove in its entirety by the neurosurgeon so,124.479,28.641,153.12,neutral
in my practice as a as a pituitary specialist of more than 20 years i have started to think and to educate people in a different fashion we shouldn't be,138.16,34.72,172.88,neutral
waiting until anyone is able to make this diagnosis we should instead look for a cluster of characteristic manifestations,156.72,27.520000000000003,184.24,neutral
such as increased sweating carpal tunnel syndrome and that may be in conjunction with um other things that are actually common in the general population such as,169.12,22.08,191.2,angry
hypertension or joint pain or hypoglycemia i think if we look at a combination of suggestive manifestations and symptoms we would make the diagnosis,181.12,31.519,212.639,NA
sooner and with this bring the patient to the correct to the to the correct physician and have the correct treatment,197.04,24.881,221.921,NA
um sooner than before you,207.04,10.24,217.28,NA
