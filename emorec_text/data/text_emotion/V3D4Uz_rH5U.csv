hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I want to share with you two very very important indexes the glycemic index versus the insulin index now I'm just going to pretend you've never even heard,0.8,22.539,23.339000000000002,angry
about this one so just to keep it really basic so the glycemic index is the scale of foods that has influence over your blood Sugar's within two to three hours so there's certain foods like jelly,12.509,26.400000000000002,38.909000000000006,angry
beans for example that you eat that you trigger a lot of sugar response or a lot of sugar in your blood it spikes up okay and so that would be very high in the scale but eating celery which is a,25.56,24.060000000000002,49.620000000000005,angry
carbohydrate does not create that same effect okay that would be low on the scale and that's the glycemic index it has to do with how fast carbohydrates or sugars turn into or affect the blood,37.469,21.81,59.278999999999996,sad
sugars okay and you have different things to alter that like like a fiber you know how much sugar that it's in that carbohydrate that type of thing then the insulin index is all those non,48.449,27.191000000000003,75.64,angry
carbohydrate foods that affect insulin okay so in other words when you eat sugar you trigger insulin but there are other foods that you eat that won't necessarily they're not sugary foods but,61.55,27.110000000000003,88.66,angry
they do trigger insulin okay so we're going to explain that now here's the thing insulin is the hormone that regulates blood sugars it tends to lower blood sugars in the presence of insulin,75.0,23.61,98.61,sad
it's almost impossible to lose weight so our goal is to have a low insulin low sugar situation okay so check this out so we have the glycemic index so really high in the scale would be like just,87.36,24.35,111.71000000000001,sad
plain sugar and then potato is very high in the scale so this turns into sugar really fast white bread is high whole wheat bread is is just like a point less it's not any it's almost equivalent so,99.02,29.799999999999997,128.82,angry
if you're thinking you're eating whole wheat bread and it's not turning into sugar very fast it's actually very high in the scale I think it's like 74 so it's pretty high so now low on the list,114.93,21.329,136.25900000000001,angry
and by the way I created links below so you can see the whole scale on both of these scales so that's why I didn't want to write it out so we have lonely list peanuts is very low,125.07,17.64,142.70999999999998,angry
think it's like a it's like a 14 something like that so that's pretty low and then hummus is a six so hummus would be a very low glycemic thing to consume good snack to eat okay so that's just,134.069,27.209,161.278,angry
kind of that now let's take a look at this insulin index and this might surprise you very high in the list is whey protein powder so whey protein is very low fat very lean and that will,147.269,29.580000000000002,176.84900000000002,angry
trigger insulin pretty high and then we even have lean beef will also trigger insulin okay now this is kind of goes against what you've been told but that's very high in the scale and then as we go,162.269,24.991,187.26,angry
down with egg whites because it's less fat is higher than the list egg yolks are lower on the list it creates less of an insulin response and then butter bacon is even lower so my point is when,174.48,30.6,205.07999999999998,angry
people are trying to lose weight what do they do they avoid the fat and what do they eat more protein but they have to understand the scale right here fat actually will buffer and lower the,190.56,25.108999999999998,215.669,sad
insulin of effect so if you were going to have some beef make sure it has some fat in it because fat is one of the things that is almost neutral when it comes down to insulin and it doesn't,202.379,26.192,228.571,sad
turn into sugar yes it has calories but it doesn't create the effect on insulin so it's great for diabetics so here's the confusing part if protein triggers insulin which is a fat making hormone,215.37,21.899,237.269,sad
then why do people lose weight on protein okay and that is because these proteins also trigger the fat burning hormones like glucagon and growth hormone okay so that's why that can work,226.799,32.519999999999996,259.319,NA
but the thing to remember is that we want to keep in something low to actually enhance the weight loss process so if you were going to have protein don't go so lean add some fat to it make,241.949,24.809,266.75800000000004,NA
sure it's not so low fat if you're going to have eggs have the whole eggs not just the egg whites and I think you're going to lose more weight and you're actually going to be healthier doing,255.239,16.561,271.8,NA
that okay so I just wanted to kind of summarize what these indexes are and I have the links below so you can go ahead and study those and go ahead and apply this information the,263.669,20.72,284.389,NA
goal is to keep insulin low and it just so happens that the only foods that don't really trigger insulin that much are the fats the exact foods that people have been avoiding,273.729,22.208999999999996,295.938,NA
