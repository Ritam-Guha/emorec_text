hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I,0.8,4.78,5.58,sad
want to share with you two very very,3.36,4.89,8.25,surprise
important indexes the glycemic index,5.58,5.49,11.07,surprise
versus the insulin index now I'm just,8.25,4.259,12.509,surprise
going to pretend you've never even heard,11.07,3.12,14.190000000000001,surprise
about this one so just to keep it really,12.509,5.61,18.119,surprise
basic so the glycemic index is the scale,14.19,7.349,21.539,surprise
of foods that has influence over your,18.119,5.461,23.58,surprise
blood Sugar's within two to three hours,21.539,4.021,25.560000000000002,surprise
so there's certain foods like jelly,23.58,3.959,27.538999999999998,sad
beans for example that you eat that you,25.56,5.16,30.72,sad
trigger a lot of sugar response or a lot,27.539,5.101,32.64,fear
of sugar in your blood it spikes up okay,30.72,4.14,34.86,fear
and so that would be very high in the,32.64,4.829,37.469,fear
scale but eating celery which is a,34.86,4.83,39.69,fear
carbohydrate does not create that same,37.469,3.75,41.219,fear
effect okay that would be low on the,39.69,3.689,43.379,fear
scale and that's the glycemic index it,41.219,5.101,46.32,fear
has to do with how fast carbohydrates or,43.379,5.07,48.449,fear
sugars turn into or affect the blood,46.32,4.2,50.52,sad
sugars okay and you have different,48.449,5.04,53.489,fear
things to alter that like like a fiber,50.52,5.609,56.129000000000005,fear
you know how much sugar that it's in,53.489,4.71,58.199,fear
that carbohydrate that type of thing,56.129,5.421,61.55,fear
then the insulin index is all those non,58.199,6.411,64.61,fear
carbohydrate foods that affect insulin,61.55,6.28,67.83,fear
okay so in other words when you eat,64.61,5.32,69.93,fear
sugar you trigger insulin but there are,67.83,3.6,71.42999999999999,fear
other foods that you eat that won't,69.93,5.07,75.0,fear
necessarily they're not sugary foods but,71.43,6.84,78.27000000000001,sad
they do trigger insulin okay so we're,75.0,5.28,80.28,fear
going to explain that now here's the,78.27,3.75,82.02,fear
thing insulin is the hormone that,80.28,4.049,84.32900000000001,fear
regulates blood sugars it tends to lower,82.02,5.34,87.36,sad
blood sugars in the presence of insulin,84.329,5.191,89.52,fear
it's almost impossible to lose weight so,87.36,4.799,92.159,fear
our goal is to have a low insulin low,89.52,4.95,94.47,fear
sugar situation okay so check this out,92.159,4.411,96.57000000000001,fear
so we have the glycemic index so really,94.47,4.55,99.02,fear
high in the scale would be like just,96.57,5.64,102.21,fear
plain sugar and then potato is very high,99.02,4.87,103.89,fear
in the scale so this turns into sugar,102.21,5.67,107.88,fear
really fast white bread is high whole,103.89,8.04,111.93,fear
wheat bread is is just like a point less,107.88,7.05,114.92999999999999,fear
it's not any it's almost equivalent so,111.93,4.17,116.10000000000001,fear
if you're thinking you're eating whole,114.93,2.939,117.869,fear
wheat bread and it's not turning into,116.1,3.39,119.49,NA
sugar very fast it's actually very high,117.869,4.92,122.789,sad
in the scale I think it's like 74 so,119.49,5.58,125.07,fear
it's pretty high so now low on the list,122.789,4.5,127.289,fear
and by the way I created links below so,125.07,4.35,129.42,fear
you can see the whole scale on both of,127.289,3.841,131.13,NA
these scales so that's why I didn't want,129.42,3.42,132.83999999999997,fear
to write it out so we have lonely list,131.13,2.939,134.069,fear
peanuts is very low,132.84,3.09,135.93,fear
think it's like a it's like a 14,134.069,3.331,137.39999999999998,fear
something like that so that's pretty low,135.93,5.52,141.45000000000002,fear
and then hummus is a six so hummus would,137.4,7.05,144.45000000000002,fear
be a very low glycemic thing to consume,141.45,5.819,147.26899999999998,fear
good snack to eat okay so that's just,144.45,5.489,149.939,fear
kind of that now let's take a look at,147.269,4.83,152.09900000000002,fear
this insulin index and this might,149.939,5.371,155.31,fear
surprise you very high in the list is,152.099,7.021,159.11999999999998,fear
whey protein powder so whey protein is,155.31,6.959,162.269,fear
very low fat very lean and that will,159.12,5.399,164.519,fear
trigger insulin pretty high and then we,162.269,4.08,166.34900000000002,fear
even have lean beef will also trigger,164.519,5.431,169.95000000000002,fear
insulin okay now this is kind of goes,166.349,6.06,172.409,fear
against what you've been told but that's,169.95,4.53,174.48,fear
very high in the scale and then as we go,172.409,4.89,177.29899999999998,fear
down with egg whites because it's less,174.48,6.239,180.719,fear
fat is higher than the list egg yolks,177.299,5.97,183.269,fear
are lower on the list it creates less of,180.719,4.261,184.98,fear
an insulin response and then butter,183.269,7.291,190.56,fear
bacon is even lower so my point is when,184.98,6.839,191.819,fear
people are trying to lose weight what do,190.56,4.049,194.609,fear
they do they avoid the fat and what do,191.819,5.31,197.129,fear
they eat more protein but they have to,194.609,4.71,199.31900000000002,fear
understand the scale right here fat,197.129,5.25,202.379,fear
actually will buffer and lower the,199.319,5.79,205.10899999999998,fear
insulin of effect so if you were going,202.379,4.771,207.14999999999998,fear
to have some beef make sure it has some,205.109,4.681,209.79000000000002,fear
fat in it because fat is one of the,207.15,6.089,213.239,fear
things that is almost neutral when it,209.79,5.58,215.37,fear
comes down to insulin and it doesn't,213.239,5.071,218.31,fear
turn into sugar yes it has calories but,215.37,4.53,219.9,fear
it doesn't create the effect on insulin,218.31,3.78,222.09,fear
so it's great for diabetics so here's,219.9,4.589,224.489,fear
the confusing part if protein triggers,222.09,4.709,226.799,fear
insulin which is a fat making hormone,224.489,4.291,228.78,fear
then why do people lose weight on,226.799,5.46,232.25900000000001,surprise
protein okay and that is because these,228.78,7.019,235.799,NA
proteins also trigger the fat burning,232.259,6.991,239.25,NA
hormones like glucagon and growth,235.799,6.15,241.949,NA
hormone okay so that's why that can work,239.25,6.9,246.15,NA
but the thing to remember is that we,241.949,5.671,247.62,NA
want to keep in something low to,246.15,2.85,249.0,NA
actually enhance the weight loss process,247.62,3.799,251.419,NA
so if you were going to have protein,249.0,6.239,255.239,NA
don't go so lean add some fat to it make,251.419,6.25,257.669,NA
sure it's not so low fat if you're going,255.239,3.96,259.199,NA
to have eggs have the whole eggs not,257.669,3.87,261.539,NA
just the egg whites and I think you're,259.199,3.421,262.62,NA
going to lose more weight and you're,261.539,2.13,263.669,NA
actually going to be healthier doing,262.62,3.18,265.8,NA
that okay so I just wanted to kind of,263.669,3.791,267.46,NA
summarize what these,265.8,3.97,269.77000000000004,NA
indexes are and I have the links below,267.46,4.019,271.479,NA
so you can go ahead and study those and,269.77,3.959,273.729,NA
go ahead and apply this information the,271.479,4.981,276.46,NA
goal is to keep insulin low and it just,273.729,5.25,278.979,NA
so happens that the only foods that,276.46,4.26,280.71999999999997,NA
don't really trigger insulin that much,278.979,4.771,283.75,NA
are the fats the exact foods that people,280.72,5.479,286.199,NA
have been avoiding,283.75,2.449,286.199,NA
