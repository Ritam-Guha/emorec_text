hello my name is dr. Simon Fraser consultants in clinical neurophysiology this video will provide you with an explanation of diabetic neuropathy what it is the different types and why,0.0,20.819999999999997,20.819999999999997,angry
patients develop them you can also find out more about current treatments by clicking on the information card above diabetes causes raise sugar levels in the blood this is called hyperglycemia,10.41,25.878,36.288,angry
hyperglycemia over prolonged periods of time is associated with blood vessel disease when it affects the large blood vessels it causes what we call the microvascular complications of diabetes,23.539,21.902,45.441,angry
this is where it can cause clogging of the large arteries to the heart where it predisposes to heart attacks causing clogging of the large arteries of the brain where it can predispose to strokes,34.1,21.67,55.77,angry
and causing clogging of the large arteries so the legs and arms where it can cause peripheral vascular disease when it affects the smaller blood vessels it causes what we call the,45.48,18.92,64.4,angry
microvascular complications of diabetes namely damage to the structures in the kidney causing nephropathy damage to the structures in the eye causing retinopathy and damage to the structures,54.51,25.75,80.25999999999999,angry
of the nerves causing neuropathy this video will focus on diabetic neuropathy ie the nerve damage caused by diabetes firstly some statistics diabetes is really common and in 2014 it's affected,66.84,29.85,96.69,angry
3.5 million patients in the UK with this number steadily rising diabetic neuropathy will affect around fifty to sixty percent of diabetics twenty five percent of diabetics will have this as a,82.2,23.7,105.9,angry
painful neuropathy around fifty percent will have autonomic fibre involvement causing impaired bowel movements for example and for many men at least a third erectile dysfunction these,94.14,23.22,117.36,angry
complications are mainly time-dependent so the longer patients have diabetes the more susceptible they become in developing these complications they are also blood sugar level dependent so,105.99,18.599,124.589,angry
poorly controlled diabetics are more likely to develop some of these conditions many patients do not recognize the symptoms of this and can present with further problems such as,115.53,21.18,136.71,angry
foot ulcers and gangrene thus we really need to understand this condition detect it early prevent its progress and treat it effectively to prevent worst complications from occurring when,125.549,24.271,149.82,angry
we think about diabetic neuropathy we need to understand both the mechanisms of this condition and the different types of patterns of nerve damage that it can cause this can help us determine,138.0,22.198999999999998,160.199,angry
the underlying mechanism of the neuropathy and target treatment accordingly you can find a link to my overview of all of these different conditions posted on my wordpress site,148.59,21.69,170.28,angry
by clicking the link in the information box below so let's try and understand the most important mechanism metabolic microvascular hypoxia or MMH for short nerves are living tissues I need oxygen,160.319,28.830999999999996,189.14999999999998,angry
to survive they have tiny arteries called the Vezina forum which pump blood laden with oxygen to them raise blood Sugar's bind to structures and proteins in the artery walls in a process called,173.97,27.099000000000004,201.06900000000002,angry
glycosylation and causes them to thicken this is called diabetic microangiopathy because oxygen has to diffuse across the walls of the blood vessels to make its way into the nerve cell tissue beneath,187.069,27.08,214.149,angry
any increase in blood vessel thickness will impair the transfer of oxygen this causes hypoxia a lack of oxygen to the tissue which ultimately leads to nerve damage and death in addition excess,201.48,22.320999999999998,223.801,angry
sugars are absorbed into the cell walls of nerve fibers are not converted but the polyol pal throw into sucrose and fructose this sin causes excess fluids to be drawn into the cells by process,212.73,22.049,234.779,angry
called osmotic pressure swooned cells become enlarged and dysfunctional which leads to further nerve tissue damage and impairment of transmitting nerve signals smaller nerves tend to be more,223.35,20.881,244.231,angry
susceptible to these processes and so painful small fiber neuropathy are more common we also often see a length dependent process this is where the more distant nerves which are very thin as a,234.09,24.359,258.449,angry
taper off become more affected as they're more susceptible hence feet tend to be affected more often and before the hands the type of damage diabetes causes usually affects the axons are you the,246.15,23.459999999999997,269.61,angry
wire core of the nerve it can also affect the myelin sheath as well and this is particularly the case in controlled diabetes diabetes can also cause activation of the immune system to,257.94,21.221000000000004,279.161,angry
inflict damage on the nerves by mechanisms we don't fully understand these can cause inflammatory conditions such as cidp painful diabetic neuropathy with extreme weight loss and contribute,268.82,23.13,291.95,angry
to the development of diabetic Black Sabbath II and cranial nerve palsies nerves can also become more susceptible to compression your apathy s such as carpal tunnel syndrome cubital tunnel,280.37,21.21,301.58,angry
syndrome common peroneal nerve compression across the feeble your neck and morale repair aesthetica mechanisms for this include linkage to obesity increased nerve fragility and fibrous,290.87,25.95,316.82,NA
deposition causing reduced mobility of the nerves across the joints nerves can also become damaged following complications of diabetes slightly short term complications such as hypoglycemic,303.8,20.73,324.53000000000003,NA
events or diabetic ketoacidosis this is thought to arise either from a relatively transient metabolic dysfunction or from small clots blocking up the vision of orem additionally they,313.82,19.26,333.08,NA
can also be caused by more long-term complications such as diabetic kidney failure a very rare complication can also transiently arise following commencement of insulin and this is,324.11,22.14,346.25,NA
called incident i right asst but fortunately tends to self resolve after a few months this slide summarizes the different patterns of nerve involvement and mechanisms we believe caused them,335.09,20.790000000000003,355.88,NA
