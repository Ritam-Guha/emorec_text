hello my name is dr. Simon Fraser,0.0,4.31,4.31,angry
consultants in clinical neurophysiology,2.37,4.23,6.6000000000000005,angry
this video will provide you with an,4.31,4.63,8.94,angry
explanation of diabetic neuropathy what,6.6,3.81,10.41,angry
it is the different types and why,8.94,3.84,12.78,angry
patients develop them you can also find,10.41,4.5,14.91,angry
out more about current treatments by,12.78,5.06,17.84,angry
clicking on the information card above,14.91,5.879,20.789,angry
diabetes causes raise sugar levels in,17.84,5.699,23.539,angry
the blood this is called hyperglycemia,20.789,4.74,25.529000000000003,angry
hyperglycemia over prolonged periods of,23.539,3.971,27.51,angry
time is associated with blood vessel,25.529,4.441,29.97,angry
disease when it affects the large blood,27.51,4.109,31.619,angry
vessels it causes what we call the,29.97,4.13,34.1,angry
microvascular complications of diabetes,31.619,5.251,36.87,angry
this is where it can cause clogging of,34.1,5.26,39.36,angry
the large arteries to the heart where it,36.87,4.89,41.76,angry
predisposes to heart attacks causing,39.36,3.81,43.17,angry
clogging of the large arteries of the,41.76,3.72,45.48,angry
brain where it can predispose to strokes,43.17,3.99,47.160000000000004,angry
and causing clogging of the large,45.48,3.45,48.93,angry
arteries so the legs and arms where it,47.16,3.68,50.839999999999996,angry
can cause peripheral vascular disease,48.93,4.05,52.98,angry
when it affects the smaller blood,50.84,3.67,54.510000000000005,angry
vessels it causes what we call the,52.98,4.07,57.05,angry
microvascular complications of diabetes,54.51,5.189,59.699,angry
namely damage to the structures in the,57.05,5.439,62.489,angry
kidney causing nephropathy damage to the,59.699,4.29,63.989,angry
structures in the eye causing,62.489,4.351,66.84,angry
retinopathy and damage to the structures,63.989,6.481,70.47,angry
of the nerves causing neuropathy this,66.84,5.91,72.75,angry
video will focus on diabetic neuropathy,70.47,5.18,75.65,angry
ie the nerve damage caused by diabetes,72.75,5.909,78.659,angry
firstly some statistics diabetes is,75.65,6.55,82.2,angry
really common and in 2014 it's affected,78.659,6.301,84.96000000000001,angry
3.5 million patients in the UK with this,82.2,5.34,87.54,angry
number steadily rising diabetic,84.96,4.56,89.52,angry
neuropathy will affect around fifty to,87.54,4.59,92.13000000000001,angry
sixty percent of diabetics twenty five,89.52,4.62,94.14,angry
percent of diabetics will have this as a,92.13,4.59,96.72,angry
painful neuropathy around fifty percent,94.14,4.74,98.88,angry
will have autonomic fibre involvement,96.72,4.02,100.74,angry
causing impaired bowel movements for,98.88,3.69,102.57,angry
example and for many men at least a,100.74,5.25,105.99,angry
third erectile dysfunction these,102.57,5.52,108.08999999999999,angry
complications are mainly time-dependent,105.99,4.169,110.15899999999999,angry
so the longer patients have diabetes the,108.09,3.419,111.509,angry
more susceptible they become in,110.159,3.42,113.57900000000001,angry
developing these complications they are,111.509,4.021,115.53,angry
also blood sugar level dependent so,113.579,3.57,117.14899999999999,angry
poorly controlled diabetics are more,115.53,3.42,118.95,angry
likely to develop some of these,117.149,4.891,122.04,angry
conditions many patients do not,118.95,5.16,124.11,angry
recognize the symptoms of this and can,122.04,3.509,125.549,angry
present with further problems such as,124.11,4.2,128.31,angry
foot ulcers and gangrene thus we really,125.549,4.68,130.229,angry
need to understand this condition detect,128.31,3.72,132.03,angry
it early prevent its progress,130.229,4.261,134.49,angry
and treat it effectively to prevent,132.03,5.97,138.0,angry
worst complications from occurring when,134.49,5.64,140.13,angry
we think about diabetic neuropathy we,138.0,3.75,141.75,angry
need to understand both the mechanisms,140.13,3.42,143.54999999999998,angry
of this condition and the different,141.75,3.87,145.62,angry
types of patterns of nerve damage that,143.55,5.04,148.59,angry
it can cause this can help us determine,145.62,6.119,151.739,angry
the underlying mechanism of the,148.59,5.19,153.78,angry
neuropathy and target treatment,151.739,5.101,156.84,angry
accordingly you can find a link to my,153.78,4.32,158.1,angry
overview of all of these different,156.84,3.479,160.31900000000002,angry
conditions posted on my wordpress site,158.1,3.6,161.7,angry
by clicking the link in the information,160.319,4.981,165.29999999999998,angry
box below so let's try and understand,161.7,6.18,167.88,angry
the most important mechanism metabolic,165.3,6.02,171.32000000000002,angry
microvascular hypoxia or MMH for short,167.88,6.09,173.97,angry
nerves are living tissues I need oxygen,171.32,5.56,176.88,angry
to survive they have tiny arteries,173.97,5.7,179.67,angry
called the Vezina forum which pump blood,176.88,5.85,182.73,angry
laden with oxygen to them raise blood,179.67,5.22,184.89,angry
Sugar's bind to structures and proteins,182.73,4.339,187.069,angry
in the artery walls in a process called,184.89,5.99,190.88,angry
glycosylation and causes them to thicken,187.069,7.621,194.69,angry
this is called diabetic microangiopathy,190.88,6.46,197.34,angry
because oxygen has to diffuse across the,194.69,4.42,199.10999999999999,angry
walls of the blood vessels to make its,197.34,4.14,201.48,angry
way into the nerve cell tissue beneath,199.11,4.439,203.549,angry
any increase in blood vessel thickness,201.48,4.5,205.98,angry
will impair the transfer of oxygen this,203.549,5.101,208.65,angry
causes hypoxia a lack of oxygen to the,205.98,4.56,210.54,angry
tissue which ultimately leads to nerve,208.65,4.08,212.73000000000002,angry
damage and death in addition excess,210.54,4.08,214.62,angry
sugars are absorbed into the cell walls,212.73,4.11,216.84,angry
of nerve fibers are not converted but,214.62,4.29,218.91,angry
the polyol pal throw into sucrose and,216.84,4.59,221.43,angry
fructose this sin causes excess fluids,218.91,4.44,223.35,angry
to be drawn into the cells by process,221.43,4.619,226.049,angry
called osmotic pressure swooned cells,223.35,4.65,228.0,angry
become enlarged and dysfunctional which,226.049,3.631,229.68,angry
leads to further nerve tissue damage and,228.0,4.04,232.04,angry
impairment of transmitting nerve signals,229.68,4.41,234.09,angry
smaller nerves tend to be more,232.04,4.15,236.19,angry
susceptible to these processes and so,234.09,4.05,238.14000000000001,angry
painful small fiber neuropathy are more,236.19,4.95,241.14,angry
common we also often see a length,238.14,5.58,243.72,angry
dependent process this is where the more,241.14,5.01,246.14999999999998,angry
distant nerves which are very thin as a,243.72,4.769,248.489,angry
taper off become more affected as,246.15,4.8,250.95000000000002,angry
they're more susceptible hence feet tend,248.489,4.411,252.9,angry
to be affected more often and before the,250.95,4.59,255.54,angry
hands the type of damage diabetes causes,252.9,5.04,257.94,angry
usually affects the axons are you the,255.54,4.619,260.159,angry
wire core of the nerve it can also,257.94,3.96,261.9,angry
affect the myelin sheath as well and,260.159,3.411,263.57,angry
this is particularly the case in,261.9,4.61,266.51,angry
controlled diabetes diabetes can also,263.57,5.25,268.82,angry
cause activation of the immune system to,266.51,3.99,270.5,angry
inflict damage on the nerves by,268.82,3.56,272.38,angry
mechanisms we don't fully understand,270.5,4.8,275.3,angry
these can cause inflammatory conditions,272.38,5.83,278.21,angry
such as cidp painful diabetic neuropathy,275.3,5.07,280.37,angry
with extreme weight loss and contribute,278.21,3.87,282.08,angry
to the development of diabetic Black,280.37,4.25,284.62,angry
Sabbath II and cranial nerve palsies,282.08,4.8,286.88,angry
