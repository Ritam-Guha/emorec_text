hello hi I want to talk to you today about two vitamins that are important for many women with PCOS that's vitamin b12 and vitamin D now this information is just for you to take with you and try,0.53,30.728999999999996,31.258999999999997,happy
to fit in to your own health puzzle with all supplements I recommend that you take this information and present it to your doctor or another healthcare provider like a nutritionist or a,15.509,19.981,35.49,happy
naturopath or do more research on your own so you make sure that these choices are right for you this is general information to help you get started okay so let's move on to vitamin b12 so why I,25.59,30.779,56.369,happy
think that this is an important vitamin for women with PCOS to be aware of it is because long-term use of metformin the drug that is commonly prescribed to them with PCOS for insulin resistance it has,41.46,26.911,68.37100000000001,happy
been shown again and again to cause low vitamin b12 and people who use it long term and some birth control pills also cause low vitamin b12 particularly when it's in combination with metformin so if,54.51,32.339,86.84899999999999,happy
you are on metformin it's my recommendation that you ask your doctor to check you annually every year to see if you have low b12 if you find it you have low b12 or your physician things,71.189,24.660000000000004,95.84899999999999,happy
that you should go ahead and start supplementing with it since you're taking metformin you can start usually with just a hundred a hundred percent of the daily recommended value one thing to,83.909,26.009999999999998,109.91900000000001,happy
be aware of is that some people have what's called the nth F R gene variant it's a complicated thing that I'm not I'm gonna get into right now it's just to know that you may have trouble,96.329,29.659,125.988,happy
breaking down vitamins in particular b12 is one of them if you have this gene variant I happen to have it myself so when I tested positive for that my physician put me on a methylated b12,110.479,24.732,135.211,happy
supplement that was appropriate for my level of b12 deficiency okay moving on to vitamin D so vitamin D is a tricky one because you can't get it from your diet,123.45,26.419999999999995,149.87,happy
you have to get it from sun exposure and most of us aren't getting a whole lot of sun exposure maybe if you're unlike a surf instructor you're getting some sun exposure but anyway in some research 67,136.59,31.448999999999998,168.039,happy
to 85 percent of women with PCOS were found to be vitamin D deficient and that's a problem because low vitamin D is associated with fertility problems cardiovascular disease her Sioux ISM,152.069,30.620999999999995,182.69,happy
insulin resistance so if you are low in vitamin D you could be aggravating all of those problems that already come along with having PCOS in fact some studies have seen that women's with PCOS,166.91,26.44,193.35,happy
see an improvement in their pursue ISM infertility and cardiovascular factors when they start taking a vitamin D supplement now as far as I can tell in the research there's no like one,180.6,29.329,209.929,happy
particular vitamin D dosage for PCOS right now a lot of people at experts are kind of thinking that the daily recommended value that we have currently in the supplement industry isn't high,194.1,28.301,222.40099999999998,happy
"enough and so I'm reading just in my own research that a good place to start is about 2,000 international units of vitamin D particularly d3 and with all vitamins you want to look for vitamins",209.22,33.57,242.79,happy
from reputable sources that are either NSF or GMP certified those are consumer watchdogs for supplements so they test the purity of a supplement to brands that I recommend or Sarah logics which I,226.65,26.849999999999998,253.5,NA
have a brand partnership I love their brand and another brand that I've been happy with it so available sometimes on Amazon is pure encapsulations both of those brands,240.18,20.9,261.08,NA
have multiple levels of quality control so that you can trust what you're getting okay so vitamin b12 and vitamin D it's probably a good idea to get yourself,250.48,19.11,269.59,NA
checked annually for your levels especially if you're taking metformin and birth control pills you might even want to look into whether or not you have the nth fr gene variant and you can,260.44,23.94,284.38,NA
actually take a test on the 23andme comm for that if you want to all right go forth and choose your supplements wisely ladies,271.93,19.3,291.23,NA
