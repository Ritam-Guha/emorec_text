hello hi I want to talk to you today,0.53,4.96,5.49,happy
about two vitamins that are important,3.0,5.49,8.49,happy
for many women with PCOS that's vitamin,5.49,6.569,12.059000000000001,happy
b12 and vitamin D now this information,8.49,7.019,15.509,happy
is just for you to take with you and try,12.059,6.691,18.75,happy
to fit in to your own health puzzle with,15.509,5.43,20.939,happy
all supplements I recommend that you,18.75,3.72,22.47,happy
take this information and present it to,20.939,3.121,24.06,happy
your doctor or another healthcare,22.47,3.12,25.59,happy
provider like a nutritionist or a,24.06,4.59,28.65,happy
naturopath or do more research on your,25.59,5.88,31.47,happy
own so you make sure that these choices,28.65,5.28,33.93,happy
are right for you this is general,31.47,5.85,37.32,happy
information to help you get started okay,33.93,7.53,41.46,happy
so let's move on to vitamin b12 so why I,37.32,6.239,43.559,happy
think that this is an important vitamin,41.46,4.079,45.539,happy
for women with PCOS to be aware of it is,43.559,6.18,49.739,happy
because long-term use of metformin the,45.539,6.121,51.660000000000004,happy
drug that is commonly prescribed to them,49.739,4.771,54.51,happy
with PCOS for insulin resistance it has,51.66,5.76,57.419999999999995,happy
been shown again and again to cause low,54.51,5.639,60.149,happy
vitamin b12 and people who use it long,57.42,6.84,64.26,happy
term and some birth control pills also,60.149,7.83,67.979,happy
cause low vitamin b12 particularly when,64.26,6.929,71.18900000000001,happy
it's in combination with metformin so if,67.979,5.101,73.08,happy
you are on metformin it's my,71.189,3.511,74.69999999999999,happy
recommendation that you ask your doctor,73.08,4.2,77.28,happy
to check you annually every year to see,74.7,7.11,81.81,happy
if you have low b12 if you find it you,77.28,6.629,83.909,happy
have low b12 or your physician things,81.81,3.21,85.02,happy
that you should go ahead and start,83.909,2.431,86.34,happy
supplementing with it since you're,85.02,4.889,89.90899999999999,happy
taking metformin you can start usually,86.34,6.989,93.32900000000001,happy
with just a hundred a hundred percent of,89.909,6.42,96.32900000000001,happy
the daily recommended value one thing to,93.329,5.281,98.61,happy
be aware of is that some people have,96.329,6.65,102.979,happy
what's called the nth F R gene variant,98.61,6.84,105.45,happy
it's a complicated thing that I'm not,102.979,4.661,107.64,happy
I'm gonna get into right now it's just,105.45,5.029,110.479,happy
to know that you may have trouble,107.64,6.479,114.119,happy
breaking down vitamins in particular b12,110.479,5.831,116.31,happy
is one of them if you have this gene,114.119,4.741,118.86,happy
variant I happen to have it myself so,116.31,4.199,120.509,happy
when I tested positive for that my,118.86,4.59,123.45,happy
physician put me on a methylated b12,120.509,5.371,125.88,happy
supplement that was appropriate for my,123.45,2.97,126.42,happy
level,125.88,6.06,131.94,happy
of b12 deficiency okay moving on to,126.42,8.34,134.76,happy
vitamin D so vitamin D is a tricky one,131.94,4.65,136.59,happy
because you can't get it from your diet,134.76,4.4,139.16,happy
you have to get it from sun exposure and,136.59,5.13,141.72,happy
most of us aren't getting a whole lot of,139.16,5.409,144.569,happy
sun exposure maybe if you're unlike a,141.72,4.56,146.28,happy
surf instructor you're getting some sun,144.569,7.5,152.069,happy
exposure but anyway in some research 67,146.28,8.85,155.13,happy
to 85 percent of women with PCOS were,152.069,6.931,159.0,happy
found to be vitamin D deficient and,155.13,6.81,161.94,happy
that's a problem because low vitamin D,159.0,5.06,164.06,happy
is associated with fertility problems,161.94,4.97,166.91,happy
cardiovascular disease her Sioux ISM,164.06,6.85,170.91,happy
insulin resistance so if you are low in,166.91,7.48,174.39,happy
vitamin D you could be aggravating all,170.91,4.98,175.89,happy
of those problems that already come,174.39,4.2,178.58999999999997,happy
along with having PCOS in fact some,175.89,4.71,180.6,happy
studies have seen that women's with PCOS,178.59,5.07,183.66,happy
see an improvement in their pursue ISM,180.6,5.969,186.569,happy
infertility and cardiovascular factors,183.66,5.1,188.76,happy
when they start taking a vitamin D,186.569,5.581,192.14999999999998,happy
supplement now as far as I can tell in,188.76,5.34,194.1,happy
the research there's no like one,192.15,7.339,199.489,happy
particular vitamin D dosage for PCOS,194.1,8.79,202.89,happy
right now a lot of people at experts are,199.489,4.84,204.329,happy
kind of thinking that the daily,202.89,4.23,207.11999999999998,happy
recommended value that we have currently,204.329,4.891,209.22,happy
in the supplement industry isn't high,207.12,5.55,212.67000000000002,happy
enough and so I'm reading just in my own,209.22,5.91,215.13,happy
research that a good place to start is,212.67,6.12,218.79,happy
"about 2,000 international units of",215.13,9.389,224.519,happy
vitamin D particularly d3 and with all,218.79,7.86,226.65,happy
vitamins you want to look for vitamins,224.519,4.291,228.81,happy
from reputable sources that are either,226.65,6.45,233.1,NA
NSF or GMP certified those are consumer,228.81,6.959,235.769,NA
watchdogs for supplements so they test,233.1,4.949,238.049,NA
the purity of a supplement to brands,235.769,4.411,240.18,NA
that I recommend or Sarah logics which I,238.049,4.081,242.13,NA
have a brand partnership I love their,240.18,4.44,244.62,NA
brand and another brand that I've been,242.13,4.199,246.329,NA
happy with it so available sometimes on,244.62,4.5,249.12,NA
Amazon is pure encapsulations both of,246.329,4.151,250.48000000000002,NA
those brands,249.12,3.61,252.73000000000002,NA
have multiple levels of quality control,250.48,3.78,254.26,NA
so that you can trust what you're,252.73,3.149,255.879,NA
getting okay,254.26,4.74,259.0,NA
so vitamin b12 and vitamin D it's,255.879,4.561,260.44,NA
probably a good idea to get yourself,259.0,2.88,261.88,NA
checked annually for your levels,260.44,3.03,263.46999999999997,NA
especially if you're taking metformin,261.88,4.259,266.139,NA
and birth control pills you might even,263.47,4.23,267.70000000000005,NA
want to look into whether or not you,266.139,5.791,271.93,NA
have the nth fr gene variant and you can,267.7,6.63,274.33,NA
actually take a test on the 23andme comm,271.93,5.73,277.66,NA
for that if you want to all right,274.33,5.67,280.0,NA
go forth and choose your supplements,277.66,5.12,282.78000000000003,NA
wisely ladies,280.0,2.78,282.78,NA
