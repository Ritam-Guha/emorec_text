"And I'm going to talk about this week's Truth-O-Meter
Tuesday question.",11.519,3.75,15.269,sad
"The topic this week is BMI, or Body Mass Index.",15.269,4.891,20.16,sad
"Body Mass Index is a calculation that is made
on the basis of your height and weight that",20.16,5.171,25.331,sad
"will categorize you in terms of where you
are with your weight.",25.331,3.909,29.24,sad
"Either being underweight, at an ideal weight,
overweight, or significantly overweight--or",29.24,4.74,33.98,sad
obese.,33.98,1.0,34.98,sad
"Now we use this as a guide for who is a good
candidate for body contouring surgery because",34.98,5.219,40.199,sad
"body contouring surgery is not weight loss
surgery.",40.199,3.211,43.41,sad
"So the question we asked is this: You need
to have a Body Mass Index of 30 or less to",43.41,5.59,49.0,fear
be a good candidate for a tummy tuck or abdomiplasty.,49.0,4.73,53.730000000000004,sad
And the answer is True.,53.73,1.89,55.62,sad
"This is perhaps my preference, but I think
it's a good general guideline, that you should",55.62,4.45,60.07,sad
"be at a reasonable weight prior to body contouring
surgery and I use a Body Mass Index of 30",60.07,6.73,66.8,sad
as a cut off.,66.8,1.79,68.59,neutral
"Sometimes there's some wiggle room in there,
but the reason I do this is because the results",68.59,4.639,73.229,sad
"of the procedures are better
and they are safer if you are at a better,",73.229,6.071,79.3,sad
more healthy weight.,79.3,1.26,80.56,sad

my Body Mass Index is?""",82.75,3.72,86.47,sad
That's a very good question.,86.47,1.399,87.869,sad
"We put on our web page a calculator where
you put in your height and your weight and",87.869,4.931,92.8,sad
"it will show you what your Body Mass Index
is.",92.8,1.9,94.7,sad
"And it also gives you the guidelines of where
you want to be.",94.7,3.869,98.569,sad
"So if you're wondering what your Body Mass
Index is, go to our website, click on the",98.569,5.151,103.72,sad
"page for the Tummy Tuck, and you'll find it
there.",103.72,2.85,106.57,sad
