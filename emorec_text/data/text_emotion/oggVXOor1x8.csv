hey guys back with a new educational,0.03,5.039,5.069,happy
video and this week our content is,2.52,4.56,7.08,happy
coming from dr. Mark Hyman,5.069,4.981,10.05,happy
one of my favorite people on the,7.08,5.88,12.96,happy
interwebs actually he's not if you,10.05,3.509,13.559000000000001,happy
couldn't tell,12.96,4.98,17.94,happy
so Hyman likes to really stir the pot,13.559,6.001,19.56,happy
and say things that are pretty,17.94,5.7,23.64,happy
outlandish but that the average person,19.56,7.62,27.18,fear
buys into it's really kind of disturbing,23.64,6.32,29.96,
but he put up a post the other day that,27.18,5.75,32.93,
really made me laugh and the post was,29.96,5.05,35.01,
artificial sweetners trick your,32.93,4.21,37.14,
metabolism into thinking sugar is on its,35.01,4.619,39.629,
way this causes your body to pump out,37.14,4.5,41.64,
insulin the fat storage hormone which,39.629,4.95,44.579,happy
lays down more belly fat let's unpack,41.64,5.43,47.07,happy
that a little bit so first of all,44.579,5.311,49.89,fear
there's actually no research that I'm,47.07,3.509,50.579,fear
aware of,49.89,2.46,52.35,fear
showing that artificial sweeteners,50.579,4.351,54.93,fear
increase insulin there's been several,52.35,4.709,57.059,happy
studies looking at it none has shown,54.93,6.66,61.59,happy
this further if insulin was released in,57.059,7.201,64.25999999999999,happy
significant amounts from consuming,61.59,4.92,66.51,fear
artificial sweeteners then every time,64.26,4.2,68.46000000000001,fear
you drank a diet coke you would go,66.51,5.31,71.82000000000001,fear
hypoglycemic why because insulin,68.46,5.699,74.15899999999999,fear
responds to increases in blood glucose,71.82,5.939,77.75899999999999,fear
and insulin acts to drive glucose into,74.159,7.14,81.299,fear
cells and lower blood glucose so if your,77.759,5.911,83.67,happy
blood glucose does not elevate which,81.299,5.841,87.14,happy
would not happen from a diet coke then,83.67,6.629,90.299,fear
you're gonna go hypoglycemic because if,87.14,4.659,91.799,fear
insulin is released it's gonna drive,90.299,3.36,93.659,fear
down your blood sugar that doesn't,91.799,5.311,97.11000000000001,happy
happen so the only other option is if,93.659,6.301,99.96000000000001,happy
insulin went up that glucagon is also,97.11,4.829,101.939,fear
going up in concert glucagon acts in,99.96,4.32,104.28,fear
opposition to insulin but the great,101.939,4.11,106.04899999999999,happy
thing about glucagon is you don't have,104.28,3.06,107.34,happy
to worry about fat storage because,106.049,4.201,110.25,happy
glucagon increases lipolysis so anything,107.34,4.65,111.99000000000001,happy
that would be happy with insulin would,110.25,4.89,115.14,fear
be offset by glue gun but the research,111.99,5.159,117.149,happy
seems to show that artificial sweeteners,115.14,4.29,119.43,happy
don't really increase insulin and if we,117.149,5.82,122.969,fear
look at the long-term data straight up,119.43,6.21,125.64,fear
there was a study where they compared,122.969,4.801,127.77,fear
people who drank artificial sweeteners,125.64,6.29,131.93,fear
versus water okay so they had one,127.77,5.93,133.7,happy
just drink water they had another group,131.93,4.38,136.31,happy
that drank sugar or artificially,133.7,4.89,138.58999999999997,happy
sweetened beverages they actually found,136.31,3.81,140.12,fear
that the group that drank artificially,138.59,3.119,141.709,fear
sweetened beverages lost a little bit,140.12,3.839,143.959,happy
more body weight and body fat I'm not,141.709,3.961,145.67000000000002,happy
saying that these things are fat burners,143.959,4.021,147.98,happy
they are not that group probably,145.67,5.25,150.92,happy
consumed less calories for me and others,147.98,6.149,154.129,fear
I know that having a diet coke can be a,150.92,5.01,155.92999999999998,fear
little satiating or something for that,154.129,3.69,157.819,happy
nature the carbonation you get that,155.93,3.21,159.14000000000001,happy
little bit of sweetness it can kind of,157.819,2.79,160.60899999999998,happy
hold off some of those sugar cravings,159.14,3.9,163.04,fear
that doesn't work for everybody some,160.609,5.22,165.829,fear
people don't like being exposed to,163.04,4.559,167.599,fear
sweetness any kind of sweetness because,165.829,3.211,169.04000000000002,fear
it causes them to have an urge to,167.599,4.381,171.98,fear
overeat on sweetness hey that's great if,169.04,4.619,173.659,fear
you know you're one of those people then,171.98,4.17,176.14999999999998,fear
avoid but if you're people like me and,173.659,5.73,179.38899999999998,fear
Holly who really get a lot out of just,176.15,4.169,180.31900000000002,fear
being able to have something a little,179.389,4.71,184.09900000000002,fear
bit sweet then it's fine and there's no,180.319,5.401,185.72,fear
evidence increases insulin it's not,184.099,2.911,187.01,fear
going to cause you to lay down body fat,185.72,5.04,190.76,fear
and if it did why when it's compared,187.01,5.839,192.849,fear
straight up with water do we not see a,190.76,4.909,195.66899999999998,fear
drastically different loss of body fat,192.849,5.441,198.29,fear
we don't see that in fact we see just a,195.669,4.451,200.12,fear
little bit more loss in the group,198.29,4.229,202.519,fear
drinking artificial sweeteners so I'm,200.12,3.269,203.389,surprise
