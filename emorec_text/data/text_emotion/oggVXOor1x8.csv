hey guys back with a new educational,0.03,5.039,5.069,neutral
video and this week our content is,2.52,4.56,7.08,neutral
coming from dr. Mark Hyman,5.069,4.981,10.05,neutral
one of my favorite people on the,7.08,5.88,12.96,neutral
interwebs actually he's not if you,10.05,3.509,13.559000000000001,happy
couldn't tell,12.96,4.98,17.94,neutral
so Hyman likes to really stir the pot,13.559,6.001,19.56,neutral
and say things that are pretty,17.94,5.7,23.64,neutral
outlandish but that the average person,19.56,7.62,27.18,neutral
buys into it's really kind of disturbing,23.64,6.32,29.96,neutral
but he put up a post the other day that,27.18,5.75,32.93,neutral
really made me laugh and the post was,29.96,5.05,35.01,neutral
artificial sweetners trick your,32.93,4.21,37.14,neutral
metabolism into thinking sugar is on its,35.01,4.619,39.629,neutral
way this causes your body to pump out,37.14,4.5,41.64,fear
insulin the fat storage hormone which,39.629,4.95,44.579,neutral
lays down more belly fat let's unpack,41.64,5.43,47.07,neutral
that a little bit so first of all,44.579,5.311,49.89,neutral
there's actually no research that I'm,47.07,3.509,50.579,neutral
aware of,49.89,2.46,52.35,neutral
showing that artificial sweeteners,50.579,4.351,54.93,neutral
increase insulin there's been several,52.35,4.709,57.059,neutral
studies looking at it none has shown,54.93,6.66,61.59,neutral
this further if insulin was released in,57.059,7.201,64.25999999999999,neutral
significant amounts from consuming,61.59,4.92,66.51,neutral
artificial sweeteners then every time,64.26,4.2,68.46000000000001,neutral
you drank a diet coke you would go,66.51,5.31,71.82000000000001,neutral
hypoglycemic why because insulin,68.46,5.699,74.15899999999999,neutral
responds to increases in blood glucose,71.82,5.939,77.75899999999999,neutral
and insulin acts to drive glucose into,74.159,7.14,81.299,neutral
cells and lower blood glucose so if your,77.759,5.911,83.67,neutral
blood glucose does not elevate which,81.299,5.841,87.14,neutral
would not happen from a diet coke then,83.67,6.629,90.299,neutral
you're gonna go hypoglycemic because if,87.14,4.659,91.799,fear
insulin is released it's gonna drive,90.299,3.36,93.659,neutral
down your blood sugar that doesn't,91.799,5.311,97.11000000000001,neutral
happen so the only other option is if,93.659,6.301,99.96000000000001,neutral
insulin went up that glucagon is also,97.11,4.829,101.939,fear
going up in concert glucagon acts in,99.96,4.32,104.28,neutral
opposition to insulin but the great,101.939,4.11,106.04899999999999,neutral
thing about glucagon is you don't have,104.28,3.06,107.34,neutral
to worry about fat storage because,106.049,4.201,110.25,neutral
glucagon increases lipolysis so anything,107.34,4.65,111.99000000000001,neutral
that would be happy with insulin would,110.25,4.89,115.14,neutral
be offset by glue gun but the research,111.99,5.159,117.149,neutral
seems to show that artificial sweeteners,115.14,4.29,119.43,neutral
don't really increase insulin and if we,117.149,5.82,122.969,neutral
look at the long-term data straight up,119.43,6.21,125.64,neutral
there was a study where they compared,122.969,4.801,127.77,neutral
people who drank artificial sweeteners,125.64,6.29,131.93,neutral
versus water okay so they had one,127.77,5.93,133.7,neutral
just drink water they had another group,131.93,4.38,136.31,neutral
that drank sugar or artificially,133.7,4.89,138.58999999999997,neutral
sweetened beverages they actually found,136.31,3.81,140.12,neutral
that the group that drank artificially,138.59,3.119,141.709,neutral
sweetened beverages lost a little bit,140.12,3.839,143.959,neutral
more body weight and body fat I'm not,141.709,3.961,145.67000000000002,neutral
saying that these things are fat burners,143.959,4.021,147.98,neutral
they are not that group probably,145.67,5.25,150.92,neutral
consumed less calories for me and others,147.98,6.149,154.129,neutral
I know that having a diet coke can be a,150.92,5.01,155.92999999999998,neutral
little satiating or something for that,154.129,3.69,157.819,neutral
nature the carbonation you get that,155.93,3.21,159.14000000000001,neutral
little bit of sweetness it can kind of,157.819,2.79,160.60899999999998,neutral
hold off some of those sugar cravings,159.14,3.9,163.04,neutral
that doesn't work for everybody some,160.609,5.22,165.829,neutral
people don't like being exposed to,163.04,4.559,167.599,neutral
sweetness any kind of sweetness because,165.829,3.211,169.04000000000002,neutral
it causes them to have an urge to,167.599,4.381,171.98,neutral
overeat on sweetness hey that's great if,169.04,4.619,173.659,neutral
you know you're one of those people then,171.98,4.17,176.14999999999998,neutral
avoid but if you're people like me and,173.659,5.73,179.38899999999998,neutral
Holly who really get a lot out of just,176.15,4.169,180.31900000000002,neutral
being able to have something a little,179.389,4.71,184.09900000000002,neutral
bit sweet then it's fine and there's no,180.319,5.401,185.72,neutral
evidence increases insulin it's not,184.099,2.911,187.01,neutral
going to cause you to lay down body fat,185.72,5.04,190.76,neutral
and if it did why when it's compared,187.01,5.839,192.849,neutral
straight up with water do we not see a,190.76,4.909,195.66899999999998,neutral
drastically different loss of body fat,192.849,5.441,198.29,neutral
we don't see that in fact we see just a,195.669,4.451,200.12,neutral
little bit more loss in the group,198.29,4.229,202.519,neutral
drinking artificial sweeteners so I'm,200.12,3.269,203.389,neutral
sorry mark Kleiman,202.519,3.3,205.81900000000002,neutral
that's bro science and it just got,203.389,4.921,208.31,neutral
