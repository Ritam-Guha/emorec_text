hey guys back with a new educational video and this week our content is coming from dr. Mark Hyman one of my favorite people on the interwebs actually he's not if you,0.03,23.969,23.999000000000002,angry
couldn't tell so Hyman likes to really stir the pot and say things that are pretty outlandish but that the average person buys into it's really kind of disturbing,12.96,30.621000000000002,43.581,angry
but he put up a post the other day that really made me laugh and the post was artificial sweetners trick your metabolism into thinking sugar is on its way this causes your body to pump out,27.18,24.129,51.309,angry
insulin the fat storage hormone which lays down more belly fat let's unpack that a little bit so first of all there's actually no research that I'm aware of,39.629,21.66,61.289,angry
showing that artificial sweeteners increase insulin there's been several studies looking at it none has shown this further if insulin was released in significant amounts from consuming,50.579,27.841,78.42,angry
artificial sweeteners then every time you drank a diet coke you would go hypoglycemic why because insulin responds to increases in blood glucose and insulin acts to drive glucose into,64.26,28.288,92.548,angry
cells and lower blood glucose so if your blood glucose does not elevate which would not happen from a diet coke then you're gonna go hypoglycemic because if insulin is released it's gonna drive,77.759,26.4,104.15899999999999,angry
down your blood sugar that doesn't happen so the only other option is if insulin went up that glucagon is also going up in concert glucagon acts in opposition to insulin but the great,91.799,24.871,116.67,angry
thing about glucagon is you don't have to worry about fat storage because glucagon increases lipolysis so anything that would be happy with insulin would be offset by glue gun but the research,104.28,21.959999999999997,126.24,angry
seems to show that artificial sweeteners don't really increase insulin and if we look at the long-term data straight up there was a study where they compared people who drank artificial sweeteners,115.14,27.411,142.551,angry
versus water okay so they had one just drink water they had another group that drank sugar or artificially sweetened beverages they actually found that the group that drank artificially,127.77,22.128999999999998,149.899,angry
sweetened beverages lost a little bit more body weight and body fat I'm not saying that these things are fat burners they are not that group probably consumed less calories for me and others,140.12,23.22,163.34,angry
I know that having a diet coke can be a little satiating or something for that nature the carbonation you get that little bit of sweetness it can kind of hold off some of those sugar cravings,150.92,18.599999999999998,169.51999999999998,angry
that doesn't work for everybody some people don't like being exposed to sweetness any kind of sweetness because it causes them to have an urge to overeat on sweetness hey that's great if,160.609,21.990000000000002,182.59900000000002,angry
you know you're one of those people then avoid but if you're people like me and Holly who really get a lot out of just being able to have something a little bit sweet then it's fine and there's no,171.98,24.18,196.16,angry
evidence increases insulin it's not going to cause you to lay down body fat and if it did why when it's compared straight up with water do we not see a drastically different loss of body fat,184.099,24.14,208.23899999999998,angry
we don't see that in fact we see just a little bit more loss in the group drinking artificial sweeteners so I'm sorry mark Kleiman that's bro science and it just got,195.669,20.169999999999998,215.839,angry
