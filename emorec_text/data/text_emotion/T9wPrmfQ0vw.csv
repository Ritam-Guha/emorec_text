"One of the most common complaints of fatigue
and symptoms of adrenal fatigue is the need to have food in order to avoid fatigue, brain
fog, soon after a meal is taken. This is Dr. Lam, founder of DrLam.com and in this video
we will go over the mechanics of what happens in this for of hypoglycemia which we call
reactive hypoglycemia. Laboratory tests, if you take a spot of the
blood sample at the time of the sensation",6.7,34.169999999999995,40.87,angry
"of fatigue, brain fog, and anxiety are usually
normal. So, sufferers are universally baffled. Doctors are also not sure what is going on
and tell the client or the patient that it's fine; but is it really fine? Let's take a
look. When the blood sugar is dropping then the
term hypoglycemia is used. Usually clinically we see the laboratory value of sugar less
than 60-70 mg per decimeter, but in the case",40.87,36.26,77.13,angry
"of adrenal fatigue associated with hypoglycemic
episodes, the blood sugar actually is normal. Now, we don't exactly know why this is happening,
but we do know that there is a form of reactive type of hypoglycemia, a form of hypoglycemia
that is called reactive hypoglycemia, I should be clearer, in that it is not the absolute
level of blood sugar that decides whether you have symptoms or not; however, it is that
you are of normal blood sugar, let's say 100-120",77.13,32.58,109.71,angry
"mg per decimeter to the 60-70 or even 80,
so while you can have a blood sugar of 80 and be considered normal, the drop from 110-80
is what triggers the hypoglycemic symptoms. This is why it is called reactive hypoglycemia,
and when you have this which is commonly associated with adrenal fatigue, laboratory tests will
show normal. Now what you can do is to eat a bit more frequently,
and that is the common thing to do, but you",109.71,35.660000000000004,145.37,angry
"also want to not just simply eat but understand
the physiology that this is the way your body is telling you that it is metabolically deranged
and in need. You are not necessarily in a diabetic situation and you are not necessarily
having a medical clinical diagnosis of hypoglycemia, but you have hypoglycemic symptoms, and laboratory
results are normal. Now, eating small snacks is a good thing to
do, repeat blood test is not usually productive,",145.37,33.93,179.3,angry
"but reactive hypoglycemia is a sign of later
stages of adrenal fatigue, and usually when that happens to you it is a sign that you
have to look and see what else is going on. Usually, it also accompanied by brain fog,
irritability, and at night time it can actually wake you up after you've been sleeping. During
the day time, after lunch, you may have to find that you need a snack about two hours
before, or afterwards I'm sorry, otherwise",179.3,31.730000000000004,211.03000000000003,angry
"you will feel really draggy, and fatigued
and slumpy. The same thing may happen in the morning around 10 am around 2 or 3 hours after
breakfast, before lunch, you will then feel a sense that you really need food and if you
don't have that food supply or the sugar boost then your body will feel very, very weak.
These are classic signs of reactive hypoglycemia in the situation of adrenal fatigue.",211.03,29.060000000000002,240.09,angry
"Now, it is very important also to check with
your doctor to see that there are other forms of metabolic imbalances. Those people who
have a family history of diabetes especially should be a little bit more careful because
your body can react in different ways under those situations. But, if you really put the
picture together clinically, in adrenal fatigue you can really sense the big picture, and
that big picture is what counts it is not",240.09,24.63,264.72,NA
"just the hypoglycemic episode on its own.
Sometimes it can be accompanied as I said earlier with brain fog, heart palpitations,
pain of unknown origin, insomnia, heart palpitations and arrhythmia, joint pains, etc., etc. So
knowing this is one of the leads that bring us to adrenal fatigue and how to overcome
this is something that we can deal with once we understand the physiology.",264.72,35.459999999999994,300.18,NA
