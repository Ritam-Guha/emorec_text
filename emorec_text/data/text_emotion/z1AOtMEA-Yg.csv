hey guys dr. Burke here in this video,0.03,3.119,3.149,fear
we're gonna talk about the two most,1.319,5.101,6.42,fear
ignored minerals and diabetes okay so,3.149,6.541,9.690000000000001,fear
this is really cool information this is,6.42,5.07,11.49,fear
very powerful if you are a diabetic or,9.69,3.569,13.259,fear
if you're a pre-diabetic and you have,11.49,3.269,14.759,fear
infinite resistance and what I mean by,13.259,3.481,16.740000000000002,fear
that is if you have belly fat if you,14.759,4.801,19.560000000000002,fear
have a fatty liver if you're tired after,16.74,3.51,20.25,neutral
eating,19.56,2.7,22.259999999999998,neutral
if you can't go between meals without,20.25,4.65,24.9,neutral
being very hungry if you feel better,22.26,5.88,28.14,fear
when you eat if you have swell a swollen,24.9,4.77,29.669999999999998,fear
belly if you actually have sweet,28.14,2.729,30.869,fear
cravings or high blood pressure those,29.67,3.9,33.57,fear
are all signs of insulin resistance if,30.869,4.861,35.73,fear
you have that you this videos for you,33.57,4.02,37.59,neutral
there are two minerals one is potassium,35.73,3.27,39.0,neutral
and one is magnesium,37.59,4.469,42.059000000000005,fear
now magnesium makes an enzymes to help,39.0,5.73,44.730000000000004,fear
lower the blood sugar faciem is involved,42.059,5.971,48.03,fear
with helping the storage of sugar called,44.73,5.91,50.64,fear
glycogen so your body will store sugar,48.03,5.07,53.1,fear
in between meals and your liver and your,50.64,3.87,54.51,neutral
muscles so if you don't have that,53.1,4.08,57.18,fear
capacity it could be because you don't,54.51,4.77,59.28,fear
have no potassium but here's the thing,57.18,4.49,61.67,fear
that's that people don't realize insulin,59.28,5.94,65.22,fear
triggers the absorption uptake of both,61.67,5.79,67.46000000000001,fear
potassium and magnesium in the cell,65.22,5.61,70.83,fear
without insulin you cannot absorb,67.46,8.65,76.11,fear
magnesium or potassium okay so right,70.83,6.21,77.03999999999999,fear
there that's going to create a,76.11,3.0,79.11,neutral
deficiency and then both of these,77.04,4.469,81.509,fear
actions to lower the blood sugars and,79.11,3.63,82.74,fear
the storage of glycogen aren't gonna,81.509,3.631,85.14,fear
happen so you have a double-edged sword,82.74,6.08,88.82,fear
so what happens is when you increase,85.14,6.81,91.95,neutral
magnesium and potassium or just normal,88.82,6.49,95.30999999999999,fear
if you just have the normal amount you,91.95,5.01,96.96000000000001,fear
can decrease the need for instance you,95.31,4.769,100.07900000000001,fear
can actually help heal the sensitivity,96.96,5.519,102.479,fear
to glucose and the insulin resistance,100.079,4.011,104.08999999999999,fear
and I'm gonna put some links down below,102.479,3.721,106.2,fear
that there's studies that show that you,104.09,4.87,108.96000000000001,fear
can take these two minerals and greatly,106.2,5.79,111.99000000000001,fear
improve if not fix insulin resistance of,108.96,4.949,113.90899999999999,fear
course you have to change your diet and,111.99,3.449,115.439,fear
things like that but that's very very,113.909,4.35,118.259,fear
amazing that these two minerals can,115.439,4.5,119.939,fear
actually lower the need for insulin and,118.259,3.531,121.79,fear
then when you lower the need for insulin,119.939,4.47,124.40899999999999,fear
now you have enough insulin to pull in,121.79,5.74,127.53,fear
these minerals into the cell and it just,124.409,5.82,130.229,fear
will all work out real nicely okay now,127.53,3.959,131.489,neutral
the other thing is that hypercalcemia,130.229,3.62,133.84900000000002,neutral
that's too much calcium,131.489,4.131,135.62,sad
if you look that up and I put a link,133.849,3.961,137.81,fear
down below that can cause diabetes,135.62,4.619,140.239,fear
that's one of the interesting side,137.81,4.17,141.98,fear
effects from having hypercalcemia cause,140.239,2.461,142.70000000000002,surprise
of diabetes,141.98,2.22,144.2,NA
probably because when you have too much,142.7,5.25,147.95,fear
calcium calcium it can lock up magnesium,144.2,5.64,149.83999999999997,fear
because calcium magnesium work together,147.95,4.53,152.48,fear
so if you have soft tissue calcium and,149.84,4.58,154.42000000000002,fear
spurring arthritis and things like that,152.48,7.5,159.98,fear
or taking tums or calcium carbonate you,154.42,7.299,161.719,fear
know you're not taking up magnesium just,159.98,4.47,164.45,fear
straight calcium carbonate you know,161.719,4.261,165.98,neutral
especially if you're an anti acids that,164.45,4.819,169.26899999999998,neutral
can set you up for diabetes interesting,165.98,6.33,172.31,fear
that's probably also why vitamin d3 in,169.269,5.741,175.01,fear
k2 improve diabetes as well I put some,172.31,3.929,176.239,sad
links down below for that too so,175.01,2.97,177.98,neutral
probably because this mobilizes the,176.239,5.33,181.56900000000002,neutral
calcium and frees up the magnesium so,177.98,8.28,186.26,neutral
how can you get these minerals well this,181.569,6.191,187.76,surprise
will happens they're both in the same,186.26,5.099,191.35899999999998,surprise
food vegetables yeah so we keep coming,187.76,5.369,193.129,NA
back to this vegetable thing right you,191.359,4.261,195.62,fear
need 7 to 10 cups of vegetables every,193.129,4.95,198.07899999999998,fear
single day you can do in the blender you,195.62,5.339,200.959,fear
can do it in a salad it's not that hard,198.079,6.78,204.859,neutral
but it's very important to get that,200.959,6.601,207.56,neutral
amount because if you're doing 7 to 10,204.859,4.231,209.09,NA
cups to your potassium you're gonna,207.56,3.539,211.099,NA
easily get the magnesium because,209.09,4.019,213.109,NA
magnesium is in the fan vegetables you,211.099,3.66,214.759,NA
don't need as much you need about take,213.109,4.53,217.639,NA
450 milligrams but you need 4700,214.759,5.19,219.94899999999998,NA
milligrams of potassium so here's what I,217.639,5.97,223.609,NA
want you to do for the next week go,219.949,5.4,225.34900000000002,NA
ahead and start consuming more,223.609,4.41,228.019,NA
vegetables you'll increase these and,225.349,4.801,230.14999999999998,NA
just see if any of these symptoms start,228.019,5.19,233.209,NA
going away then you'll know that this is,230.15,5.519,235.669,NA
what caused or contributed to your,233.209,4.381,237.59,NA
problem in the first place alright,235.669,4.47,240.139,NA
thanks for watching oh and I'll check,237.59,5.299,242.889,NA
out your comments below,240.139,2.75,242.889,NA
