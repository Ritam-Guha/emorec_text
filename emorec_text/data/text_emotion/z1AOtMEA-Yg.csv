hey guys dr. Burke here in this video we're gonna talk about the two most ignored minerals and diabetes okay so this is really cool information this is very powerful if you are a diabetic or,0.03,23.400000000000002,23.430000000000003,angry
if you're a pre-diabetic and you have infinite resistance and what I mean by that is if you have belly fat if you have a fatty liver if you're tired after eating,11.49,17.761,29.250999999999998,angry
if you can't go between meals without being very hungry if you feel better when you eat if you have swell a swollen belly if you actually have sweet cravings or high blood pressure those,20.25,21.929,42.179,angry
are all signs of insulin resistance if you have that you this videos for you there are two minerals one is potassium and one is magnesium now magnesium makes an enzymes to help,30.869,22.35,53.219,angry
lower the blood sugar faciem is involved with helping the storage of sugar called glycogen so your body will store sugar in between meals and your liver and your muscles so if you don't have that,42.059,24.901000000000003,66.96000000000001,angry
capacity it could be because you don't have no potassium but here's the thing that's that people don't realize insulin triggers the absorption uptake of both potassium and magnesium in the cell,54.51,26.599999999999998,81.11,angry
without insulin you cannot absorb magnesium or potassium okay so right there that's going to create a deficiency and then both of these actions to lower the blood sugars and,67.46,25.959,93.419,angry
the storage of glycogen aren't gonna happen so you have a double-edged sword so what happens is when you increase magnesium and potassium or just normal if you just have the normal amount you,81.509,28.021,109.53,angry
can decrease the need for instance you can actually help heal the sensitivity to glucose and the insulin resistance and I'm gonna put some links down below that there's studies that show that you,95.31,22.89,118.2,angry
can take these two minerals and greatly improve if not fix insulin resistance of course you have to change your diet and things like that but that's very very amazing that these two minerals can,106.2,23.038,129.238,angry
actually lower the need for insulin and then when you lower the need for insulin now you have enough insulin to pull in these minerals into the cell and it just will all work out real nicely okay now,118.259,23.52,141.779,angry
the other thing is that hypercalcemia that's too much calcium if you look that up and I put a link down below that can cause diabetes that's one of the interesting side,130.229,20.500999999999998,150.73000000000002,angry
effects from having hypercalcemia cause of diabetes probably because when you have too much calcium calcium it can lock up magnesium because calcium magnesium work together,140.239,20.101000000000003,160.34,angry
so if you have soft tissue calcium and spurring arthritis and things like that or taking tums or calcium carbonate you know you're not taking up magnesium just straight calcium carbonate you know,149.84,28.11,177.95,angry
especially if you're an anti acids that can set you up for diabetes interesting that's probably also why vitamin d3 in k2 improve diabetes as well I put some links down below for that too so,164.45,23.788999999999998,188.23899999999998,angry
probably because this mobilizes the calcium and frees up the magnesium so how can you get these minerals well this will happens they're both in the same food vegetables yeah so we keep coming,176.239,30.269,206.508,angry
back to this vegetable thing right you need 7 to 10 cups of vegetables every single day you can do in the blender you can do it in a salad it's not that hard but it's very important to get that,191.359,27.931,219.29000000000002,angry
amount because if you're doing 7 to 10 cups to your potassium you're gonna easily get the magnesium because magnesium is in the fan vegetables you don't need as much you need about take,204.859,19.979,224.83800000000002,NA
450 milligrams but you need 4700 milligrams of potassium so here's what I want you to do for the next week go ahead and start consuming more vegetables you'll increase these and,214.759,25.771,240.52999999999997,NA
just see if any of these symptoms start going away then you'll know that this is what caused or contributed to your problem in the first place alright thanks for watching oh and I'll check,228.019,24.858999999999998,252.87800000000001,NA
