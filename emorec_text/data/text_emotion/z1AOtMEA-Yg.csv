hey guys dr. Burke here in this video,0.03,3.119,3.149,
we're gonna talk about the two most,1.319,5.101,6.42,
ignored minerals and diabetes okay so,3.149,6.541,9.690000000000001,
this is really cool information this is,6.42,5.07,11.49,disgust
very powerful if you are a diabetic or,9.69,3.569,13.259,
if you're a pre-diabetic and you have,11.49,3.269,14.759,
infinite resistance and what I mean by,13.259,3.481,16.740000000000002,fear
that is if you have belly fat if you,14.759,4.801,19.560000000000002,fear
have a fatty liver if you're tired after,16.74,3.51,20.25,angry
eating,19.56,2.7,22.259999999999998,
if you can't go between meals without,20.25,4.65,24.9,
being very hungry if you feel better,22.26,5.88,28.14,
when you eat if you have swell a swollen,24.9,4.77,29.669999999999998,
belly if you actually have sweet,28.14,2.729,30.869,
cravings or high blood pressure those,29.67,3.9,33.57,
are all signs of insulin resistance if,30.869,4.861,35.73,
you have that you this videos for you,33.57,4.02,37.59,
there are two minerals one is potassium,35.73,3.27,39.0,
and one is magnesium,37.59,4.469,42.059000000000005,fear
now magnesium makes an enzymes to help,39.0,5.73,44.730000000000004,fear
lower the blood sugar faciem is involved,42.059,5.971,48.03,
with helping the storage of sugar called,44.73,5.91,50.64,
glycogen so your body will store sugar,48.03,5.07,53.1,
in between meals and your liver and your,50.64,3.87,54.51,
muscles so if you don't have that,53.1,4.08,57.18,
capacity it could be because you don't,54.51,4.77,59.28,
have no potassium but here's the thing,57.18,4.49,61.67,fear
that's that people don't realize insulin,59.28,5.94,65.22,
triggers the absorption uptake of both,61.67,5.79,67.46000000000001,
potassium and magnesium in the cell,65.22,5.61,70.83,
without insulin you cannot absorb,67.46,8.65,76.11,
magnesium or potassium okay so right,70.83,6.21,77.03999999999999,
there that's going to create a,76.11,3.0,79.11,
deficiency and then both of these,77.04,4.469,81.509,
actions to lower the blood sugars and,79.11,3.63,82.74,
the storage of glycogen aren't gonna,81.509,3.631,85.14,fear
happen so you have a double-edged sword,82.74,6.08,88.82,
so what happens is when you increase,85.14,6.81,91.95,
magnesium and potassium or just normal,88.82,6.49,95.30999999999999,
if you just have the normal amount you,91.95,5.01,96.96000000000001,
can decrease the need for instance you,95.31,4.769,100.07900000000001,
can actually help heal the sensitivity,96.96,5.519,102.479,
to glucose and the insulin resistance,100.079,4.011,104.08999999999999,fear
and I'm gonna put some links down below,102.479,3.721,106.2,fear
that there's studies that show that you,104.09,4.87,108.96000000000001,
can take these two minerals and greatly,106.2,5.79,111.99000000000001,
improve if not fix insulin resistance of,108.96,4.949,113.90899999999999,
course you have to change your diet and,111.99,3.449,115.439,fear
things like that but that's very very,113.909,4.35,118.259,fear
amazing that these two minerals can,115.439,4.5,119.939,
actually lower the need for insulin and,118.259,3.531,121.79,
then when you lower the need for insulin,119.939,4.47,124.40899999999999,
now you have enough insulin to pull in,121.79,5.74,127.53,
these minerals into the cell and it just,124.409,5.82,130.229,
will all work out real nicely okay now,127.53,3.959,131.489,
the other thing is that hypercalcemia,130.229,3.62,133.84900000000002,
that's too much calcium,131.489,4.131,135.62,
if you look that up and I put a link,133.849,3.961,137.81,
down below that can cause diabetes,135.62,4.619,140.239,
that's one of the interesting side,137.81,4.17,141.98,
effects from having hypercalcemia cause,140.239,2.461,142.70000000000002,
of diabetes,141.98,2.22,144.2,
probably because when you have too much,142.7,5.25,147.95,
calcium calcium it can lock up magnesium,144.2,5.64,149.83999999999997,
because calcium magnesium work together,147.95,4.53,152.48,
so if you have soft tissue calcium and,149.84,4.58,154.42000000000002,
spurring arthritis and things like that,152.48,7.5,159.98,
or taking tums or calcium carbonate you,154.42,7.299,161.719,
know you're not taking up magnesium just,159.98,4.47,164.45,
straight calcium carbonate you know,161.719,4.261,165.98,
especially if you're an anti acids that,164.45,4.819,169.26899999999998,
can set you up for diabetes interesting,165.98,6.33,172.31,
that's probably also why vitamin d3 in,169.269,5.741,175.01,
k2 improve diabetes as well I put some,172.31,3.929,176.239,
links down below for that too so,175.01,2.97,177.98,angry
probably because this mobilizes the,176.239,5.33,181.56900000000002,
calcium and frees up the magnesium so,177.98,8.28,186.26,
how can you get these minerals well this,181.569,6.191,187.76,
will happens they're both in the same,186.26,5.099,191.35899999999998,
food vegetables yeah so we keep coming,187.76,5.369,193.129,
back to this vegetable thing right you,191.359,4.261,195.62,
need 7 to 10 cups of vegetables every,193.129,4.95,198.07899999999998,
single day you can do in the blender you,195.62,5.339,200.959,
can do it in a salad it's not that hard,198.079,6.78,204.859,
but it's very important to get that,200.959,6.601,207.56,happy
amount because if you're doing 7 to 10,204.859,4.231,209.09,NA
cups to your potassium you're gonna,207.56,3.539,211.099,NA
easily get the magnesium because,209.09,4.019,213.109,NA
magnesium is in the fan vegetables you,211.099,3.66,214.759,NA
don't need as much you need about take,213.109,4.53,217.639,NA
450 milligrams but you need 4700,214.759,5.19,219.94899999999998,NA
milligrams of potassium so here's what I,217.639,5.97,223.609,NA
want you to do for the next week go,219.949,5.4,225.34900000000002,NA
ahead and start consuming more,223.609,4.41,228.019,NA
vegetables you'll increase these and,225.349,4.801,230.14999999999998,NA
just see if any of these symptoms start,228.019,5.19,233.209,NA
going away then you'll know that this is,230.15,5.519,235.669,NA
what caused or contributed to your,233.209,4.381,237.59,NA
problem in the first place alright,235.669,4.47,240.139,NA
thanks for watching oh and I'll check,237.59,5.299,242.889,NA
out your comments below,240.139,2.75,242.889,NA
