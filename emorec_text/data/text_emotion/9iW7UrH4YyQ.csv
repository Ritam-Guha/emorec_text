yeah so almost all cases with acromegaly,2.32,4.479,6.7989999999999995,
are due to a pituitary tumor,4.88,4.24,9.120000000000001,fear
it's usually a macroadenoma meaning a,6.799,4.081,10.88,fear
tumor that's greater than one centimeter,9.12,4.0,13.12,fear
as opposed to a microadenoma which is a,10.88,4.4,15.280000000000001,fear
pituitary tumor less than one centimeter,13.12,4.079,17.198999999999998,fear
both cases are possible even rare cases,15.28,3.52,18.8,neutral
of no tumor seen because it's so small,17.199,3.201,20.400000000000002,fear
you can't find it on the mri,18.8,3.2,22.0,fear
the vast majority of patients with,20.4,4.16,24.56,fear
acromegaly have a macroadenoma and that,22.0,4.48,26.48,fear
will be seen on the mri,24.56,4.4,28.96,neutral
and that is a pituitary tumor that looks,26.48,5.36,31.84,neutral
like a lesion there or a mass lesion,28.96,5.92,34.88,neutral
that is over producing an over secreting,31.84,5.44,37.28,neutral
growth hormone causing this disease,34.88,4.32,39.2,neutral
almost all patients will have a growth,37.28,4.24,41.52,neutral
hormone secreting pituitary adenoma,39.2,5.039,44.239000000000004,neutral
as the cause for their acromegaly there,41.52,5.359,46.879000000000005,neutral
are very rare situations,44.239,4.8,49.038999999999994,neutral
where there are alternate causes of,46.879,3.441,50.32,neutral
acromegaly,49.039,2.961,52.0,neutral
and those are patients that have what we,50.32,4.719,55.039,neutral
call ectopic secretion of growth hormone,52.0,6.239,58.239,neutral
that can be from a tumor somewhere else,55.039,3.921,58.96,neutral
that makes,58.239,3.921,62.16,neutral
growth hormone or a tumor somewhere else,58.96,5.839,64.799,neutral
that makes growth hormone releasing,62.16,3.279,65.439,neutral
hormone,64.799,2.881,67.68,neutral
ghrh which is the stimulator for growth,65.439,3.121,68.55999999999999,neutral
hormone,67.68,4.72,72.4,neutral
they're both very uncommon although ghrh,68.56,5.68,74.24000000000001,neutral
secretion as an ectopic source of,72.4,2.88,75.28,neutral
acromegaly,74.24,4.48,78.72,neutral
is more likely than ectopic gh,75.28,6.159,81.43900000000001,neutral
secretion but in either case you you,78.72,3.439,82.15899999999999,neutral
would have no,81.439,3.521,84.96,neutral
pituitary tumor but you would have an,82.159,4.721,86.88000000000001,neutral
excess of growth hormone or,84.96,4.56,89.52,neutral
