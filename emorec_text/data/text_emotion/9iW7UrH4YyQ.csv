yeah so almost all cases with acromegaly,2.32,4.479,6.7989999999999995,sad
are due to a pituitary tumor,4.88,4.24,9.120000000000001,sad
it's usually a macroadenoma meaning a,6.799,4.081,10.88,sad
tumor that's greater than one centimeter,9.12,4.0,13.12,sad
as opposed to a microadenoma which is a,10.88,4.4,15.280000000000001,fear
pituitary tumor less than one centimeter,13.12,4.079,17.198999999999998,sad
both cases are possible even rare cases,15.28,3.52,18.8,sad
of no tumor seen because it's so small,17.199,3.201,20.400000000000002,sad
you can't find it on the mri,18.8,3.2,22.0,fear
the vast majority of patients with,20.4,4.16,24.56,sad
acromegaly have a macroadenoma and that,22.0,4.48,26.48,sad
will be seen on the mri,24.56,4.4,28.96,sad
and that is a pituitary tumor that looks,26.48,5.36,31.84,neutral
like a lesion there or a mass lesion,28.96,5.92,34.88,neutral
that is over producing an over secreting,31.84,5.44,37.28,neutral
growth hormone causing this disease,34.88,4.32,39.2,sad
almost all patients will have a growth,37.28,4.24,41.52,sad
hormone secreting pituitary adenoma,39.2,5.039,44.239000000000004,sad
as the cause for their acromegaly there,41.52,5.359,46.879000000000005,sad
are very rare situations,44.239,4.8,49.038999999999994,sad
where there are alternate causes of,46.879,3.441,50.32,sad
acromegaly,49.039,2.961,52.0,neutral
and those are patients that have what we,50.32,4.719,55.039,sad
call ectopic secretion of growth hormone,52.0,6.239,58.239,sad
that can be from a tumor somewhere else,55.039,3.921,58.96,neutral
that makes,58.239,3.921,62.16,sad
growth hormone or a tumor somewhere else,58.96,5.839,64.799,sad
that makes growth hormone releasing,62.16,3.279,65.439,sad
hormone,64.799,2.881,67.68,sad
ghrh which is the stimulator for growth,65.439,3.121,68.55999999999999,sad
hormone,67.68,4.72,72.4,sad
they're both very uncommon although ghrh,68.56,5.68,74.24000000000001,sad
secretion as an ectopic source of,72.4,2.88,75.28,neutral
acromegaly,74.24,4.48,78.72,sad
is more likely than ectopic gh,75.28,6.159,81.43900000000001,sad
secretion but in either case you you,78.72,3.439,82.15899999999999,sad
would have no,81.439,3.521,84.96,neutral
pituitary tumor but you would have an,82.159,4.721,86.88000000000001,sad
excess of growth hormone or,84.96,4.56,89.52,sad
its stimulator ghrh coming from another,86.88,9.12,96.0,neutral
tumor source,89.52,6.48,96.0,neutral
