in a contemporary society where an,3.84,5.12,8.96,
individual's ideal self is heavily,6.399,5.12,11.519,
influenced by pop culture and media,8.96,4.88,13.84,
it is easy to understand why some women,11.519,6.961,18.48,
define beauty as being slim and hairless,13.84,4.64,18.48,
society's definition of beauty is,22.08,5.119,27.198999999999998,angry
extremely problematic because this ideal,24.4,4.959,29.358999999999998,angry
prototype can only be achieved in a,27.199,4.721,31.92,angry
specific cohort of women who have the,29.359,5.841,35.2,
biological framework,31.92,3.28,35.2,
i was diagnosed with picoset 12. in the,37.76,4.479,42.239,
years to follow i suffered from,40.64,4.079,44.719,
irregular periods weight gain and a lot,42.239,5.121,47.36,
of body hair,44.719,2.641,47.36,
i have always tried to remain a,48.879,4.16,53.039,
relatively healthy lifestyle however i,50.32,4.48,54.8,
constantly struggle with my weight and,53.039,3.121,56.160000000000004,
have suffered from anxiety and,54.8,5.04,59.839999999999996,
depression in university,56.16,3.68,59.839999999999996,
there are many biases women with picos,60.8,3.999,64.79899999999999,
face and without a proper understanding,62.8,4.48,67.28,
of picos and its implications there is a,64.799,4.721,69.52000000000001,
societal gap in sensitivity that cannot,67.28,5.879,73.159,
be easily bridged,69.52,3.639,73.15899999999999,
so,73.76,5.44,79.2,
what is polycystic ovarian syndrome,75.36,5.84,81.2,
picose is caused by an hormonal,79.2,4.4,83.60000000000001,
imbalance within the female body which,81.2,4.559,85.759,
can lead to a variety of both internal,83.6,4.05,87.64999999999999,
and external symptoms,85.759,3.521,89.28,neutral
[Music],87.65,3.789,91.43900000000001,angry
while the disorder is not completely,89.28,4.64,93.92,angry
understood there is a general agreement,91.439,4.801,96.24,fear
among physicians that two of the,93.92,4.96,98.88,fear
following three symptoms must be present,96.24,4.879,101.119,
in order to diagnose picos,98.88,5.44,104.32,
the first one is menstrual irregularity,101.119,5.601,106.72,
which involves an irregular or absent,104.32,4.72,109.03999999999999,
period which can lead to difficulty,106.72,3.679,110.399,
getting pregnant,109.04,2.48,111.52000000000001,
secondly,110.399,3.36,113.759,
increased levels of testosterone which,111.52,4.879,116.399,
is associated with the excess body hair,113.759,5.36,119.119,
facial hair and acne present among women,116.399,6.561,122.96000000000001,
with pecos thirdly polycystic ovaries,119.119,6.481,125.6,
the abnormal presence of cysts in the,122.96,4.88,127.83999999999999,fear
ovaries which can increase risk for,125.6,4.719,130.319,
uterine cancer these symptoms can be,127.84,5.2,133.04,
accompanied by diabetes obesity and,130.319,4.0,134.319,
heart disease,133.04,4.0,137.04,
currently there is no cure for pecos but,134.319,4.801,139.11999999999998,
you can manage the pico symptoms through,137.04,4.08,141.12,
different therapeutic methods,139.12,4.4,143.52,
normally symptoms of pecos will resolve,141.12,4.4,145.52,
themselves once a woman is nearing,143.52,4.079,147.59900000000002,
menopause studies have suggested that,145.52,4.64,150.16,
picos may have a large genetic component,147.599,5.121,152.72,
as reports demonstrate that picos is,150.16,4.64,154.79999999999998,
more prevalent within family clusters,152.72,4.64,157.35999999999999,
rather than the general population,154.8,5.439,160.239,
furthermore in a study by allegro et al,157.36,5.44,162.8,
which investigated picos outcomes in 80,160.239,4.801,165.04,
mothers found that 22 percent of,162.8,5.439,168.239,
daughters tested positive for picos,165.04,5.36,170.4,
increased androgen levels a hallmark,168.239,4.64,172.879,
symptom for picos was not exclusive to,170.4,4.8,175.20000000000002,
daughters but was also seen in sons of,172.879,4.401,177.28,
these 80 mothers,175.2,4.0,179.2,
while this suggests a strong genetic,177.28,4.879,182.159,
predisposition for picos a clear linkage,179.2,5.119,184.319,
of specific genes associated with this,182.159,4.481,186.64,
condition is unclear,184.319,4.161,188.48,
genes that are relevant for picos are,186.64,3.76,190.39999999999998,
also associated with other genetic,188.48,4.0,192.48,
disorders and thus determining the,190.4,4.08,194.48000000000002,neutral

beautiful and for those with picos you,204.48,4.399,208.879,
should not view this as a liability but,206.64,3.84,210.48,
as an asset which defines your,208.879,3.841,212.72,angry
