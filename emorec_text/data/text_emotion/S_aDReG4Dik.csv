"Hello and welcome to this video about 
your HbA1c blood test or your diabetes   blood test and what it means. This is 
part of a whole series of videos if   you want to check out other organ 
systems just look at the playlist.   As always if your HbA1c blood test you've got 
back is really really high go see your doctor   but if you just want to learn a little bit more 
about what that blood test means stay watching  ",0.0,21.200000000000003,21.200000000000003,neutral
"So what is the HbA1c blood test? Well it's a 
measure of the sugar in your blood, which is   a marker for diabetes. And so it becomes a really 
important thing that you can track and trend and   monitor over time especially as you start making 
lifestyle adjustments to help reverse diabetes if   that's come along or to stop you getting in the 
first place if you see your levels creeping up. Sugar in the blood can be measured in a lot of 
ways and you might see people measuring it with  ",24.64,25.84,50.480000000000004,neutral
"just a finger brick and looking at what those 
levels are as a snapshot. That's often done by   people who are diabetic and on insulin who need 
to monitor themselves very closely it's of limited   use for the average person that doesn't have that 
kind of condition. Now when your blood cells are   produced they start to bond sugar and they bond 
it irreversibly for their whole lifespan which is   about three or four months. So if you have a lot of 
sugar floating in your blood the new blood cells  ",50.48,24.639999999999997,75.11999999999999,neutral
"bond it for three or four months and when we look 
at your HbA1c we look at your red blood cells and   we can see that they've bonded a lot of sugar 
which means that you've got too much sugar in   your blood. If you have the normal amount then the 
cells just bond the normal amount and everything   looks quite nice. HbA1c is a fantastic marker for 
diabetes because it's really easy to measure over   time and you can track and trend it - every three 
to six months you can really see the changes  ",75.12,26.32,101.44,neutral
"of medication or lifestyle interventions which 
you're making. What's more we have our values so   I'll give you the English values now where we can 
actually start diagnosing and defining diabetes.   So if your levels are less than 42 - fantastic you 
probably don't have diabetes! If your levels are   42 to 47 that's something we call ""pre-diabetic"" and 
that means you are on the path to diabetes and   it's time to do something about it. If your levels 
are over 48 that is in diabetic territory. So if  ",101.44,30.4,131.84,neutral
"you're not on medication we look at that kind of 
thing and think well maybe we can reverse that   through things like lifestyle - so increasing 
your exercise levels so everything from running,   cycling or even just mowing the lawn regularly 
and going for brisk walks every day - that can   help reduce your level. Also changing things like 
diet cutting out the simple sugars, cutting out   alcohol, cakes, biscuits, crisps, all that
crappy junk food. If you can move to a more whole  ",131.84,28.799999999999997,160.64,neutral
"food diet that will improve your sugar levels as 
well. Once your levels start going really high your   doctor might start working with you and say that 
you know if lifestyle isn't working they might   start introducing some medication to that as well. 
The idea being to bring down your sugar levels.   So if you're looking at your HbA1c on an annual 
basis and it looks great - fantastic! The moment   it starts to start climbing up that's the time to 
think to yourself 'maybe I need to do more exercise,  ",160.64,27.52,188.16,neutral
"maybe I need to change my diet a bit.' And you can 
bring those levels down. HbA1c is a fantastic way   to track your sugar levels over time. If you 
have diabetes it's fantastic for monitoring   that condition. If you don't have diabetes it's 
a great way to make sure that you're not on a   path to getting it and if you are you can reverse 
that through some simple lifestyle modifications.   That's HbA1c I hope that makes sense and join us 
next time when we're going to be talking about  ",188.16,27.520000000000003,215.68,neutral
