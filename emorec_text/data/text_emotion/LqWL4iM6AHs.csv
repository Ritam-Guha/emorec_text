this content is brought to us by a study,20.48,4.08,24.560000000000002,fear
i will have linked for you as well as my,22.8,4.399,27.199,
notes and any content amendments,24.56,4.719,29.279,
briefly a bit on the study design before,27.199,4.08,31.279000000000003,
we get to the results,29.279,4.001,33.28,happy
this study was prospective meaning the,31.279,3.761,35.04,happy
researchers did not implement any,33.28,3.76,37.04,fear
intervention and simply followed,35.04,3.679,38.719,fear
people already committing to a water,37.04,3.92,40.96,
fast under the supervision of personnel,38.719,4.401,43.120000000000005,
at a fasting institution,40.96,4.72,45.68,
participants of the study chose to fast,43.12,3.84,46.959999999999994,
for either 5,45.68,4.64,50.32,
10 15 or 20 days in a row,46.96,5.599,52.559,
and had to be in generally good health,50.32,3.84,54.16,
although participants tended to be,52.559,2.48,55.038999999999994,
overweight,54.16,3.44,57.599999999999994,
and had some blood pressure issues,55.039,3.04,58.079,
although,57.6,2.4,60.0,
a straight water fast would have been,58.079,4.401,62.480000000000004,
preferable all participants consumed a,60.0,4.64,64.64,
200 calorie soup each day,62.48,4.4,66.88,fear
but the rest of the time they consumed,64.64,3.36,68.0,fear
water,66.88,2.64,69.52,fear
measurements were taken before the,68.0,3.439,71.439,fear
beginning of the study therefore before,69.52,2.72,72.24,fear
the fast,71.439,2.241,73.67999999999999,angry
and then again at the end of their,72.24,3.04,75.28,fear
respective fasts,73.68,3.68,77.36000000000001,fear
unfortunately there were significant,75.28,3.68,78.96000000000001,fear
weight differences between,77.36,4.799,82.159,fear
the 5 10 15 and 20 day conditions,78.96,5.36,84.32,fear
pre-study which makes the comparisons,82.159,4.481,86.64,fear
between the groups difficult but we will,84.32,3.68,88.0,fear
still be able to compare their,86.64,3.119,89.759,happy
pre-fasting measures to their,88.0,3.2,91.2,fear
post-fasting measures,89.759,4.561,94.32,fear
and now let's look at the study data,91.2,5.76,96.96000000000001,
blood glucose sugar was separated out,94.32,3.119,97.439,
between,96.96,3.36,100.32,
men and women with women being open,97.439,4.0,101.439,
circles and men,100.32,4.0,104.32,
being dark triangles in both sexes there,101.439,4.96,106.39899999999999,
was a significant decline in blood,104.32,3.68,108.0,
glucose after only,106.399,4.0,110.399,
five days of fasting which did not,108.0,4.399,112.399,
decrease further with longer fasting,110.399,2.801,113.2,
periods,112.399,2.881,115.28,
implying the effect is rapid and does,113.2,4.72,117.92,neutral
not follow a dose response relationship,115.28,4.799,120.07900000000001,fear
meaning more fasting does not bring,117.92,3.92,121.84,fear
about better results,120.079,5.441,125.52,
shifting to hba1c a marker of glycation,121.84,6.639,128.479,
otherwise stated a marker of sugar being,125.52,4.48,130.0,
attached to hemoglobin,128.479,4.161,132.64000000000001,
a key protein in red blood cells which,130.0,4.0,134.0,
is an indication of a,132.64,4.319,136.95899999999997,
long-term blood glucose pathology as,134.0,4.319,138.319,
elevated a1c,136.959,2.801,139.76,
indicates the blood cells are,138.319,3.92,142.23899999999998,
continuously traveling in a high blood,139.76,3.199,142.959,
glucose,142.239,2.72,144.959,
and spontaneously being tagged with,142.959,4.561,147.52,
sugars in a pathological manner making,144.959,4.241,149.2,
them less functional,147.52,4.64,152.16,
the data here showed the exact same,149.2,3.44,152.64,
trend,152.16,3.12,155.28,
as with regular blood sugar measure an,152.64,3.52,156.16,
immediate,155.28,3.76,159.04,
decrease a good sign with five days of,156.16,5.04,161.2,
fasting and no added improvement,159.04,5.199,164.239,
with 20 days of fasting so this data,161.2,3.92,165.11999999999998,
tells us that,164.239,2.881,167.12,
water fasting is a potent reducer of,165.12,4.24,169.36,
blood sugar in men and women alike,167.12,4.16,171.28,
and this effect is quick happening,169.36,3.68,173.04000000000002,
within the first five days,171.28,4.72,176.0,
and not compounding over time meaning,173.04,5.199,178.239,
the effect after five days is the same,176.0,3.28,179.28,
effect size,178.239,4.481,182.72,fear
seen after 15 or 20 days of fasting,179.28,5.36,184.64000000000001,fear
with that said that is what i have for,182.72,3.36,186.08,fear
you and i hope to have the absolute,184.64,2.8,187.44,fear
pleasure of speaking with you,186.08,13.76,199.84,
in the near future bye,187.44,12.4,199.84,
you,206.56,2.08,208.64000000000001,
