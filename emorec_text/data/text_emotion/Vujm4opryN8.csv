resistance. If you're insulin resistant",13.65,4.049,17.699,fear

carbohydrates you eat as fat. When you",17.699,4.051,21.75,fear

broken down and glucose is released into",21.75,5.279,27.029,fear

If you're insulin resistant you release 5",57.87,5.189,63.059,fear

fruits. A limit of 1 to 2 pieces a day is",144.24,5.91,150.15,fear
