hi my name is Heidi and I'm a pharmacist,5.15,4.45,9.600000000000001,happy
and today we'll be talking about how to,8.1,4.83,12.93,neutral
inject cloudy insulin before injecting,9.6,5.67,15.27,neutral
your insulin check the expiration date,12.93,5.34,18.27,neutral
to make sure it's not expired then,15.27,5.67,20.939999999999998,neutral
enroll the insulin between your hands,18.27,6.75,25.02,neutral
for fifteen to thirty seconds you never,20.94,6.03,26.970000000000002,neutral
want to shake insulin you always want to,25.02,9.09,34.11,happy
roll it to mix it after you're done,26.97,8.609,35.579,happy
check to make sure that there's nothing,34.11,6.84,40.95,neutral
settled at the bottom and then use an,35.579,9.901,45.480000000000004,neutral
alcohol swab to sterilize the top of the,40.95,10.41,51.36,sad
vial at this point take your syringe and,45.48,9.2,54.67999999999999,sad
roll the cap from the needle,51.36,3.32,54.68,sad
and pull the plunger down to the amount,57.18,4.47,61.65,sad
of insulin that you intend to inject in,59.1,6.78,65.88,sad
this case I intend to inject 20 units so,61.65,8.43,70.08,neutral
I pull the plunger down to 20 then I'm,65.88,5.88,71.75999999999999,neutral
going to stick the needle into the vial,70.08,7.2,77.28,sad
I press down on the plunger to inject,71.76,8.52,80.28,sad
the air into the vial turn the whole,77.28,7.37,84.65,sad
thing over and then pull the plunger,80.28,8.94,89.22,sad
back to 20 if you have bubbles in the,84.65,5.469,90.119,sad
syringe,89.22,5.009,94.229,sad
you can pull past 20 and then push back,90.119,6.871,96.99,sad
up to push the bubbles back into the,94.229,7.321,101.55,sad
vial then turn the whole thing over,96.99,9.72,106.71,sad
again and pull the needle out at this,101.55,8.22,109.77,sad
point you're ready to inject insulin can,106.71,4.65,111.36,sad
be injected into the upper arm the,109.77,4.92,114.69,sad
abdomen or the thigh make sure that,111.36,5.46,116.82,sad
you're rotating sites within the site so,114.69,3.599,118.289,sad
that you're not injecting exactly the,116.82,4.73,121.55,sad
same spot each time,118.289,3.261,121.55,sad
when you are injecting make sure you go,123.75,6.33,130.08,sad
in at a 90 degree angle to the skin,126.04,4.04,130.08,sad
let's the needle in the skin press down,131.16,6.01,137.17,sad
on the plunger until all of the insulin,135.31,10.89,146.2,sad
is injected then wait 5 seconds and then,137.17,13.59,150.76,sad
withdraw the needle place the whole,146.2,7.62,153.82,sad
syringe into a sharps container if you,150.76,4.5,155.26,sad
have more questions about injecting,153.82,3.66,157.48,sad
insulin please contact your pharmacist,155.26,5.36,160.62,sad
