hi I'm Charlotte Lawson a registered and licensed dietitian you might be wondering how to determine the glycemic index of a certain food well first keep in mind that glycemic,0.0,20.549999999999997,20.549999999999997,angry
index is really just a scale rating and how the blood sugar in your and your system is affected by certain foods that we eat now you might have to do a little research because the glycemic index,10.679,20.659999999999997,31.339,angry
really is a chart and these foods have already been scientifically tested to find that certain number now also keep in mind the glycemic index is really just a guideline the systems not totally,20.81,24.641,45.45099999999999,angry
proven nor foolproof now if you're looking for a certain calculation you can determine the glycemic load of a certain food you do need to have the glycemic index number and a little bit,33.03,22.470000000000002,55.5,angry
of information from the Nutrition Facts label this simple calculation is the GI number times the amount of grams of carbohydrate there is per foot in that food divided by 100 and again this is,44.85,26.369000000000003,71.21900000000001,angry
glycemic load not the glycemic index number but this really is kind of giving you a perception on how much that insulin might rise in your system now for an example a banana has a glycemic,57.78,23.93,81.71000000000001,angry
index of 52 and 20 percent by volume carbohydrates so when plugging into that calculation the glycemic load of a banana is 10 then that's just a little bit of an example again the glycemic,68.88,25.330000000000002,94.21,angry
load not glycemic index and you will have to look up that chart to find specific foods as glycemic index is not going to be listed on a package on the Nutrition Facts label hopefully that'll,82.049,20.369,102.418,NA
point you in the right direction I'm Charlotte and it happy,92.939,9.46,102.399,NA
