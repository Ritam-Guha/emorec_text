hi I'm Charlotte Lawson a registered and,0.0,4.95,4.95,fear
licensed dietitian you might be,2.879,3.841,6.720000000000001,fear
wondering how to determine the glycemic,4.95,3.63,8.58,NA
index of a certain food,6.72,3.959,10.679,NA
well first keep in mind that glycemic,8.58,4.17,12.75,surprise
index is really just a scale rating and,10.679,4.29,14.969000000000001,surprise
how the blood sugar in your and your,12.75,3.96,16.71,NA
system is affected by certain foods that,14.969,4.081,19.05,NA
we eat now you might have to do a little,16.71,4.1,20.810000000000002,NA
research because the glycemic index,19.05,4.229,23.279,NA
really is a chart and these foods have,20.81,4.959,25.769,NA
already been scientifically tested to,23.279,4.861,28.14,sad
find that certain number now also keep,25.769,4.621,30.39,sad
in mind the glycemic index is really,28.14,4.89,33.03,NA
just a guideline the systems not totally,30.39,5.31,35.7,NA
proven nor foolproof now if you're,33.03,4.89,37.92,NA
looking for a certain calculation you,35.7,4.5,40.2,NA
can determine the glycemic load of a,37.92,4.319,42.239000000000004,NA
certain food you do need to have the,40.2,4.65,44.85,fear
glycemic index number and a little bit,42.239,4.111,46.349999999999994,sad
of information from the Nutrition Facts,44.85,4.83,49.68,fear
label this simple calculation is the GI,46.35,6.45,52.800000000000004,NA
number times the amount of grams of,49.68,5.1,54.78,NA
carbohydrate there is per foot in that,52.8,4.98,57.78,NA
food divided by 100 and again this is,54.78,5.009,59.789,NA
glycemic load not the glycemic index,57.78,4.349,62.129000000000005,NA
number but this really is kind of giving,59.789,4.26,64.049,NA
you a perception on how much that,62.129,4.17,66.29899999999999,NA
insulin might rise in your system now,64.049,4.831,68.88000000000001,surprise
for an example a banana has a glycemic,66.299,6.32,72.619,neutral
index of 52 and 20 percent by volume,68.88,6.12,75.0,NA
carbohydrates so when plugging into that,72.619,4.721,77.34,NA
calculation the glycemic load of a,75.0,5.28,80.28,NA
banana is 10 then that's just a little,77.34,4.709,82.049,NA
bit of an example again the glycemic,80.28,4.5,84.78,NA
load not glycemic index and you will,82.049,3.991,86.04,NA
have to look up that chart to find,84.78,4.019,88.799,NA
specific foods as glycemic index is not,86.04,4.77,90.81,NA
going to be listed on a package on the,88.799,4.14,92.93900000000001,NA
Nutrition Facts label hopefully that'll,90.81,3.449,94.259,NA
point you in the right direction,92.939,5.39,98.329,NA
I'm Charlotte and it happy,94.259,4.07,98.32900000000001,NA
