[Music] you well this is a study looking at pioglitazone which is a thiazolidinedione and our notion was to,1.34,22.079,23.419,NA
"use this drug before patients develop diabetes because we were convinced that this drug had anti atherosclerosis so recruited nearly 4,000 patients with recent TI a or stroke randomized them to",31.82,24.029999999999998,55.849999999999994,NA
pioglitazone or placebo and follow them for about four or five years and what we found was a 24% risk reduction in future Mir stroke I think this study confirms what we thought all along that,44.3,23.789,68.089,NA
pioglitazone this thiazolidinedione has potent anti-authority effects you so pioglitazone a thiazolidinedione is an insulin sensitizing drug and it has,55.58,25.017999999999997,80.598,NA
protein effects on multiple cardiovascular risk factors obviously insulin resistance will improve glucose levels drop a few points as does blood pressure there are beneficial effects on,78.98,24.599999999999998,103.58,happy
certain lipid parameters and CRP levels a marker of inflammation also is reduced it's still not clear exactly which of those mechanisms actually translates to the cardiovascular benefits at this,90.65,25.740000000000002,116.39000000000001,happy
meeting we presented a mediation analysis where we tried to determine which of the individual risk factor benefits from pioglitazone actually mediated the effect and we couldn't find,104.24,23.22,127.46,NA
a single change in any of these covariates that translated to the benefit HDL cholesterol increases by a few points and that seemed to mediate about 25% of the risk reduction and,115.07,27.720000000000002,142.79,NA
there were minor contributions from blood pressure and triglycerides glucose as well as CRP and as a composite when we put all of these Cove areas together we could explain about 50% of the,129.56,23.160000000000004,152.72,happy
benefit but still the majority of the benefit remains undisclosed you well here I think the data are more clear again this is an insulin,140.6,19.79,160.39,NA
sensitizing drug and it's been demonstrated in previous trials to reduce the progression from pre-diabetes to diabetes so in iris we showed that in this,160.63,20.82,181.45,NA
insulin resistant cohort of patients there was greater than a 50% reduction in the progression to diabetes most of the benefit actually occurred in those patients that already had pre-diabetes,171.29,26.23,197.51999999999998,happy
so the sense here is that by reducing in some resistance offloading the beta cell you will lead to less diabetes over time you so pioglitazone first of all is not,183.68,23.97,207.65,NA
marketed in the United States for either insulin resistance or pre-diabetes it's only on the market for patients with diabetes so this was really an exploratory investigation the question,205.77,22.290000000000003,228.06,NA
is can it be extrapolated to other T CDs first of all pioglitazone is the only tzd in the United States that's widely prescribed rosiglitazone had some controversy a number of years ago and,216.66,23.4,240.06,NA
while it's still available is essentially rarely prescribed I will say that when investigators have looked at the comparative benefits between pioglitazone and rosiglitazone,228.9,23.42,252.32,NA
pioglitazone always seems to have some advantage over rosiglitazone whether it's based on cardiovascular risk and diabetes patients or on lipid parameters so I would say that we cannot,239.73,22.55,262.28,NA
extrapolate to any tzd [Music],251.79,18.038,269.828,NA
