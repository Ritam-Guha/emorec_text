[Music],1.34,6.999,8.339,
you,19.83,2.06,21.889999999999997,
well this is a study looking at,25.37,3.99,29.36,fear
pioglitazone which is a,27.95,3.87,31.82,fear
thiazolidinedione and our notion was to,29.36,5.16,34.519999999999996,fear
use this drug before patients develop,31.82,4.26,36.08,fear
diabetes because we were convinced that,34.52,3.99,38.510000000000005,angry
this drug had anti atherosclerosis,36.08,5.52,41.599999999999994,angry
"so recruited nearly 4,000 patients with",38.51,5.79,44.3,angry
recent TI a or stroke randomized them to,41.6,4.47,46.07,angry
pioglitazone or placebo and follow them,44.3,3.93,48.23,fear
for about four or five years and what we,46.07,5.73,51.8,fear
found was a 24% risk reduction in future,48.23,5.759,53.989,fear
Mir stroke I think this study confirms,51.8,3.78,55.58,
what we thought all along that,53.989,4.59,58.57899999999999,
pioglitazone this thiazolidinedione has,55.58,7.159,62.739,
potent anti-authority effects,58.579,4.16,62.739000000000004,neutral
you,68.92,2.059,70.979,neutral
so pioglitazone a thiazolidinedione is,72.65,6.33,78.98,fear
an insulin sensitizing drug and it has,75.53,5.31,80.84,fear
protein effects on multiple,78.98,4.02,83.0,neutral
cardiovascular risk factors obviously,80.84,5.01,85.85000000000001,neutral
insulin resistance will improve glucose,83.0,5.52,88.52,neutral
levels drop a few points as does blood,85.85,4.8,90.64999999999999,neutral
pressure there are beneficial effects on,88.52,5.25,93.77,neutral
certain lipid parameters and CRP levels,90.65,5.49,96.14,neutral
a marker of inflammation also is reduced,93.77,5.28,99.05,neutral
it's still not clear exactly which of,96.14,6.12,102.26,neutral
those mechanisms actually translates to,99.05,5.19,104.24,neutral
the cardiovascular benefits at this,102.26,3.66,105.92,neutral
meeting we presented a mediation,104.24,3.3,107.53999999999999,neutral
analysis where we tried to determine,105.92,4.71,110.63,neutral
which of the individual risk factor,107.54,5.37,112.91000000000001,neutral
benefits from pioglitazone actually,110.63,4.44,115.07,neutral
mediated the effect and we couldn't find,112.91,5.4,118.31,neutral
a single change in any of these,115.07,6.12,121.19,neutral
covariates that translated to the,118.31,6.0,124.31,
benefit HDL cholesterol increases by a,121.19,5.55,126.74,neutral
few points and that seemed to mediate,124.31,5.25,129.56,neutral
about 25% of the risk reduction and,126.74,4.8,131.54,neutral
there were minor contributions from,129.56,4.41,133.97,neutral
blood pressure and triglycerides glucose,131.54,5.28,136.82,neutral
as well as CRP and as a composite when,133.97,4.32,138.29,neutral
we put all of these Cove areas together,136.82,3.78,140.6,neutral
we could explain about 50% of the,138.29,5.37,143.66,neutral
benefit but still the majority of the,140.6,6.38,146.98,neutral
benefit remains undisclosed,143.66,3.32,146.98,sad
you,153.21,2.06,155.27,fear
well here I think the data are more,156.83,3.8,160.63000000000002,
clear again this is an insulin,158.66,4.23,162.89,
sensitizing drug and it's been,160.63,4.45,165.07999999999998,neutral
demonstrated in previous trials to,162.89,4.77,167.66,neutral
reduce the progression from pre-diabetes,165.08,3.69,168.77,neutral
to diabetes,167.66,3.63,171.29,neutral
so in iris we showed that in this,168.77,4.28,173.05,neutral
insulin resistant cohort of patients,171.29,5.1,176.39,neutral
there was greater than a 50% reduction,173.05,6.76,179.81,neutral
in the progression to diabetes most of,176.39,5.22,181.60999999999999,neutral
the benefit actually occurred in those,179.81,3.87,183.68,neutral
patients that already had pre-diabetes,181.61,5.28,186.89000000000001,neutral
so the sense here is that by reducing in,183.68,5.61,189.29000000000002,neutral
some resistance offloading the beta cell,186.89,7.13,194.01999999999998,neutral
you will lead to less diabetes over time,189.29,4.73,194.01999999999998,neutral
you,200.5,2.06,202.56,neutral
so pioglitazone first of all is not,203.67,4.44,208.10999999999999,
marketed in the United States for either,205.77,4.62,210.39000000000001,
insulin resistance or pre-diabetes it's,208.11,3.84,211.95000000000002,
only on the market for patients with,210.39,3.09,213.48,NA
diabetes so this was really an,211.95,4.71,216.66,NA
exploratory investigation the question,213.48,6.03,219.51,NA
is can it be extrapolated to other T CDs,216.66,5.36,222.02,NA
first of all pioglitazone is the only,219.51,4.98,224.48999999999998,NA
tzd in the United States that's widely,222.02,5.14,227.16,NA
prescribed rosiglitazone had some,224.49,4.41,228.9,NA
controversy a number of years ago and,227.16,3.51,230.67,NA
while it's still available is,228.9,5.07,233.97,NA
essentially rarely prescribed I will say,230.67,5.789,236.45899999999997,NA
that when investigators have looked at,233.97,4.44,238.41,NA
the comparative benefits between,236.459,3.271,239.73,NA
pioglitazone and rosiglitazone,238.41,4.85,243.26,NA
pioglitazone always seems to have some,239.73,5.94,245.67,NA
advantage over rosiglitazone whether,243.26,4.36,247.62,NA
it's based on cardiovascular risk and,245.67,4.71,250.38,NA
diabetes patients or on lipid parameters,247.62,4.17,251.79,NA
so I would say that we cannot,250.38,3.37,253.75,NA
extrapolate to any tzd,251.79,9.999,261.789,NA
