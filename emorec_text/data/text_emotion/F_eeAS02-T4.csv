this particular patient has a retinal,5.75,6.16,11.91,fear
changes called diabetic retinopathy,9.99,5.279,15.269,NA
which are due to having had diabetes for,11.91,6.09,18.0,NA
a number of years the scan on the left,15.269,6.541,21.810000000000002,NA
is is an Oct scan optical computerized,18.0,6.06,24.06,NA
tomography which effectively takes a,21.81,4.67,26.479999999999997,NA
cross-sectional look through the retina,24.06,6.059,30.119,NA
and what we can see here is that the,26.48,6.759,33.239000000000004,NA
retina has little dark areas within it,30.119,5.641,35.76,NA
the redness a bit thickened due to fluid,33.239,4.531,37.769999999999996,NA
within the retina and this is because,35.76,4.47,40.23,NA
with diabetes over a number of years it,37.77,4.559,42.329,NA
can just damage the little capillaries,40.23,4.309,44.538999999999994,NA
in the retina and make them leaky and,42.329,5.431,47.76,NA
the fluid in the retina can make the,44.539,5.5,50.039,NA
vision quite blurred and make it,47.76,4.68,52.44,NA
difficult to read small print or see,50.039,4.441,54.480000000000004,NA
insulin if you need to inject insulin of,52.44,4.77,57.209999999999994,NA
your diabetic this particular patient,54.48,6.0,60.48,NA
has been treated with in the last year,57.21,5.759,62.969,NA
with a monoclonal antibody against a,60.48,4.259,64.739,NA
growth factor which was a hugely,62.969,3.781,66.75,NA
important development that has come as a,64.739,3.63,68.369,NA
result of a number of years of clinical,66.75,3.9,70.65,NA
research but what we were finding with,68.369,4.591,72.96,NA
her was that the treatment was working,70.65,4.53,75.18,NA
very well but wasn't lasting for a very,72.96,4.65,77.61,NA
long time in particular because she's,75.18,4.799,79.97900000000001,NA
had some surgery before to her I called,77.61,4.439,82.049,NA
a vitrectomy which means that the drug,79.979,4.53,84.509,NA
doesn't last for very long in the eye so,82.049,4.89,86.93900000000001,NA
we've just given her a very novel,84.509,4.5,89.009,NA
treatment which we were involved in one,86.939,4.561,91.5,NA
of the clinical trials for it was a,89.009,4.741,93.75,NA
multicenter trial done in the USA and,91.5,6.72,98.22,NA
Europe and this drug is a clever slow,93.75,5.7,99.45,NA
release preparation of an,98.22,2.969,101.189,NA
anti-inflammatory treatment that you can,99.45,4.44,103.89,NA
inject into the eye and it slowly slowly,101.189,6.151,107.33999999999999,NA
releases on a daily basis the drug in,103.89,5.64,109.53,NA
very small quantities and it can act for,107.34,4.38,111.72,NA
up to three years so this is hugely,109.53,4.32,113.85,NA
altered the quality of life of this,111.72,4.109,115.829,NA
patient is significantly reduced to,113.85,3.449,117.29899999999999,NA
fluid at the back of the eye and as,115.829,2.97,118.79899999999999,NA
meant that rather than needing to come,117.299,3.631,120.93,NA
back for monthly injections they've been,118.799,4.441,123.24000000000001,NA
able to be assessed much less frequently,120.93,4.71,125.64,NA
and haven't needed any recent treatments,123.24,4.44,127.67999999999999,NA
this is a very good example where this,125.64,4.649,130.289,NA
particular patient ten years ago would,127.68,4.74,132.42000000000002,NA
have probably been registered as,130.289,3.661,133.95,NA
certainly partially sighted,132.42,4.2,136.61999999999998,NA
not blind and now they're having a very,133.95,4.5,138.45,NA
good quality of life so there have been,136.62,3.509,140.129,NA
huge developments over the last 10 years,138.45,3.509,141.95899999999997,NA
and we're not static that you know we,140.129,3.241,143.37,NA
are where we are at the moment the,141.959,3.0,144.959,NA
treatments are not perfect and there's,143.37,3.509,146.879,NA
always more that can be done even if,144.959,3.331,148.29,NA
it's just improving the treatment,146.879,4.771,151.64999999999998,NA
regimes rather than the actual outcomes,148.29,5.1,153.39,NA
it may be that we could see people less,151.65,4.53,156.18,NA
often or not have to give so much,153.39,4.2,157.58999999999997,NA
treatment to it to the eye,156.18,11.6,167.78,NA
