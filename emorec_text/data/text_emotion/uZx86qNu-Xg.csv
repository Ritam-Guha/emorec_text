"I'd like to talk a little bit about finding the 
right optimal diet and nutrition plan for you  ",8.88,4.4,13.280000000000001,happy
"for women that have polycystic ovary syndrome. 
The long story short is that it has been studied  ",14.0,4.32,18.32,happy
"to see if there is one optimal diet plan that 
will fit every woman that has PCOS and for better  ",18.32,5.36,23.68,happy
"or worse, the answer is no. Many healthy diets 
can do the trick and really it's just a matter  ",23.68,4.88,28.56,neutral
"of figuring out what works best for you and is 
sustainable over the long run. But let's dive  ",28.56,4.96,33.519999999999996,happy
"into some of the key factors that underlie all 
of these things, in general. PCOS, or polycystic  ",33.52,5.12,38.64,neutral

inflammation inside of the body and potentially  ",38.64,5.44,44.08,neutral

that deals with any sugars or carbohydrates  ",44.08,4.4,48.48,neutral
"that we get in our diet and so watching the 
carbohydrate consumption is definitely a key  ",48.48,4.0,52.48,neutral
"point of any of the PCOS-friendly diets. That 
being said, in general, studies have supported  ",52.48,5.84,58.31999999999999,neutral
"the notion of kind of a pro-fertility diet very 
similar to what we think of in the united states  ",58.32,4.24,62.56,neutral
"as a Mediterranean-style diet and whether or 
not you're actively trying to get pregnant,  ",62.56,4.32,66.88,neutral
"I think that this diet is really optimal for women 
with PCOS as well. There are a few key categories  ",66.88,5.52,72.39999999999999,neutral
"we think about with regards to this diet and we 
can run through them together. The first is being  ",72.4,4.8,77.2,neutral
"very planned forward, so in general trying to get 
lots of fresh vegetables and fruits in the diet  ",77.2,4.8,82.0,neutral
"that whole eat the rainbow idea really helps 
us to get lots of antioxidants into the diet  ",82.0,5.04,87.04,neutral
"and a supplement of vitamins and minerals the way 
we were meant to ingest them. As human beings,  ",87.04,4.0,91.04,neutral
"taking a vitamin supplement can be very helpful 
but getting these vitamins and minerals straight  ",91.84,4.56,96.4,neutral
"from your diet is definitely the best. In general, 
this concept also helps to further the concept of  ",96.4,5.6,102.0,neutral
"a whole food diet and having whole foods rather 
than processed or packaged foods anything that  ",102.0,6.32,108.32,neutral
"comes in a box or a bag or you have to go through 
a drive through to get it is probably less than  ",108.32,4.64,112.96,neutral
"ideal. And those should really be minimized in the 
diet. So again, plan forward vegetables and fruits  ",112.96,5.28,118.24,neutral
"is really helpful in the carbohydrates category. 
This is another area we really have to focus on  ",118.24,5.12,123.36,neutral
"watching our sugars. Sugar is very insidious in 
the American diet and it's really important to  ",123.36,4.8,128.16,neutral
"get a sense of the things that you eat regularly 
to look at the sugar content of those foods.  ",128.16,4.56,132.72,neutral
"In general, I talk to my patients about a couple 
key areas that sugar can get into the diet.  ",133.28,4.08,137.36,neutral
"Certainly sugar sweet beverages like sodas juices 
should probably really just be eliminated from the  ",138.0,4.88,142.88,neutral
"diet and you can work slowly but steadily 
towards that goal. If you're putting lots  ",142.88,4.4,147.28,neutral
"of sugar in coffee or tea or you're drinking 
sweetened beverages from a coffee shop, that's  ",147.28,5.2,152.48,neutral
"another area where you could keep getting a lot of 
sugar and not quite realizing it and then finally  ",152.48,5.68,158.16,neutral
"those white refined white flour products, 
like white rice white bread and white pasta  ",158.16,5.28,163.44,neutral
"are unfortunately something that we should 
be thinking about with moderation as well.  ",163.44,3.44,166.88,neutral
"In general, it's preferred to use more whole 
grains and to use portion control as a big  ",167.44,5.28,172.72,neutral
"component of controlling our carbohydrate 
consumption. That's definitely an area to  ",172.72,5.2,177.92,neutral
"focus on for women that have PCOS. Reducing 
those carbohydrates especially those refined  ",177.92,4.64,182.55999999999997,neutral
"white flour products can go a long way in terms 
of improving your symptoms as relates to PCOS.  ",182.56,4.96,187.52,neutral
"Now that being said, low fat is not necessarily 
required unless you have a cholesterol issue as  ",188.16,5.28,193.44,neutral

avocados, nuts, nut butters, are actually really  ",193.44,5.12,198.56,neutral

a snack or a meal and i think are very important  ",198.56,4.24,202.8,neutral

perspective. I think plant forward is always  ",202.8,4.96,207.76000000000002,neutral
"helpful but going full on vegetarian is not 
necessarily required. It's important to watch  ",207.76,4.96,212.72,neutral
"and see how you respond to different foods how you 
feel after you eat different things. In general,  ",212.72,4.64,217.35999999999999,neutral
"some women with PCOS might find that they don't 
respond well to dairy or to meat products,  ",217.36,4.32,221.68,neutral
"but it's not required that every woman that 
has PCOS go dairy-free or gluten-free for that  ",222.48,4.4,226.88,neutral
"matter. It's really a matter of watching your 
body and how you feel. If you eat something and  ",226.88,4.16,231.04,neutral
"you feel very bloated afterwards or uncomfortable 
or having pain, that's a sign that maybe you need  ",231.04,4.64,235.67999999999998,neutral
"to dial back on that particular food. So, to that 
end as you're thinking about changing your diet,  ",235.68,4.96,240.64000000000001,neutral
"there are a lot of different ways to do it. And 
ultimately, I always say that the key component  ",240.64,5.28,245.92,neutral
"is that it should be a sustainable change many of 
my patients ask me about things like keto or other  ",245.92,5.28,251.2,neutral

over the long run, it's not a good choice for you  ",251.2,4.96,256.15999999999997,neutral

figuring out the right plan has to be a mix or a  ",256.16,5.6,261.76000000000005,neutral
"sort of a combination of what resources you have 
from a time, money, and energy standpoint. You  ",261.76,5.12,266.88,neutral
"could look to certain books or other resources 
that I share with my patients that have laid out  ",266.88,4.24,271.12,neutral
"plans by experts for women that have PCOS that 
make it easy. They give you a blueprint of what  ",271.12,5.04,276.16,neutral

figure it out yourself, but that will require a  ",276.16,4.4,280.56,neutral

what foods you respond to will also really help.  ",285.92,4.56,290.48,neutral
