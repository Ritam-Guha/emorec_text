hi i'm simon Fisto from fist and,7.57,4.319,11.889,sad
performance gearboxes today we're going,9.969,3.361,13.33,sad
to drive three vehicles all fitted with,11.889,4.14,16.029,sad
PPG gearboxes today's exercise is to,13.33,3.99,17.32,sad
dispute the myth that a lot of people,16.029,2.791,18.82,sad
believe you can't drive a dog box in a,17.32,4.41,21.73,sad
street car and our own company vehicle,18.82,5.7,24.52,sad
said a dog box in it for probably best,21.73,4.65,26.380000000000003,sad
"part of four years now we've done 20,000",24.52,4.649,29.169,fear
caves with it cars fine and most of its,26.38,5.07,31.45,neutral
application is used for street use let's,29.169,4.051,33.22,neutral
jump on the vehicles and show you how it,31.45,4.05,35.5,neutral
goes and my recommendation to most,33.22,4.65,37.87,NA
people is your traffic lights you're,35.5,4.08,39.58,NA
ready to get go put your foot on the,37.87,5.07,42.94,neutral
clutch count 1 2 3 in the gear 9 times,39.58,4.74,44.32,neutral
zero to 10 you won't even hear it go,42.94,3.0,45.94,neutral
inside fingers crossed,44.32,5.64,49.96,NA
try it out 1 2 3 small come and we're,45.94,6.11,52.05,NA
off,49.96,2.09,52.05,NA
I've normally found that by the slower,52.94,5.07,58.01,NA
you drive the slower you change gears as,55.339,4.171,59.51,neutral
you can see you will hear a little bit,58.01,4.349,62.358999999999995,neutral
of a clunk clunk or a bang that's,59.51,6.12,65.63,neutral
nothing to be concerned about and when,62.359,6.15,68.509,neutral
you start hearing like a lot of clunks,65.63,4.5,70.13,NA
in a row like a machine gun going off or,68.509,2.97,71.479,NA
something like that that's the dogs,70.13,3.05,73.17999999999999,NA
bouncing over the top of each other and,71.479,5.25,76.729,NA
that's when you incur the most potential,73.18,6.25,79.43,NA
damage the slower you drive you know you,76.729,5.101,81.83,NA
can change gears in a slow fashion my,79.43,3.78,83.21000000000001,NA
recommendation to anyone who goes our,81.83,2.069,83.899,NA
new gear box,83.21,2.24,85.44999999999999,NA
my new dog box never driven one before,83.899,3.72,87.619,NA
as you can see just roll over like a,85.45,3.97,89.42,NA
normal car you know when you get it,87.619,4.741,92.36,NA
right it's effortless you know we have,89.42,4.77,94.19,NA
many customers whose girlfriends and,92.36,3.539,95.899,NA
mothers drive around and once they,94.19,3.989,98.179,NA
become accustomed to it and you know it,95.899,5.241,101.14,NA
really doesn't take long,98.179,2.961,101.14,NA
first gear second gear there was a,102.7,5.69,108.39,NA
little bit of a clock that was just me,105.58,6.78,112.36,NA
third fourth there you go 50 keys for,108.39,5.97,114.36,NA
cruising down the road legal speed limit,112.36,4.77,117.13,NA
no no one's the wiser it's a lot of,114.36,4.54,118.9,NA
misconception people that people believe,117.13,3.18,120.31,NA
are you know you've got to get in it and,118.9,3.23,122.13000000000001,NA
you've got to drive it like you hate it,120.31,3.96,124.27,NA
okay look maybe when you when you're,122.13,3.489,125.619,NA
having a big guy when you're racing or,124.27,2.459,126.729,NA
you're doing some club Sprint's or,125.619,3.36,128.979,NA
something like that yes,126.729,3.75,130.47899999999998,NA
driving around the street you don't as,128.979,3.51,132.489,NA
you can see you'll see today driving,130.479,5.101,135.58,NA
these three vehicles they're very simple,132.489,6.061,138.55,NA
to drive very easy we put a lot of,135.58,4.59,140.17000000000002,NA
effort a lot of design time into making,138.55,3.21,141.76000000000002,NA
them easy to drive because we're aware,140.17,3.599,143.76899999999998,NA
of a lot of our customers use them in a,141.76,4.5,146.26,NA
street application as everyone's aware,143.769,6.411,150.18,NA
you can flat shifting gear box,146.26,3.92,150.17999999999998,NA
and as mentioned the faster you drive,151.8,3.6,155.4,neutral
the fast you should change and I will,153.51,5.07,158.57999999999998,NA
sort up in the RPM a little bit and the,155.4,6.12,161.52,NA
clutch was changing very simple very,158.58,4.26,162.84,NA
easy all you need to do when you're,161.52,3.72,165.24,NA
changing without the clutch just you're,162.84,4.08,166.92000000000002,NA
in third gear for example you're on the,165.24,4.83,170.07000000000002,NA
accelerator just a quick lift off the,166.92,4.86,171.78,NA
accelerator put on the stick at the same,170.07,7.86,177.93,NA
time Snickers I'll go back to third you,171.78,8.31,180.09,NA
know overdoing not a lot 4000 rpm just,177.93,6.24,184.17000000000002,NA
for example as you can see that's really,180.09,5.21,185.3,NA
quite simple,184.17,4.41,188.57999999999998,NA
I'll do it again actually with one,185.3,4.8,190.10000000000002,NA
finger,188.58,4.41,192.99,NA
there's not a lot of low it's only two,190.1,4.45,194.54999999999998,NA
hands on the gears that you don't need,192.99,3.36,196.35000000000002,NA
to break the gear stick off but a lot of,194.55,3.96,198.51000000000002,NA
time a lot of effort into making the,196.35,5.97,202.32,NA
thing usable for the everyday driver you,198.51,5.64,204.14999999999998,NA
can drive to the track and do your club,202.32,3.36,205.68,NA
days you can do your club Sprint's you,204.15,2.88,207.03,NA
can impress Aliya mates with your dog,205.68,3.63,209.31,NA
boxes and then you drive to work on,207.03,4.89,211.92,NA
Monday so slowing down is heel and,209.31,4.97,214.28,NA
target,211.92,2.36,214.28,NA
as you can see no clamps no bangs,216.09,4.41,220.5,NA
not doing big revs because we want to do,227.019,4.981,232.0,NA
the right thing but it indicates you can,229.06,5.429,234.489,NA
let shift them on a flat shifting as,232.0,3.84,235.84,NA
such you do need to take the load off,234.489,5.911,240.4,NA
the gearbox and we will soon as the,235.84,6.42,242.26,NA
loads off it'll go into gear as quick as,240.4,4.199,244.59900000000002,NA
