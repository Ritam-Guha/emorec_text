just a few minutes about something,2.669,3.601,6.27,fear
called a tenth assist nigricans,4.049,4.59,8.639,fear
what the heck is that if I have it what,6.27,4.38,10.649999999999999,fear
does it mean is it a big deal or not,8.639,4.551,13.19,fear
this is actually a very important,10.65,6.99,17.64,fear
medical sign it's a red flag for serious,13.19,6.61,19.8,fear
disease and I'm gonna describe what this,17.64,4.44,22.080000000000002,fear
is to you and I'm gonna tell you what,19.8,4.95,24.75,fear
you should do about this okay first of,22.08,4.35,26.43,fear
all if you know someone who has dark,24.75,4.73,29.48,fear
velvety patches of kind of raised,26.43,6.42,32.85,fear
leathery feeling velvety feeling skin on,29.48,6.13,35.61,fear
their neck under their armpits in their,32.85,4.83,37.68,fear
groin even around their navel sometimes,35.61,4.5,40.11,fear
rarely on the face then please share,37.68,4.23,41.91,fear
this video with them they need to know,40.11,3.359,43.469,fear
that that's actually a risk factor for,41.91,4.739,46.648999999999994,fear
very serious medical issues and you're,43.469,5.43,48.899,fear
sharing this could save them lots of,46.649,4.171,50.82,fear
suffering and maybe even save their life,48.899,4.111,53.01,happy
now let's talk about a can ptosis,50.82,4.71,55.53,fear
nigricans what the heck is it and what,53.01,5.16,58.17,fear
should you do so as we've said it's a,55.53,5.16,60.69,fear
it's a thickening of velvety darkness in,58.17,4.86,63.03,fear
the skin and there are five different,60.69,3.929,64.619,fear
types and I'm gonna go through each,63.03,3.15,66.18,fear
different type and tell you kind of what,64.619,3.54,68.159,fear
causes that and what if anything you can,66.18,4.56,70.74000000000001,fear
do about it but some you can do stuff,68.159,6.841,75.0,fear
about some you cannot so this is the one,70.74,6.09,76.83,fear
that either there are severe medical,75.0,4.049,79.049,neutral
issues that can cause this and so you,76.83,4.89,81.72,fear
need to know about this okay now type 1,79.049,5.341,84.39,fear
is familial which means you inherit it,81.72,4.35,86.07,fear
you can inherit this from your mom or,84.39,3.33,87.72,neutral
dad or it may be even skips a generation,86.07,4.56,90.63,fear
but you can get it genetically okay and,87.72,4.71,92.42999999999999,fear
that's usually a very mild case you'll,90.63,4.199,94.829,fear
be able to see it faintly on your neck,92.43,4.439,96.869,fear
or in your armpits maybe you're growing,94.829,5.341,100.16999999999999,neutral
but it's not very noticeable from a,96.869,4.981,101.85,neutral
distance people who are not medically,100.17,3.3,103.47,neutral
educated you usually won't even know it,101.85,2.85,104.69999999999999,neutral
they'll just think you've got darker,103.47,3.42,106.89,fear
skin there and it's usually not a sign,104.7,4.379,109.07900000000001,fear
of anything bad or serious but the,106.89,3.839,110.729,fear
problem is is you don't know if you have,109.079,4.68,113.75899999999999,fear
type 1 or familial or if you have one of,110.729,5.551,116.28,fear
the other four types now type 2 is,113.759,6.75,120.509,fear
caused by endocrine problems okay these,116.28,6.18,122.46000000000001,fear
are the glands in your body that secrete,120.509,3.72,124.229,fear
different hormones almost without,122.46,4.38,126.83999999999999,fear
exception it's caused by insulin,124.229,4.95,129.179,fear
resistance okay if you have an,126.84,4.53,131.37,neutral
overabundance of insulin in your system,129.179,4.231,133.41,neutral
from eating too many carbs they,131.37,4.94,136.31,fear
you can develop an endocrine or type-2 a,133.41,7.77,141.18,fear
can ptosis nigricans type 3 is obesity,136.31,7.3,143.61,fear
now again caused by insulin resistance,141.18,4.26,145.44,fear
caused by an overabundance of insulin,143.61,3.75,147.36,fear
and glucose in your system and it can,145.44,4.53,149.97,fear
lead to these dark patches and so that,147.36,6.03,153.39000000000001,fear
is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome,149.97,4.95,154.92,fear
if you have a cognate Ken ptosis,153.39,3.33,156.72,neutral
nigricans you're at increased risk for,154.92,4.5,159.42,neutral
PCOS for dementia for metabolic syndrome,156.72,5.58,162.3,neutral
for type 2 diabetes in fact a lot of,159.42,4.38,163.79999999999998,neutral
people that's how their diabetes is,162.3,3.24,165.54000000000002,fear
diagnosed is they have these dark,163.8,3.14,166.94,fear
patches and they go to a dermatologist,165.54,3.75,169.29,neutral
and he says oh you know what let's check,166.94,4.66,171.6,fear
a blood sugar and a fasting insulin,169.29,4.49,173.78,fear
level and a c-peptide and sure enough,171.6,4.95,176.54999999999998,fear
there you go you got type 2 diabetes and,173.78,4.75,178.53,fear
you didn't even know it hey Ken thoses,176.55,5.07,181.62,neutral
nigricans can be the kind of red flag,178.53,4.8,183.33,neutral
that lets you know that something's,181.62,5.1,186.72,fear
wrong type 4 can be is caused by drugs,183.33,5.28,188.61,fear
different drugs the most common of which,186.72,4.53,191.25,fear
are the steroids the corticosteroids,188.61,4.14,192.75,fear
like prednisone medrol,191.25,4.02,195.27,neutral
methylprednisolone all of those kind of,192.75,4.11,196.86,neutral
guys if you take high doses for long,195.27,4.56,199.83,neutral
periods of time can lead to a can ptosis,196.86,6.12,202.98000000000002,neutral
nigricans and so basically again that's,199.83,5.75,205.58,fear
because they cause chronically elevated,202.98,5.67,208.64999999999998,fear
insulin and blood sugar right also if,205.58,5.65,211.23000000000002,fear
you take super high doses of niacin it,208.65,5.94,214.59,fear
can cause a in or a can ptosis nigricans,211.23,6.54,217.76999999999998,fear
also if you take oral contraceptives,214.59,5.76,220.35,fear
they can sometimes rarely lead to this,217.77,6.0,223.77,neutral
condition okay now type 5 very very,220.35,6.06,226.41,fear
important a can ptosis nigricans can,223.77,5.85,229.62,fear
also be a red flag for cancer yeah,226.41,5.85,232.26,fear
malignancy can lead to these dark,229.62,5.19,234.81,fear
velvety patches on your neck or under,232.26,4.29,236.54999999999998,fear
your arms or in your growing sometimes,234.81,3.39,238.2,fear
rarely around the navel or even on the,236.55,3.93,240.48000000000002,fear
face but usually it's the neck and the,238.2,5.52,243.72,fear
armpits is where it shows up and so if,240.48,4.83,245.31,fear
you have any cancer of the,243.72,3.63,247.35,fear
gastrointestinal system the stomach the,245.31,4.56,249.87,neutral
liver the pancreas that can cause a can,247.35,4.41,251.76,fear
ptosis nigricans if you have,249.87,5.04,254.91,fear
genitourinary bladder kidneys ureters,251.76,5.61,257.37,fear
that can also lead to it if you have any,254.91,4.949,259.859,fear
of the gynecological cancers ovarian,257.37,5.16,262.53000000000003,fear
fallopian tube uterine that can also,259.859,5.581,265.44,neutral
lead to a can ptosis nigricans so if you,262.53,4.47,267.0,fear

chronically elevated insulin type 2,271.5,5.25,276.75,neutral
diabetes pre-diabetes insulin resistance,273.66,6.96,280.62,fear
and you also if it comes on suddenly if,276.75,5.34,282.09,fear
you're not taking any of the drugs I,280.62,3.72,284.34000000000003,fear
mentioned in type 4 then you need to be,282.09,5.64,287.72999999999996,neutral
really scanned for cancer okay,284.34,6.75,291.09,neutral
