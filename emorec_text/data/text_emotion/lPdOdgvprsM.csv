hey guys in this video we're going to,0.03,3.24,3.27,surprise
answer the question what is normal blood,1.439,5.46,6.899,neutral
sugar levels okay a lot of times you've,3.27,6.27,9.54,neutral
been told that it's between 8090 but it,6.899,4.351,11.25,neutral
really according to the American,9.54,4.019,13.559,neutral
Diabetes Association it really depends,11.25,3.66,14.91,NA
on what year you're looking at because,13.559,5.191,18.75,NA
in 1925 it was a hundred basically,14.91,6.6,21.509999999999998,neutral
between 90 and 120 okay that was normal,18.75,7.769,26.519,neutral
in 1968 it was 130 then in 1978 it was,21.51,9.589,31.099000000000004,neutral
115 milligrams per deciliter okay and in,26.519,9.331,35.849999999999994,NA
1997 to 2003 it was 110 milligrams per,31.099,8.101,39.2,NA
deciliter and then between 2004 and 2007,35.85,7.049,42.899,NA
it's back to a hundred okay so my,39.2,6.07,45.27,NA
opinion is that you need it between 80,42.899,5.34,48.239000000000004,neutral
and 90 but up to a hundred but here's,45.27,5.64,50.910000000000004,neutral
the thing there's an amazing book that,48.239,4.32,52.559,neutral
I'm gonna recommend you can get as a,50.91,4.26,55.169999999999995,neutral
Kindle it's called diabetes epidemic in,52.559,6.151,58.709999999999994,NA
you by Joseph Kraft MD here's a guy that,55.17,7.77,62.94,neutral
"tested over 14,000 people over 25 years",58.71,8.82,67.53,neutral
and he evaluated their fasting blood,62.94,8.28,71.22,neutral
glucose levels and their glucose,67.53,7.409,74.93900000000001,neutral
tolerance test and their insulin levels,71.22,6.63,77.85,neutral
and he found something fascinating he,74.939,4.741,79.67999999999999,neutral
actually describes three patterns of,77.85,4.199,82.04899999999999,neutral
insulin okay so because he actually,79.68,5.49,85.17,neutral
checked fasting insulin and then post,82.049,6.601,88.65,neutral
meal insulin levels two three four I,85.17,6.15,91.32000000000001,neutral
think five hours and he found something,88.65,4.079,92.729,neutral
quite incredible,91.32,5.04,96.36,neutral
back in the 70s actually this is what he,92.729,7.381,100.11,neutral
found the absolute best indication for,96.36,7.91,104.27,neutral
pre-diabetes is not high fasting blood,100.11,8.88,108.99,neutral
sugars it is high fasting insulin levels,104.27,6.94,111.21,NA
okay in other words you can have normal,108.99,5.4,114.39,NA
fasting blood glucose levels and have,111.21,5.699,116.90899999999999,neutral
high insulin at the same time in fact,114.39,4.92,119.31,neutral
that was the case basically observed,116.909,4.82,121.72900000000001,neutral
that insulin high insulin comes first,119.31,7.019,126.32900000000001,NA
then it's the high sugar okay but here's,121.729,6.971,128.7,neutral
the problem the doctors aren't testing,126.329,4.77,131.099,neutral
the insulin levels it's one of the best,128.7,4.92,133.61999999999998,neutral
indicators for pre-diabetes,131.099,4.021,135.11999999999998,neutral
so check this out when you have high,133.62,2.759,136.379,NA
insulin levels what do you think that's,135.12,2.699,137.81900000000002,NA
gonna do to your blood sugars it's gonna,136.379,5.61,141.989,neutral
bring it down not up so high sugar is,137.819,6.721,144.54,neutral
not going to show up until later you,141.989,5.101,147.09,neutral
might more likely end up with low blood,144.54,5.13,149.67,neutral
sugar hypoglycemia especially if the,147.09,4.259,151.349,neutral
adrenals are weak but of course the,149.67,3.33,153.0,neutral
adrenals if your Drina 'ls are strong,151.349,4.621,155.97,neutral
enough it will counter the hypoglycemia,153.0,4.92,157.92,neutral
so it'll bring it to a normal range and,155.97,4.97,160.94,neutral
this can go on for 10 15 or more years,157.92,6.72,164.64,neutral
so here you are you have you get tested,160.94,5.409,166.349,neutral
you have normal blood sugars and you,164.64,3.179,167.819,neutral
think everything is fine but you have a,166.349,3.72,170.069,neutral
lot of other symptoms you're tired after,167.819,4.17,171.98899999999998,neutral
you eat you're fatigued you're getting,170.069,5.161,175.23,neutral
fat you know all the other symptoms but,171.989,6.12,178.109,neutral
your glucose levels are normal I would,175.23,4.83,180.06,neutral
recommend the next time you go to your,178.109,4.651,182.76000000000002,neutral
doctor get your fasting insulin test and,180.06,5.399,185.459,neutral
see where the level is at all right,182.76,3.69,186.45,neutral
thanks for watching,185.459,3.78,189.239,neutral
hey guys I want to personally invite you,186.45,4.379,190.82899999999998,neutral

started called dr. Berg's Kido and in a,190.829,5.97,196.799,neutral
minute fasting lab okay so I created,193.319,5.7,199.01899999999998,neutral
this so we can share our successful,196.799,4.381,201.18,neutral
actions what worked what didn't work,199.019,4.62,203.639,neutral
your results so I put a link down below,201.18,4.169,205.34900000000002,neutral
so go ahead and sign up and I'll see you,203.639,3.891,207.53,surprise
