hey guys in this video we're going to,0.03,3.24,3.27,surprise
answer the question what is normal blood,1.439,5.46,6.899,happy
sugar levels okay a lot of times you've,3.27,6.27,9.54,happy
been told that it's between 8090 but it,6.899,4.351,11.25,fear
really according to the American,9.54,4.019,13.559,fear
Diabetes Association it really depends,11.25,3.66,14.91,
on what year you're looking at because,13.559,5.191,18.75,fear
in 1925 it was a hundred basically,14.91,6.6,21.509999999999998,fear
between 90 and 120 okay that was normal,18.75,7.769,26.519,happy
in 1968 it was 130 then in 1978 it was,21.51,9.589,31.099000000000004,happy
115 milligrams per deciliter okay and in,26.519,9.331,35.849999999999994,happy
1997 to 2003 it was 110 milligrams per,31.099,8.101,39.2,happy
deciliter and then between 2004 and 2007,35.85,7.049,42.899,fear
it's back to a hundred okay so my,39.2,6.07,45.27,fear
opinion is that you need it between 80,42.899,5.34,48.239000000000004,happy
and 90 but up to a hundred but here's,45.27,5.64,50.910000000000004,happy
the thing there's an amazing book that,48.239,4.32,52.559,happy
I'm gonna recommend you can get as a,50.91,4.26,55.169999999999995,happy
Kindle it's called diabetes epidemic in,52.559,6.151,58.709999999999994,happy
you by Joseph Kraft MD here's a guy that,55.17,7.77,62.94,happy
"tested over 14,000 people over 25 years",58.71,8.82,67.53,happy
and he evaluated their fasting blood,62.94,8.28,71.22,happy
glucose levels and their glucose,67.53,7.409,74.93900000000001,happy
tolerance test and their insulin levels,71.22,6.63,77.85,happy
and he found something fascinating he,74.939,4.741,79.67999999999999,happy
actually describes three patterns of,77.85,4.199,82.04899999999999,fear
insulin okay so because he actually,79.68,5.49,85.17,fear
checked fasting insulin and then post,82.049,6.601,88.65,fear
meal insulin levels two three four I,85.17,6.15,91.32000000000001,fear
think five hours and he found something,88.65,4.079,92.729,happy
quite incredible,91.32,5.04,96.36,happy
back in the 70s actually this is what he,92.729,7.381,100.11,happy
found the absolute best indication for,96.36,7.91,104.27,happy
pre-diabetes is not high fasting blood,100.11,8.88,108.99,happy
sugars it is high fasting insulin levels,104.27,6.94,111.21,happy
okay in other words you can have normal,108.99,5.4,114.39,fear
fasting blood glucose levels and have,111.21,5.699,116.90899999999999,fear
high insulin at the same time in fact,114.39,4.92,119.31,fear
that was the case basically observed,116.909,4.82,121.72900000000001,surprise
that insulin high insulin comes first,119.31,7.019,126.32900000000001,fear
then it's the high sugar okay but here's,121.729,6.971,128.7,happy
the problem the doctors aren't testing,126.329,4.77,131.099,happy
the insulin levels it's one of the best,128.7,4.92,133.61999999999998,happy
indicators for pre-diabetes,131.099,4.021,135.11999999999998,
so check this out when you have high,133.62,2.759,136.379,
insulin levels what do you think that's,135.12,2.699,137.81900000000002,
gonna do to your blood sugars it's gonna,136.379,5.61,141.989,
bring it down not up so high sugar is,137.819,6.721,144.54,
not going to show up until later you,141.989,5.101,147.09,fear
might more likely end up with low blood,144.54,5.13,149.67,fear
sugar hypoglycemia especially if the,147.09,4.259,151.349,fear
adrenals are weak but of course the,149.67,3.33,153.0,fear
adrenals if your Drina 'ls are strong,151.349,4.621,155.97,fear
enough it will counter the hypoglycemia,153.0,4.92,157.92,fear
so it'll bring it to a normal range and,155.97,4.97,160.94,fear
this can go on for 10 15 or more years,157.92,6.72,164.64,fear
so here you are you have you get tested,160.94,5.409,166.349,fear
