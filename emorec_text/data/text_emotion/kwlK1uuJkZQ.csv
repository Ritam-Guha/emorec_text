hello everyone today I am here to share,15.46,5.079,20.539,neutral
some information about the most common,18.47,5.91,24.38,neutral
complaint I get to see in my obd namely,20.539,7.291,27.830000000000002,neutral
polycystic ovarian syndrome polycystic,24.38,6.139,30.519,neutral
ovarian syndrome is characterized by,27.83,6.659,34.489,neutral
irregular menstrual cycles by renaming,30.519,6.43,36.949,neutral
irregular menstrual cycles I mean and it,34.489,4.051,38.54,neutral
can range anytime anywhere between,36.949,4.5,41.449,neutral
absent menstrual cycles to prolong,38.54,5.85,44.39,neutral
menstrual cycles to irregular menstrual,41.449,6.061,47.51,neutral
cycles anything like that and it is,44.39,5.61,50.0,neutral
characterized by infertility this is one,47.51,4.35,51.86,neutral
of the most important cause for the,50.0,4.53,54.53,happy
female infertility hurting it is,51.86,6.87,58.73,happy
characterized by obesity and there is,54.53,7.38,61.910000000000004,fear
increased facial hair growth and they,58.73,5.94,64.67,neutral
have the oily skin and they also have a,61.91,3.599,65.509,neutral
thick,64.67,3.21,67.88,neutral
velvety patchy dark and kind of skin,65.509,4.441,69.95,fear
mostly near the neck and it is called as,67.88,5.73,73.61,neutral
acanthosis nigricans in medical terms so,69.95,6.48,76.43,neutral
what causes this polycystic ovarian,73.61,5.43,79.03999999999999,neutral
syndrome the exact cause is not known,76.43,5.18,81.61000000000001,neutral
but what we can hypothesize is it is an,79.04,6.78,85.82000000000001,neutral
amalgamation of genetic factors and the,81.61,7.09,88.7,neutral
lifestyle factors there is increased,85.82,5.189,91.00899999999999,neutral
androgens and insulin resistance in the,88.7,4.04,92.74000000000001,neutral
body of the women who suffer from,91.009,5.07,96.07900000000001,neutral
polycystic ovaries so what is this,92.74,5.83,98.57,neutral
insulin resistance until resistance,96.079,5.941,102.02,neutral
means that the body is not sensitive to,98.57,5.549,104.119,neutral
the amount of insulin which is being,102.02,3.87,105.89,neutral
produced in their body so the body is,104.119,4.411,108.53,neutral
forced produce more insulin to keep the,105.89,6.24,112.13,neutral
same glucose under check so what are,108.53,5.79,114.32000000000001,neutral
this androgens androgens are the male,112.13,4.98,117.11,neutral
hormones which are there in a normal,114.32,5.22,119.53999999999999,neutral
female also to an extent but in these,117.11,5.25,122.36,neutral
women the androgen levels are so much,119.54,4.53,124.07000000000001,neutral
more that they start having increased,122.36,4.71,127.07,neutral
facial hair growth and oily skin and all,124.07,6.509,130.579,neutral
that so what can this polycystic ovarian,127.07,8.16,135.23,neutral
syndrome cause as I told you it causes,130.579,6.571,137.15,neutral
infertility because of the increased,135.23,4.62,139.85,neutral
androgens it prevents egg getting renews,137.15,4.679,141.829,neutral
every month that affects the menstrual,139.85,3.24,143.09,neutral
cycles and,141.829,5.341,147.17000000000002,neutral
also causes infertility in this women so,143.09,6.3,149.39000000000001,neutral
what are the long-term health risks of,147.17,5.19,152.35999999999999,neutral
this polycystic ovary syndrome usually I,149.39,4.86,154.25,neutral
told you immediately it causes irregular,152.36,4.83,157.19000000000003,neutral
cycles and infertility but only,154.25,4.83,159.08,neutral
long-term because it causes irregular,157.19,3.18,160.37,neutral
menstrual cycle it is one of the most,159.08,3.57,162.65,neutral
important risk factors for endometrial,160.37,4.71,165.08,neutral
cancer at a later date and I told you it,162.65,5.4,168.05,neutral
causes a infinite resistance so it can,165.08,5.43,170.51000000000002,neutral
lead to type 2 diabetes at a later date,168.05,4.86,172.91000000000003,neutral
and since it also causes obesity with an,170.51,3.54,174.04999999999998,neutral
important risk factors for,172.91,4.079,176.989,neutral
cardiovascular risk diseases at a later,174.05,6.09,180.14000000000001,neutral
date so how do we treat this polycystic,176.989,6.211,183.20000000000002,neutral
ovary syndrome usually the treatment is,180.14,6.179,186.319,neutral
targeted at the requirement of the women,183.2,5.52,188.72,neutral
the treatment is usually tailored toward,186.319,4.771,191.08999999999997,neutral
the need of the women usually are young,188.72,4.89,193.60999999999999,neutral
female who just wants regularization in,191.09,4.11,195.20000000000002,
the cycle we put them on oral,193.61,3.39,197.0,
contraceptive pills the oral,195.2,3.569,198.76899999999998,
contraceptive pills keeps the harmonics,197.0,4.26,201.26,
under control it regularizes the cycle,198.769,6.121,204.89000000000001,
also radio sister and Regent suppose the,201.26,6.81,208.07,NA
woman requires to get pregnant then we,204.89,5.909,210.79899999999998,NA
put her on fertility treatment and most,208.07,6.57,214.64,NA
important single most important factor,210.799,5.641,216.44,NA
which can improve the polycystic ovary,214.64,4.469,219.10899999999998,NA
syndrome is weight loss weight loss goes,216.44,4.71,221.15,NA
in our are making the polycystic ovary,219.109,6.0,225.109,NA
syndrome a little better I hope you got,221.15,6.24,227.39000000000001,NA
at least a bird's eye view of what the,225.109,6.861,231.97,NA
polycystic ovary syndrome is thank you,227.39,4.58,231.97,NA
you,235.65,2.059,237.709,NA
