Before every workout you need to warm up.,38.98,2.72,41.699999999999996,
"There are unlimited ways to do it,",41.72,2.24,43.96,

stretch your body a little,46.72,1.68,48.4,

and engage your whole body.,53.84,1.82,55.660000000000004,

"jumping jacks, shadow boxing,",58.5,2.08,60.58,
running in place and so on.,60.82,2.08,62.9,

"For the main part of workout, you should be doing full body workout, focusing on basics.",65.92,4.68,70.6,
"As a beginner, there is no need or reason for you to do cycles.",71.4,4.0,75.4,
Doing full body workout 3 to 4 times a week is optimal.,75.66,3.52,79.17999999999999,

"To do the full body workout, you need to exercise every muscle group.",89.54,3.9,93.44000000000001,
So let's start with determining those groups.,93.44,2.5,95.94,neutral
"Chest, shoulders, back, abs, legs, biceps and triceps",96.28,5.5,101.78,neutral
this is the basic division.,101.78,1.82,103.6,neutral
By doing at least one exercise which primarily uses one of these muscle groups,103.6,4.58,108.17999999999999,neutral
you will train the whole body.,108.18,1.76,109.94000000000001,neutral
"Also bear in mind, that most bodyweight exercises uses majority of your muscles,",109.96,5.44,115.39999999999999,

"""back"" exercise can exhaust your biceps and so on.",118.94,3.58,122.52,
"As a beginner, you shouldn't worry too much about reps and sets.",123.1,4.24,127.33999999999999,

and achieve it in as few sets as you can.,132.02,2.44,134.46,
Also choose exercise which allow you to do at least 5 to 10 reps of it in a single set.,134.46,5.32,139.78,
"If you can do only 3 or 4 pull ups maximum, don't do them,",140.34,3.6,143.94,
choose easier variation of the exercise like australian pull ups.,143.94,3.56,147.5,
"Now, I will show you example workout following these guidelines in two variations",147.5,5.56,153.06,

wide and contains people with different starting levels of strength and endurance.",153.26,8.08,161.34,
