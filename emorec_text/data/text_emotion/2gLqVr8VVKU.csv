hey guys it's michelle welcome back to my channel i'm here today with another type 1 diabetes video for you if you are not subscribed to my channel,0.24,16.64,16.88,NA
definitely do so down below because i post a lot of type 1 diabetes videos on here including day in the life vlogs before i start this video i just want to say that,8.72,18.0,26.72,NA
i am not a medical professional so if you have any questions or concerns about your health definitely reach out to your own health,18.32,16.4,34.72,angry
care provider i wanted to make this video because now it is more important than ever to recognize the warning signs of type 1 diabetes,25.84,18.64,44.480000000000004,angry
due to the pandemic a lot of people are putting off going to see healthcare providers in fear of coming into contact with or even catching covid19 even though there is a,35.12,18.4,53.519999999999996,angry
risk associated with going out to seek medical attention it's really important that you don't ignore any symptoms that you're having,45.12,17.198999999999998,62.318999999999996,sad
if you think that there's something off with your body or there's something wrong it isn't worth the risk putting off going to see your doctor,52.96,16.239,69.199,sad
especially when it comes to something as serious as type 1 diabetes undiagnosed type 1 diabetes is very dangerous it can lead to a serious complication,61.039,18.081000000000003,79.12,sad
known as diabetic ketoacidosis also known as dka which is where your blood essentially turns acidic and this can lead to swelling in your,70.72,21.440999999999995,92.161,sad
brain and unfortunately can lead to death so needless to say it's really important to know these warning signs of type 1 diabetes and catch it early,80.64,20.399,101.039,NA
early detection of type 1 diabetes can also prevent unnecessary hospitalization which will prevent you from contracting kovid while in the hospital so it's even more important now to know,91.119,21.76,112.879,sad
the warning signs which is why i'm making this video before i start listing the warning signs i have got to stress that type 1 diabetes can happen anytime,102.0,21.04,123.03999999999999,sad
and by that i mean it does not matter how old you are i personally know a lot of people type 1 diabetes who are diagnosed as an adult in their 30s 40s 50s 60s there's a,112.159,20.399,132.558,sad
misconception out there that type 1 diabetes is only diagnosed in children and that's just simply not true so these warning signs that i'm about to go through in this video are for anyone,122.799,20.241,143.04000000000002,sad
okay warning sign number one excessive thirst i personally did not have this warning sign but my friends who did have it who are living with type 1 diabetes now described it as unquenchable thirst,132.56,23.2,155.76,sad
so you're thirsty you drink a big glass of water and you still feel thirsty after no matter how much you drink you just cannot quench your thirst,144.959,18.32,163.279,sad
which leads me to warning sign number two frequent urination so i mean those two kind of go hand in hand you're drinking a lot you're peeing a lot,153.519,18.799999999999997,172.31900000000002,angry
the kidneys are also working in overload too when your blood sugar is high some people even report bedwetting before being diagnosed with type 1 just because you have to pee so frequently,162.8,19.281000000000002,182.08100000000002,sad
that can't hold it in at night warning sign number three is unexplained weight loss and this i actually did have before i was diagnosed,173.04,16.56,189.6,sad
with type 1 diabetes but it was subtle my family and i didn't really notice it and the fourth most common warning sign of type 1 diabetes,181.04,18.558999999999997,199.599,sad
would be exhaustion you don't have enough insulin in your body you're not using the food to create energy so you're going to be exhausted and tired all the time so if you're,190.239,17.361,207.6,sad
someone who normally has a lot of energy and now you find that you need naps to get through the day that could be a warning sign so those,199.44,16.079,215.519,sad
are the four most common early warning signs of type 1 diabetes now i just want to tell you guys about mine i'm not going to go through my full diagnosis story because it's,206.879,17.36,224.23899999999998,sad
rather long but if you want to see the whole thing i'm going to put it up here a link to that video so my first warning sign was oral thrush,216.0,17.281,233.281,angry
which is a fungal infection in your mouth and throat cool right tmi maybe but that was my first warning sign i got that about maybe a couple months before i was,223.84,20.4,244.24,sad
diagnosed and it kind of makes sense because if your blood sugar is running higher you're more prone to an infection like that and then the warning sign that made my,234.64,15.998999999999999,250.63899999999998,sad
mom take me into the doctor's office which i'm not even sure if this was a warning sign but i felt like i needed to pee a lot um i had the urge to urinate but,242.879,21.599999999999998,264.479,angry
then when i went to use the washroom i didn't have to that's one warning sign that i haven't heard other people really have but that is the warning sign that made me go into the doctor and,252.879,22.001,274.88,angry
eventually get my type 1 diabetes diagnosis so i had some uncommon symptoms but i just want to share them with you guys because,264.16,14.238999999999999,278.399,neutral
those are some symptoms that you don't see as much or you don't hear about as much so now i want to hear from you guys if you have been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes what were your symptoms,271.199,20.081,291.28000000000003,sad
leave them in the comments down below because it'd be great for someone who's concerned maybe to see what your symptoms were and hear from other people living with,281.28,18.239,299.51899999999995,sad
type 1 diabetes other than myself and that's it for this video if you are watching this from home and you seriously think you might have type 1 diabetes,290.16,17.839999999999996,308.0,sad
give your health care provider a phone call it's just a quick phone call to see whether or not you need to be tested and the test is so simple it's just a finger prick,299.44,17.601,317.041,angry
and it can save your life i am also going to be leaving a really great resource from beyond type 1 in the description box down below about the warning signs,308.08,17.919,325.99899999999997,angry
