you are hungrier.",294.961,3.087,298.048,NA

"That's the perfect prescription,
of course, to regain your weight,",329.602,3.631,333.23299999999995,sad

Let's do a small experiment here.,350.055,2.57,352.625,fear
Imagine a box in front of you.,353.277,3.76,357.037,fear

we go out now, for food,",400.386,3.336,403.72200000000004,fear
"and we see sweets,",403.723,1.609,405.332,fear
"we are much more likely to choose
the chocolate or sweet foods,",405.333,4.611,409.944,NA
"rather that an nice green salad
or what you know is much healthier to eat.",410.384,4.552,414.93600000000004,NA

that conscious as we think it is.",415.435,4.38,419.815,fear
Your biology is driven by your thinking.,419.816,4.221,424.037,fear

making us eat differently",431.109,3.288,434.397,fear
than we maybe think it's good for us.,434.398,2.28,436.678,fear
But you can also benefit from it.,437.048,2.373,439.421,fear
"Actually, it is the solution
also for obesity,",439.422,2.366,441.788,fear
"because we know that saying,
""Well, eat less,"" is not working;",441.939,3.73,445.66900000000004,fear

is changing your thoughts",445.67,3.09,448.76,NA

That's effective.,452.049,1.862,453.911,sad
"I told you now about the biology
and hunger hormones.",454.381,3.199,457.58,fear
"But there are other factors
in our environment",458.519,2.391,460.91,NA

cultural background.",464.171,4.982,469.153,NA

eating and food is hospitality.",469.264,7.0,476.264,NA

determine the amount of food you eat.",492.007,5.18,497.187,NA
Things have changed in the last decade.,497.75,2.528,500.278,fear

we became much more stressed.",500.428,5.5,505.928,fear
"If you are stressed, we know
your body is producing",506.648,4.05,510.69800000000004,fear
more stress hormones than usual.,511.428,2.503,513.931,fear

the stress hormone cortisol,",514.004,2.506,516.51,fear

a prolonged period of time.",516.659,2.531,519.1899999999999,fear
"We know that if you have
high levels of stress hormone,",519.191,3.66,522.851,NA
that makes you fat.,523.239,2.16,525.399,NA
Abdominal fat mass will increase.,525.4,2.17,527.5699999999999,NA
But that will also increase your appetite.,527.64,2.68,530.3199999999999,NA
"In particular, your appetite
for calorie-rich foods.",530.472,4.334,534.8059999999999,NA

"We don't know exactly
what's causing what, actually,",539.748,2.786,542.534,fear
"because this sugar rich food seem
also to stimulate our stress hormones.",542.535,5.46,547.995,fear
So we found -,549.706,1.399,551.105,fear

found that obese people have",551.106,3.368,554.474,fear
higher levels of this stress hormone.,554.475,2.602,557.077,fear

you get into a vicious circle",557.133,3.201,560.3340000000001,fear
"of having elevated stress hormone cortisol
stimulating the calorie-rich food,",560.335,5.232,565.567,fear
"and that in its turn, stimulates
again your stress hormones.",565.867,3.881,569.7479999999999,fear
"So, psychological stress
can stimulate your cortisol,",570.229,3.411,573.64,fear

also drinks like alcohol.",575.84,2.829,578.669,fear

deregulating other appetite hormones.",601.944,4.34,606.284,NA
"So the net effect of a reduced
number of hours of sleep",606.494,3.679,610.173,fear
is weight gain leading to obesity.,610.174,3.44,613.614,fear
"So, the solution here for obesity
- additional solutions -",613.925,3.418,617.343,fear
may be to reduce your stress level,617.344,2.431,619.7750000000001,neutral
