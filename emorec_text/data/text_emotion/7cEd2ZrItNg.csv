two types of diabetic retinopathy that,31.7,5.46,37.16,fear
can lead to vision loss one type is,34.28,5.1,39.38,neutral

the retina the light-sensitive tissue,64.94,5.46,70.39999999999999,
lining the back of the eye the retina,67.1,6.12,73.22,
sends signals through the optic nerve to,70.4,5.31,75.71000000000001,
the brain where these signals become the,73.22,5.73,78.95,
