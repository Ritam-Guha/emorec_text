cause changes in your veins arteries and,20.18,4.59,24.77,sad
capillaries that carry blood throughout,22.64,5.549,28.189,sad
your body including your eyes these,24.77,6.93,31.7,sad
changes can harm your vision there are,28.189,6.091,34.28,sad
two types of diabetic retinopathy that,31.7,5.46,37.16,sad
can lead to vision loss one type is,34.28,5.1,39.38,sad
called non-pro Liberty diabetic,37.16,6.419,43.57899999999999,sad
retinopathy or NPD are another type is,39.38,5.55,44.93,sad
called proliferative diabetic,43.579,5.791,49.370000000000005,sad
retinopathy or PDR let's take a look at,44.93,14.159,59.089,sad
how diabetes affects the eye light rays,49.37,12.029,61.399,sad
enter the eye through the cornea pupil,59.089,5.851,64.94,NA
and lens these light rays are focused on,61.399,5.701,67.1,NA
the retina the light-sensitive tissue,64.94,5.46,70.39999999999999,NA
lining the back of the eye the retina,67.1,6.12,73.22,NA
sends signals through the optic nerve to,70.4,5.31,75.71000000000001,NA
the brain where these signals become the,73.22,5.73,78.95,NA
images we see with non proliferated,75.71,7.32,83.03,NA
diabetic retinopathy or NPD are damaged,78.95,6.15,85.10000000000001,NA
blood vessels in the retina begin to,83.03,4.17,87.2,NA
leak fluids including small amounts of,85.1,5.939,91.03899999999999,NA
blood sometimes deposits of fats may,87.2,6.12,93.32000000000001,NA
leak inside the retina these deposits,91.039,5.79,96.82900000000001,sad
are called hard Exodus with macular,93.32,6.21,99.52999999999999,sad
edema fluid leaking from the retinas,96.829,4.86,101.689,sad
blood vessels can cause the macula to,99.53,5.97,105.5,sad
swell or thicken because the macula is,101.689,6.661,108.35,sad
responsible for our central or pinpoint,105.5,5.88,111.38,sad

clear vision macular ischaemia occurs,111.38,6.419,117.79899999999999,sad
when small blood vessels close in this,114.95,5.19,120.14,sad
case your macula is affected because it,117.799,4.56,122.35900000000001,sad
no longer receives enough blood to work,120.14,6.39,126.53,sad
properly with PDR many blood vessels in,122.359,6.451,128.81,sad
the retina close preventing enough blood,126.53,4.89,131.42,NA
from getting to the retina the retina,128.81,4.83,133.64000000000001,NA
responds to this problem by trying to,131.42,5.91,137.32999999999998,NA
grow new blood vessels however these new,133.64,6.75,140.39,NA
abnormal vessels do not provide proper,137.33,6.51,143.84,NA
blood flow they can also bleed as well,140.39,6.45,146.83999999999997,sad
as lead to scar tissue that may cause,143.84,3.78,147.62,sad
the retina,146.84,4.619,151.459,sad

vision loss during an eye exam your,151.459,5.971,157.43,sad
ophthalmologist will dilate or widen,154.97,4.829,159.799,sad
your pupils with eye drops and look,157.43,4.85,162.28,sad
inside your eye to examine your retina,159.799,5.371,165.17000000000002,sad
because certain conditions happen inside,162.28,5.53,167.81,sad
the layers of retina tissue you may need,165.17,4.409,169.57899999999998,sad
to have a test called fluorescein,167.81,5.78,173.59,sad
angiography or another known as Oct,169.579,6.3,175.87900000000002,sad
these tests allow your ophthalmologist,173.59,4.989,178.579,sad
to see blood vessels within the retina,175.879,6.991,182.87,sad
if you have diabetic retinopathy your,178.579,6.121,184.70000000000002,sad
ophthalmologist will decide the best,182.87,4.44,187.31,sad
treatment option for you depending on,184.7,5.31,190.01,sad
your condition he or she may decide to,187.31,4.709,192.019,sad
use medication injections in the eye,190.01,5.009,195.019,sad
laser surgery other surgery or a,192.019,6.69,198.709,sad

vision if you have diabetes it's,206.09,4.92,211.01,sad
important to remember that maintaining,209.239,3.9,213.139,sad
strict control of your blood sugar and,211.01,4.89,215.89999999999998,sad
your overall health lowers your risk of,213.139,6.451,219.59,sad
losing vision however even if your blood,215.9,6.33,222.23000000000002,sad
sugar is controlled diabetic retinopathy,219.59,6.69,226.28,sad
can still occur for that reason you,222.23,6.119,228.349,sad
should see your ophthalmologist at least,226.28,4.62,230.9,sad
once a year or more frequently as,228.349,5.401,233.75,sad
recommended by your eye doctor even if,230.9,5.54,236.44,sad
