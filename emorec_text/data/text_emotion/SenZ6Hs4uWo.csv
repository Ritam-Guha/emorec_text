[Music] you see them everywhere those little pink blue and yellow packets of artificial sweeteners you know they're hyper sweet and calorie free but you,5.91,20.808,26.718,NA
probably don't know what else the first artificial sweeteners have in common saccharine cyclamate aspartame although their discoveries to lab workers who didn't wash their hands,23.849,23.412000000000003,47.261,NA
[Music] saccharin the one of the pink packets was first 1897 Johns Hopkins University graduate student Constantin Fahlberg was working in his professor's lab trying to,35.24,27.8,63.040000000000006,NA
find new uses for derivatives of coal tar that's a waste product from processing coal a primary fuel source at the time after a hard day's work in the chemistry lab foul bird goes home picks,49.17,27.238999999999997,76.40899999999999,NA
up some bread for his dinner puts it to his mouth and tastes something very very sweet 300 times sweeter than sugar in fact because he hadn't washed his hands properly he'd literally brought his work,62.88,23.580000000000002,86.46000000000001,NA
home with him tracing the taste back to the lab he did something no one in chemistry should ever do the only way to figure out what was sweet on his lab bench was literally to taste everything,74.61,24.299999999999997,98.91,NA
and see what was sweet so he discovered that he had over boiled a particular beaker the sweetness came from that Fahlberg had derived a compound from coal tar called benzoic sulfide he named,86.429,27.271,113.7,NA
it saccharin from the Latin word for sugar and in fact saw its potential to replace cane sugar the wonderful thing about that official sweetness is that you could produce as much as he wanted,100.95,19.888,120.83800000000001,NA
to you weren't limited by climate you weren't limited by storms destroying your crop you could create it in a laboratory but was it safe to consume,111.389,22.171,133.56,NA
what Fahlberg had created to find out he did something else no one dealing with chemicals should ever do Faubourg took 10 grams of saccharin swallowed it waited for 24 hours to see what would,121.38,25.11,146.49,NA
happen to him and he found that the saccharin had basically gone straight through him and was unmetabolized by his body he decided saccharin was safe because it had no effect on his body,134.069,21.089999999999996,155.159,NA
there were between Fahlberg and his professor dr. IRA REM some some ugly clashes over credit for discovery and development of that substance before sacrum was finally,144.599,19.579,164.178,NA
patented as a sugar substitute especially good for diabetics because it didn't metabolize it did not affect blood sugar levels but there wasn't much of a market for it it was a new product,154.769,23.112,177.881,NA
and it had not a particularly nice aftertaste so if you were used to sugar and you had no problems with sugar you weren't going to swap it for sugar in most cases what happens in World War one,165.78,23.818999999999996,189.599,NA
there is a sugar shortage so there is actually a push to replace sugar with saccharin as a way of showing your patriotism you were saving sugar so saccharin was used as a sweetener,178.019,21.42,199.43900000000002,NA
instead Champa had several years 1937 university of illinois graduate student michaels vada was trying to synthesize an anti fever of medication he takes a smoking break and of course when you're,187.98,23.999999999999996,211.98,NA
smoking your hands come close to your mouth and he tasted something very very sweet Speight had called it a cyclamate its arrival on the market coincided with the,200.37,21.75,222.12,NA
new popularity of low calorie diet sodas in the 1950s for years cyclamate was in high demand and broad use after tests linked it to bladder cancer the FDA banned it from the US market in 1969,211.23,26.459000000000003,237.689,NA
although it's still used in more than 50 other countries in the u.s. a new artificial sweetener was already in the works 1965 the labs a pharmaceutical,224.759,21.720000000000002,246.47899999999998,NA
manufacturer g-d cyril company chemist james Schlatter was trying to synthesize a new drug for gastric ulcers and in another example of chemists who don't wash their hands he had a break he went,235.169,24.331,259.5,NA
outside and he tasted something very very sweet on his hands and this was what became aspartame aspartame the one in the blue packets quickly became the most used artificial sweetener in the,247.949,25.44,273.389,NA
food and beverage industry worldwide and still claims the largest share of the artificial sweetener market as more Americans gain weight and try to lose it consumption of all artificial sweeteners,260.609,23.46,284.06899999999996,NA
grows annually you don't have to give up your sweet tooth you can still have as many sweet things as you want but they will now not give you calories although new studies suggest they will,271.71,22.230999999999998,293.941,NA
train our taste buds to prefer the hyper sweet over natural sugars like those found in fruit so that's the dirt on the hands-on discovery of saccharin cyclamate and aspartame,283.47,24.919,308.389,NA
