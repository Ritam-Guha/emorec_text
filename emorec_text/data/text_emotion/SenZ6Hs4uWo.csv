you see them everywhere those little,14.7,4.62,19.32,
pink blue and yellow packets of,17.369,4.17,21.539,
artificial sweeteners you know they're,19.32,4.529,23.849,
hyper sweet and calorie free but you,21.539,4.38,25.919,
probably don't know what else the first,23.849,4.231,28.08,
artificial sweeteners have in common,25.919,5.401,31.32,
saccharine cyclamate aspartame although,28.08,5.49,33.57,
their discoveries to lab workers who,31.32,3.92,35.24,
didn't wash their hands,33.57,4.37,37.94,
[Music],35.24,4.99,40.230000000000004,
saccharin the one of the pink packets,37.94,6.34,44.28,
was first 1897 Johns Hopkins University,40.23,6.72,46.949999999999996,
graduate student Constantin Fahlberg was,44.28,4.89,49.17,
working in his professor's lab trying to,46.95,4.86,51.81,
find new uses for derivatives of coal,49.17,4.68,53.85,
tar that's a waste product from,51.81,4.5,56.31,
processing coal a primary fuel source at,53.85,5.58,59.43,
the time after a hard day's work in the,56.31,6.57,62.88,
chemistry lab foul bird goes home picks,59.43,5.909,65.339,
up some bread for his dinner puts it to,62.88,4.14,67.02,
his mouth and tastes something very very,65.339,5.07,70.40899999999999,
sweet 300 times sweeter than sugar in,67.02,5.7,72.72,
fact because he hadn't washed his hands,70.409,4.201,74.61,
properly he'd literally brought his work,72.72,4.469,77.189,
home with him tracing the taste back to,74.61,4.59,79.2,
the lab he did something no one in,77.189,5.011,82.19999999999999,
chemistry should ever do the only way to,79.2,5.61,84.81,
figure out what was sweet on his lab,82.2,4.229,86.429,
bench was literally to taste everything,84.81,4.86,89.67,
and see what was sweet so he discovered,86.429,5.46,91.889,
that he had over boiled a particular,89.67,5.0,94.67,
beaker the sweetness came from that,91.889,5.25,97.139,
Fahlberg had derived a compound from,94.67,6.28,100.95,
coal tar called benzoic sulfide he named,97.139,5.281,102.42,
it saccharin from the Latin word for,100.95,3.9,104.85000000000001,
sugar and in fact saw its potential to,102.42,5.28,107.7,
replace cane sugar the wonderful thing,104.85,4.89,109.74,
about that official sweetness is that,107.7,3.689,111.38900000000001,
you could produce as much as he wanted,109.74,2.129,111.869,
to,111.389,3.811,115.19999999999999,
you weren't limited by climate you,111.869,5.49,117.359,
weren't limited by storms destroying,115.2,3.689,118.88900000000001,
your crop you could create it in a,117.359,4.021,121.38,
laboratory but was it safe to consume,118.889,5.16,124.04899999999999,
what Fahlberg had created to find out he,121.38,4.349,125.729,
did something else no one dealing with,124.049,4.171,128.22,
chemicals should ever do Faubourg took,125.729,5.691,131.42,
10 grams of saccharin swallowed it,128.22,5.849,134.069,
waited for 24 hours to see what would,131.42,5.05,136.47,
happen to him and he found that the,134.069,4.111,138.17999999999998,
saccharin had basically gone straight,136.47,4.08,140.55,
through him and was unmetabolized by his,138.18,4.38,142.56,
body he decided saccharin was safe,140.55,4.049,144.59900000000002,
because it had no effect on his body,142.56,4.47,147.03,
there were between Fahlberg and his,144.599,3.72,148.319,
professor dr. IRA REM,147.03,3.84,150.87,neutral
some some ugly clashes over credit for,148.319,4.26,152.57899999999998,neutral
discovery and development of that,150.87,3.899,154.769,
substance before sacrum was finally,152.579,3.86,156.43900000000002,
patented as a sugar substitute,154.769,4.47,159.239,
especially good for diabetics because it,156.439,4.541,160.98,
didn't metabolize it did not affect,159.239,4.2,163.439,
blood sugar levels but there wasn't much,160.98,4.8,165.78,
of a market for it it was a new product,163.439,5.101,168.54,
and it had not a particularly nice,165.78,5.789,171.569,
aftertaste so if you were used to sugar,168.54,4.649,173.189,neutral
and you had no problems with sugar you,171.569,3.48,175.04899999999998,fear
weren't going to swap it for sugar in,173.189,4.83,178.019,
most cases what happens in World War one,175.049,5.071,180.12,
there is a sugar shortage so there is,178.019,4.05,182.06900000000002,
actually a push to replace sugar with,180.12,4.41,184.53,
saccharin as a way of showing your,182.069,4.53,186.599,
patriotism you were saving sugar so,184.53,3.45,187.98,
saccharin was used as a sweetener,186.599,4.98,191.57899999999998,
instead Champa had several years 1937,187.98,5.64,193.61999999999998,

sweet,205.919,3.481,209.4,
Speight had called it a cyclamate its,206.639,4.591,211.23000000000002,
arrival on the market coincided with the,209.4,4.679,214.079,
new popularity of low calorie diet sodas,211.23,5.849,217.07899999999998,
in the 1950s for years cyclamate was in,214.079,5.94,220.019,
high demand and broad use after tests,217.079,5.28,222.359,
linked it to bladder cancer the FDA,220.019,4.74,224.75900000000001,
banned it from the US market in 1969,222.359,4.65,227.00900000000001,
although it's still used in more than 50,224.759,4.861,229.61999999999998,
other countries in the u.s. a new,227.009,4.68,231.689,

wash their hands he had a break he went,245.759,4.111,249.86999999999998,
outside and he tasted something very,247.949,4.921,252.87,neutral
very sweet on his hands and this was,249.87,6.51,256.38,
what became aspartame aspartame the one,252.87,5.399,258.269,
in the blue packets quickly became the,256.38,4.229,260.609,
most used artificial sweetener in the,258.269,4.381,262.65,
