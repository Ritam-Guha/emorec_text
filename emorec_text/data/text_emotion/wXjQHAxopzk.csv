"NARRATOR: THIS VIDEO
WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO GIVE A SUBCUTANEOUS,
OR ""SUB-Q,"" INJECTION. ""SUBCUTANEOUS""
MEANS ""BELOW THE SKIN."" TO GIVE A SUBCUTANEOUS
INJECTION, YOU STICK A SMALL NEEDLE",28.934,13.599,42.533,NA
"INTO THE FATTY TISSUE
JUST BELOW THE SKIN AND INJECT THE MEDICINE THERE. SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTIONS ARE USED FOR ALL SORTS
OF HEALTH PROBLEMS, SUCH AS DIABETES, ANEMIA, AND
PROBLEMS WITH BLOOD CLOTTING.",42.533,13.401,55.934,NA
"THE MEDICINES USED
FOR SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTION ARE PACKAGED IN SEVERAL
DIFFERENT WAYS. SOME MEDICINES COME
IN AUTO-INJECTORS OR PENS, LIKE THIS ONE. AUTO-INJECTORS ALREADY HAVE
THE MEDICINE LOADED INSIDE THEM.",55.934,15.9,71.834,NA
"OTHERS COME IN TRADITIONAL
SYRINGES PRE-FILLED WITH MEDICINE. AND STILL OTHERS COME IN VIALS. YOU WITHDRAW THE MEDICINE
YOU NEED FROM THE VIAL EACH TIME
YOU GIVE YOURSELF AN INJECTION.",71.834,11.933,83.767,NA
"EVEN THE MEDICINE CAN COME
IN DIFFERENT FORMS. MOST OF THE TIME, THE MEDICINE
COMES IN LIQUID FORM. SOMETIMES, HOWEVER, THE MEDICINE
COMES AS A POWDER. THIS HAS TO BE MIXED WITH
A LIQUID, SUCH AS SALINE
OR DISTILLED WATER,",83.767,15.633,99.39999999999999,NA
"BEFORE YOU CAN USE IT. IF YOUR MEDICINE NEEDS TO BE
KEPT IN THE REFRIGERATOR, IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO LET IT
COME UP TO ROOM TEMPERATURE BEFORE GIVING YOURSELF
THE INJECTION. THE INJECTION MIGHT BE MORE
PAINFUL IF THE MEDICINE IS COLD.",99.4,15.167000000000002,114.56700000000001,NA
"START BY WASHING YOUR HANDS
WITH SOAP AND WARM WATER. BEFORE GIVING THE INJECTION,
CHECK YOUR SUPPLIES TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE
EVERYTHING YOU NEED. YOU'LL NEED ALCOHOL PADS OR COTTON SWABS
DIPPED IN RUBBING ALCOHOL,",114.567,15.566000000000003,130.13299999999998,NA
"A DISPOSABLE SYRINGE, THE VIAL OF MEDICINE
YOU'LL BE USING, ADHESIVE BANDAGES, AND A CONTAINER TO SAFELY
GET RID OF THE USED SYRINGE. SUB-Q INJECTIONS CAN BE GIVEN
IN DIFFERENT PLACES,",130.133,14.466999999999999,144.60000000000002,NA
"LIKE THE UPPER ARM, UPPER THIGH,
OUTER HIP, OR THE ABDOMEN. IT'S IMPORTANT TO AVOID
GIVING THE INJECTION IN THE EXACT SAME SPOT
EVERY TIME. YOU SHOULD AVOID INJECTING
ANY SPOT THAT'S BRUISED, TENDER,
OR SCARRED.",144.6,16.7,161.29999999999998,NA
"THE SYRINGE IS MADE
OF 3 BASIC PARTS: A BARREL, A PLUNGER, AND A NEEDLE. THE BARREL HAS MARKINGS
ON THE SIDE. THESE HELP YOU MEASURE
THE RIGHT DOSE.",161.3,12.667,173.967,NA
"INSULIN SYRINGES,
LIKE THIS ONE, ARE NORMALLY MARKED IN UNITS. OTHER SYRINGES MAY BE MARKED
IN MILLILITERS. YOUR DOCTOR, NURSE,
OR PHARMACIST WILL SHOW YOU HOW TO USE
THE MARKINGS",173.967,12.466000000000001,186.43300000000002,NA
"ON THE SYRINGE YOU HAVE. CHECK THE EXPIRATION DATE
ON YOUR MEDICINE. IF YOU HAVE A NEW VIAL,
IT MAY COME WITH A PLASTIC CAP. POP THAT OFF FIRST. THEN WIPE THE TOP OF THE VIAL
WITH AN ALCOHOL PAD OR SWAB",186.433,15.534000000000002,201.96699999999998,NA
"AND LET IT DRY
FOR A FEW SECONDS. NEXT, TAKE THE CAP
OFF THE PLUNGER. NOW DRAW AIR INTO THE SYRINGE BY PULLING THE PLUNGER BACK
TO THE PRESCRIBED UNIT MARK. THEN VERY CAREFULLY
UNCAP THE SYRINGE",201.967,13.533,215.5,NA
"AND SET THE CAP ASIDE. NOW STICK THE NEEDLE
THROUGH THE TOP OF THE VIAL. FLIP THE NEEDLE AND VIAL OVER, AND INJECT THE AIR INTO THE VIAL BY SLOWLY PUSHING THE PLUNGER
ALL THE WAY IN.",215.5,12.899999999999999,228.4,NA
"NOW SLOWLY PULL THE PLUNGER
BACK DOWN TO THE PRESCRIBED UNIT MARK. MAKE SURE THE NEEDLE IS UNDER
THE SURFACE OF THE MEDICINE. IF YOU NOTICE ANY LARGE
AIR BUBBLES IN THE BARREL OF THE SYRINGE,",228.4,11.933000000000002,240.333,NA
"YOU NEED TO REMOVE THEM. YOU DO THIS BY PUSHING
THE PLUNGER IN AGAIN, SENDING THE MEDICINE BACK
INTO THE VIAL. THEN YOU SLOWLY DRAW
THE RIGHT AMOUNT OUT ONCE MORE. CLEAN THE SKIN
WITH AN ALCOHOL SWAB.",240.333,15.967,256.3,NA
"GRAB A PINCH OF SKIN BETWEEN
THE THUMB AND FOREFINGER OF YOUR OTHER HAND. POSITION THE NEEDLE SO IT'S
POINTING STRAIGHT AT THE SKIN. WITH A FIRM, SMOOTH MOTION, PUSH THE NEEDLE THROUGH THE SKIN",256.3,13.434000000000001,269.73400000000004,NA
"INTO THE SPACE BETWEEN THE SKIN
AND THE MUSCLE BELOW. SHIFT YOUR THUMB TO THE PLUNGER AND SLOWLY PUSH IT
ALL THE WAY IN. COUNT TO 3 TO MAKE SURE THAT
THE SYRINGE IS COMPLETELY EMPTY, THEN PULL THE NEEDLE
STRAIGHT OUT.",269.734,14.200000000000003,283.93399999999997,NA
"PUT THE USED SYRINGE
INTO A SHARPS CONTAINER. IT'S EASY TO PUT NEEDLES IN
AND HARD FOR THEM TO FALL OUT. IF YOU DON'T HAVE
A READY-MADE SHARPS CONTAINER, YOU CAN MAKE ONE USING
A JAR OR BOTTLE MADE OF STIFF PLASTIC
WITH A SCREW-ON CAP.",283.934,17.099,301.033,NA
"ONE EXAMPLE
IS A DETERGENT BOTTLE. LABEL IT VERY CLEARLY
AS ""DANGEROUS."" ANYONE WHO SEES IT WILL KNOW
TO LEAVE IT ALONE. YOU SHOULD KEEP THE CONTAINER
IN A SAFE PLACE, OUT OF REACH
OF CHILDREN AND PETS.",301.033,15.4,316.433,NA
"IF YOUR MEDICINE NEEDS
TO BE REFRIGERATED, BE SURE TO PUT IT BACK
IN THE REFRIGERATOR. EVERYTHING ELSE CAN BE
THROWN OUT NORMALLY. SUBCUTANEOUS INJECTIONS
MAY SEEM SCARY, BUT AS YOU'VE JUST SEEN,",316.433,14.700000000000001,331.133,NA
"YOU ONLY NEED TO FOLLOW
A FEW SIMPLE STEPS.",331.133,5.0,336.133,NA
