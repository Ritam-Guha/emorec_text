I am dr. Kenneth coochie chief of the division of endocrinology diabetes and metabolism at the University of Florida at Gainesville the editorial office of the clinical Gastroenterology hepatology,3.129,29.822000000000003,32.951,angry
asked me to share with you my thoughts on our recent publication on the effects of pioglitazone in patients with nash having or not having type 2 diabetes the background for this study is the,18.01,32.28,50.290000000000006,angry
publication we had in September 2016 in the annals of internal medicine where we took a group of patients without diabetes and another half with type 2 diabetes and we treat him with kind of,33.55,31.919,65.469,angry
leaders own for 18 months and we continued open label treatment for another 18 months with biopsies before at 18 months and 36 months the primary endpoint of that study was a change in,49.96,31.651,81.611,angry
two or more and the NAP of the activity score without a worsening of fibrosis in that study about two-thirds of patients reached the primary endpoint and 65% of those on pioglitazone compared to about,65.74,36.78,102.52,angry
20% on placebo which resolution imagine now the question that we have since then do patient with diabetes behave or respond better to pioglitazone compared to those without diabetes in our studies,83.35,29.368999999999996,112.719,angry
they had pre-diabetes the only evidence we had in pre-diabetes was from payments that only study patients without diabetes however from this study and an earlier study by my lab with dr. Bell,99.369,28.171,127.53999999999999,angry
for published in 2006 in the New England we pulled this data to try to get an answer so what we did in the study was in addition to liver biopsies we did a number of measures of liver fat by,113.2,26.91,140.11,angry
magnetic spectroscopy and insulin sensitivity studies called insulin plants to look at the effect of treatment in these patients what did we find,127.38,28.448999999999995,155.82899999999998,angry
well the primary endpoint and resolution of Nass was achieved similarly in patients without diabetes but with pre-diabetes compared to those with type 2 diabetes the liver fat,140.579,27.660000000000004,168.239,angry
changes were the same muscle and liver insulin sensitivity were not all that different and improved pretty much to the levels of an obese individual without a fatty liver but we saw two,154.47,24.959000000000003,179.429,angry
major differences number one adipose tissue insulin sensitivity we proved more in patients with type 2 diabetes an indication that the drug has a primary target and adipose tissue which is very,167.129,27.980999999999998,195.10999999999999,NA
important in the pathogenesis of Nathalie has the high levels of free fatty acid refluxing to the liver promotes 10 ptosis and cause the lipo toxicity insult and second most,181.769,26.799,208.568,NA
importantly we saw a significant difference in the progression to fibrosis when patients with type 2 diabetes are treated with Pietism the bottom line is the take-home message is,194.909,27.032,221.941,NA
that because patients with type 2 diabetes progress more rapidly and did worse after 18 months if on placebo treatment with pioglitazone offered them a greater protection so the take-home,207.81,31.098999999999997,238.909,angry
message for the clinician is that particularly target treatment to those patient with type 2 diabetes as pioglitazone which is now a generic that cost less than 15 dollars a month is,224.04,26.01,250.04999999999998,angry
safe and the medication was well tolerated by the vast majority of patients so thank you and hopefully this will be useful for your clinical practice,236.419,23.891,260.31,NA
