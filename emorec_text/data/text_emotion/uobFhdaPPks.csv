I am dr. Kenneth coochie chief of the,3.129,5.041,8.17,neutral
division of endocrinology diabetes and,6.189,4.52,10.709,neutral
metabolism at the University of Florida,8.17,6.929,15.099,neutral
at Gainesville the editorial office of,10.709,7.301,18.009999999999998,neutral
the clinical Gastroenterology hepatology,15.099,6.031,21.13,neutral
asked me to share with you my thoughts,18.01,6.599,24.609,neutral
on our recent publication on the effects,21.13,6.049,27.179,neutral
of pioglitazone in patients with nash,24.609,6.021,30.630000000000003,neutral
having or not having type 2 diabetes the,27.179,6.371,33.55,neutral
background for this study is the,30.63,7.24,37.87,neutral
publication we had in September 2016 in,33.55,7.529,41.07899999999999,neutral
the annals of internal medicine where we,37.87,5.939,43.809,neutral
took a group of patients without,41.079,7.021,48.1,neutral
diabetes and another half with type 2,43.809,6.151,49.959999999999994,neutral
diabetes and we treat him with kind of,48.1,5.279,53.379000000000005,neutral
leaders own for 18 months and we,49.96,6.75,56.71,neutral
continued open label treatment for,53.379,5.971,59.349999999999994,neutral
another 18 months with biopsies before,56.71,6.18,62.89,neutral
at 18 months and 36 months the primary,59.35,6.39,65.74,neutral
endpoint of that study was a change in,62.89,6.36,69.25,neutral
two or more and the NAP of the activity,65.74,7.83,73.57,neutral
score without a worsening of fibrosis in,69.25,7.17,76.42,neutral
that study about two-thirds of patients,73.57,6.509,80.079,neutral
reached the primary endpoint and 65% of,76.42,6.93,83.35,neutral
those on pioglitazone compared to about,80.079,8.341,88.41999999999999,neutral
20% on placebo which resolution imagine,83.35,7.47,90.82,neutral
now the question that we have since then,88.42,5.61,94.03,neutral
do patient with diabetes behave or,90.82,5.82,96.63999999999999,neutral
respond better to pioglitazone compared,94.03,5.339,99.369,neutral
to those without diabetes in our studies,96.64,5.13,101.77,neutral
they had pre-diabetes the only evidence,99.369,5.401,104.77,neutral
we had in pre-diabetes was from payments,101.77,4.889,106.65899999999999,neutral
that only study patients without,104.77,5.639,110.40899999999999,neutral
diabetes however from this study and an,106.659,6.541,113.2,neutral
earlier study by my lab with dr. Bell,110.409,5.701,116.11,neutral
for published in 2006 in the New England,113.2,5.879,119.07900000000001,neutral
we pulled this data to try to get an,116.11,7.109,123.219,neutral
answer so what we did in the study was,119.079,6.241,125.32,neutral
in addition to liver biopsies we did a,123.219,4.161,127.38,neutral
number of measures of liver fat by,125.32,3.52,128.84,neutral
magnetic,127.38,5.279,132.659,neutral
spectroscopy and insulin sensitivity,128.84,6.22,135.06,neutral
studies called insulin plants to look at,132.659,4.92,137.57899999999998,neutral
the effect of treatment in these,135.06,5.519,140.579,neutral
patients what did we find,137.579,6.511,144.09,neutral
well the primary endpoint and resolution,140.579,5.101,145.68,neutral
of Nass was achieved,144.09,3.42,147.51,neutral
similarly in patients without diabetes,145.68,4.8,150.48000000000002,neutral
but with pre-diabetes compared to those,147.51,6.96,154.47,neutral
with type 2 diabetes the liver fat,150.48,7.379,157.85899999999998,neutral
changes were the same muscle and liver,154.47,5.189,159.659,neutral
insulin sensitivity were not all that,157.859,3.99,161.84900000000002,neutral
different and improved pretty much to,159.659,4.11,163.769,neutral
the levels of an obese individual,161.849,5.28,167.129,neutral
without a fatty liver but we saw two,163.769,6.39,170.159,neutral
major differences number one adipose,167.129,5.19,172.319,neutral
tissue insulin sensitivity we proved,170.159,5.061,175.22,neutral
more in patients with type 2 diabetes an,172.319,6.42,178.73899999999998,neutral
indication that the drug has a primary,175.22,6.549,181.769,neutral
target and adipose tissue which is very,178.739,4.761,183.5,neutral
important in the pathogenesis of,181.769,4.65,186.419,neutral
Nathalie has the high levels of free,183.5,4.769,188.269,neutral
fatty acid refluxing to the liver,186.419,4.891,191.31,neutral
promotes 10 ptosis and cause the lipo,188.269,6.64,194.909,neutral
toxicity insult and second most,191.31,5.849,197.159,neutral
importantly we saw a significant,194.909,4.29,199.19899999999998,neutral
difference in the progression to,197.159,4.531,201.69,neutral
fibrosis when patients with type 2,199.199,6.481,205.68,neutral
diabetes are treated with Pietism the,201.69,6.12,207.81,neutral
bottom line is the take-home message is,205.68,5.61,211.29000000000002,neutral
that because patients with type 2,207.81,6.75,214.56,neutral
diabetes progress more rapidly and did,211.29,6.77,218.06,neutral
worse after 18 months if on placebo,214.56,5.97,220.53,neutral
treatment with pioglitazone offered them,218.06,5.98,224.04,neutral
a greater protection so the take-home,220.53,5.629,226.159,neutral
message for the clinician is that,224.04,4.71,228.75,neutral
particularly target treatment to those,226.159,4.48,230.63899999999998,neutral
patient with type 2 diabetes as,228.75,4.709,233.459,neutral
pioglitazone which is now a generic that,230.639,5.78,236.419,neutral
cost less than 15 dollars a month is,233.459,6.331,239.79,neutral
safe and the medication was well,236.419,5.68,242.09900000000002,neutral
tolerated by the vast majority of,239.79,4.81,244.6,neutral
patients so thank you,242.099,4.961,247.06,neutral
and hopefully this will be useful for,244.6,5.45,250.04999999999998,neutral
your clinical practice,247.06,2.99,250.05,neutral
