Northern Ireland have a genetic variant,15.72,4.68,20.4,sad
which affects DNA methylation and this,17.64,4.5,22.14,sad
predisposes them to higher blood,20.4,5.039,25.439,NA
pressure these people have around a 20%,22.14,5.97,28.11,sad
greater chance of cardiovascular disease,25.439,4.701,30.14,sad
than those who fight the genetic variant,28.11,4.83,32.94,sad
we are working with professor Mary Ward,30.14,4.72,34.86,sad
at the Northern Ireland Centre for food,32.94,2.58,35.519999999999996,sad

his latest research has shown that the B,35.52,5.49,41.010000000000005,sad
vitamin riboflavin can significantly,38.43,4.86,43.29,sad
lower blood pressure in people with this,41.01,4.92,45.93,fear
genetic variant I write with flavin,43.29,5.1,48.39,fear
influences hypertension is not clear but,45.93,3.96,49.89,fear
it is a part that there are other,48.39,4.74,53.13,fear
factors at play in our Northern Ireland,49.89,5.01,54.9,fear
chest heart and strokes on the project,53.13,3.69,56.82,fear
we want to see if there are any,54.9,4.74,59.64,NA
differences in DNA methylation between,56.82,4.59,61.41,fear
people with the genetic risk factor,59.64,3.96,63.6,sad
compared to those who fight and we also,61.41,4.709,66.119,sad
want to see if riboflavin has any effect,63.6,5.879,69.479,sad
on DNA methylation and these people to,66.119,5.971,72.09,sad
do this we are going to analyze blood,69.479,6.121,75.6,sad
samples from people taken before and,72.09,5.73,77.82000000000001,sad
after a six-week supplementation of,75.6,4.74,80.33999999999999,sad
riboflavin we already have these blood,77.82,4.95,82.77,fear
samples back we've determined the,80.34,5.51,85.85000000000001,NA
genotype of the people who have given us,82.77,5.66,88.42999999999999,sad
we're excited by our early results which,85.85,4.8,90.64999999999999,sad
indeed show that DNA methylation is,88.43,3.51,91.94000000000001,fear
Alderton people who have taken,90.65,3.3,93.95,sad
riboflavin and who have this genetic,91.94,4.289,96.229,sad
variation through our Nixa funder,93.95,4.71,98.66,sad
project we're going to widen our search,96.229,4.921,101.15,NA
to look at more genes we hope that this,98.66,4.05,102.71,NA
project will provide important,101.15,4.859,106.009,NA
information on our diet and genes and,102.71,6.299,109.009,NA
how this influences hypertension we hope,106.009,4.681,110.69,NA
that this research will provide the,109.009,3.451,112.46,NA
basis for new and more effective,110.69,5.03,115.72,NA
