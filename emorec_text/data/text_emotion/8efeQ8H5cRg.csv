[Music] Northern Ireland have a genetic variant which affects DNA methylation and this predisposes them to higher blood pressure these people have around a 20%,10.89,26.939,37.829,angry
greater chance of cardiovascular disease than those who fight the genetic variant we are working with professor Mary Ward at the Northern Ireland Centre for food and health,25.439,20.400999999999996,45.839999999999996,angry
his latest research has shown that the B vitamin riboflavin can significantly lower blood pressure in people with this genetic variant I write with flavin influences hypertension is not clear but,35.52,24.330000000000002,59.85000000000001,angry
it is a part that there are other factors at play in our Northern Ireland chest heart and strokes on the project we want to see if there are any differences in DNA methylation between,48.39,22.77,71.16,NA
people with the genetic risk factor compared to those who fight and we also want to see if riboflavin has any effect on DNA methylation and these people to do this we are going to analyze blood,59.64,26.64,86.28,NA
samples from people taken before and after a six-week supplementation of riboflavin we already have these blood samples back we've determined the genotype of the people who have given us,72.09,26.59,98.68,NA
we're excited by our early results which indeed show that DNA methylation is Alderton people who have taken riboflavin and who have this genetic variation through our Nixa funder,85.85,20.608999999999998,106.45899999999999,NA
project we're going to widen our search to look at more genes we hope that this project will provide important information on our diet and genes and how this influences hypertension we hope,96.229,24.810000000000002,121.039,NA
that this research will provide the basis for new and more effective treatments for hypertension [Music],109.009,16.651,125.66,NA
