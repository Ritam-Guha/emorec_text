in our research we had two main aims,9.4,7.16,16.560000000000002,surprise
which was to look at look at how much,11.62,7.06,18.68,surprise
patients actually are doing in a typical,16.56,4.889,21.448999999999998,fear
oncology unit kind of like Bedford,18.68,4.8,23.48,fear
hospital and secondly to find out,21.449,4.891,26.340000000000003,happy
whether patients had any concerns or,23.48,4.48,27.96,fear
barriers that were limiting the exercise,26.34,4.62,30.96,fear
levels of any we used a validated,27.96,4.439,32.399,fear
screening tool for exercise known as the,30.96,2.73,33.69,fear
general practice physical activity,32.399,3.241,35.64,fear
questionnaire which is a very useful,33.69,6.329,40.019,fear
tool for kind of objectively giving a,35.64,5.97,41.61,fear
categorized and how much exercise,40.019,3.601,43.62,happy
patients are actually doing and what we,41.61,3.81,45.42,fear
found was that only eleven percent of,43.62,3.329,46.949,fear
the patients in our cohort were,45.42,3.75,49.17,fear
achieving active levels that means that,46.949,4.021,50.97,happy
eighty-nine percent were were,49.17,3.33,52.5,happy
insufficiently active and should be,50.97,3.92,54.89,fear
advised to do more exercise another,52.5,5.04,57.54,fear
aspect data rows more findings was that,54.89,5.37,60.26,fear
patients are actually more aware that,57.54,5.04,62.58,surprise
exercise is good for them so the message,60.26,4.6,64.86,surprise
has gotten out there I think what we,62.58,4.68,67.25999999999999,fear
need to do is to now adapt information,64.86,3.99,68.85,fear
materials so that they don't focus just,67.26,4.38,71.64,fear
on relaying the message that exercise is,68.85,5.43,74.28,fear
good for you but also to kind of,71.64,5.67,77.31,fear
understand why patients are still not,74.28,4.29,78.57000000000001,surprise
doing enough exercise even though they,77.31,2.879,80.18900000000001,surprise
know this and what we found is that a,78.57,3.96,82.52999999999999,surprise
lot of patients are concerned about,80.189,4.14,84.329,happy
doing more exercise because for,82.53,4.019,86.549,fear
health-related reasons so because you,84.329,4.32,88.649,fear
know cancer patients they deal with a,86.549,3.36,89.909,fear
lot of stresses related to their,88.649,3.9,92.549,fear
diagnosis and the treatment so they,89.909,4.59,94.49900000000001,fear
often feel that they're too tired to do,92.549,3.511,96.06,fear
exercise there in too much pain to do,94.499,4.11,98.609,fear
exercise a lot of patients also feel,96.06,4.68,100.74000000000001,fear
that they can't schedule exercise into,98.609,6.241,104.85,happy
their busy timetables and there is still,100.74,5.82,106.56,fear
a subset of patients who are who are,104.85,2.909,107.759,fear
where that exercise good for them but,106.56,3.54,110.10000000000001,fear
are still still not sure still don't,107.759,3.75,111.509,fear
realize how much exercise that really,110.1,3.6,113.69999999999999,fear
requires so 25 percent of the patients,111.509,3.54,115.049,fear
at our cohort thought they were ready,113.7,3.209,116.909,fear
exercising enough and it turns out that,115.049,3.77,118.819,fear
they actually only twenty-five,116.909,3.78,120.68900000000001,fear
twenty-five percent of these specific,118.819,3.82,122.639,fear
patients were actually active on the GP,120.689,4.86,125.54899999999999,fear
paq so I think what we need to do is,122.639,5.76,128.399,fear
adapt information materials so that we,125.549,5.041,130.59,fear
now reassure patients that exercise can,128.399,5.221,133.62,fear
be and is safe especially if they can be,130.59,4.8,135.39000000000001,fear
referred to formal exercise programs,133.62,3.21,136.83,
where they can be supervised by trained,135.39,3.33,138.72,
professionals and these trained,136.83,4.23,141.06,
professionals can kind of on Taylor,138.72,4.14,142.85999999999999,neutral
exercise programs and address any,141.06,3.1,144.16,fear
individual concerns that,142.86,3.73,146.59,fear
might have we think it would also be,144.16,6.15,150.31,fear
useful to have expand roles for possibly,146.59,7.08,153.67000000000002,fear
dedicated a lifestyle and physical,150.31,6.27,156.58,happy
activity advisors will be able to sit,153.67,4.5,158.17,neutral
down with patients go through all the,156.58,3.98,160.56,
concerns,158.17,2.39,160.55999999999997,
exercise was the main factor we did,163.56,5.19,168.75,
collect some data on smoking and obesity,166.17,5.73,171.89999999999998,
so sixty-eight percent of our patient,168.75,6.739,175.489,
cohort were overweight or obese which is,171.9,6.32,178.22,NA
obviously also a risk factor for,175.489,5.441,180.93,NA
cardiovascular disease and increases the,178.22,5.17,183.39,NA
rate of side effects as well so that's,180.93,4.5,185.43,NA
another aspect that would be helped with,183.39,4.41,187.79999999999998,NA
doing more exercise and we did look,185.43,4.86,190.29000000000002,NA
briefly it's smoking levels so only,187.8,3.719,191.519,NA
seven percent of the cohort are,190.29,3.09,193.38,NA
currently smoking 52-percent we're,191.519,4.411,195.93,NA
ex-smokers so which does suggest that,193.38,4.8,198.18,NA
there's a trend towards succeeding in,195.93,6.41,202.34,NA
helping patients kind of give up smoking,198.18,4.16,202.34,NA
