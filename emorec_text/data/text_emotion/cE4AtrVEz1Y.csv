in our research we had two main aims which was to look at look at how much patients actually are doing in a typical oncology unit kind of like Bedford hospital and secondly to find out,9.4,28.799999999999997,38.199999999999996,angry
whether patients had any concerns or barriers that were limiting the exercise levels of any we used a validated screening tool for exercise known as the general practice physical activity,23.48,19.51,42.99,angry
questionnaire which is a very useful tool for kind of objectively giving a categorized and how much exercise patients are actually doing and what we found was that only eleven percent of,33.69,23.038999999999998,56.729,angry
the patients in our cohort were achieving active levels that means that eighty-nine percent were were insufficiently active and should be advised to do more exercise another,45.42,20.061,65.481,angry
aspect data rows more findings was that patients are actually more aware that exercise is good for them so the message has gotten out there I think what we need to do is to now adapt information,54.89,23.68,78.57,angry
materials so that they don't focus just on relaying the message that exercise is good for you but also to kind of understand why patients are still not doing enough exercise even though they,67.26,22.649,89.909,angry
know this and what we found is that a lot of patients are concerned about doing more exercise because for health-related reasons so because you know cancer patients they deal with a,78.57,19.799,98.369,angry
lot of stresses related to their diagnosis and the treatment so they often feel that they're too tired to do exercise there in too much pain to do exercise a lot of patients also feel,88.649,20.791,109.44,angry
that they can't schedule exercise into their busy timetables and there is still a subset of patients who are who are where that exercise good for them but are still still not sure still don't,98.609,22.259999999999998,120.869,angry
realize how much exercise that really requires so 25 percent of the patients at our cohort thought they were ready exercising enough and it turns out that they actually only twenty-five,110.1,17.899,127.999,fear
twenty-five percent of these specific patients were actually active on the GP paq so I think what we need to do is adapt information materials so that we now reassure patients that exercise can,118.819,24.702,143.52100000000002,fear
be and is safe especially if they can be referred to formal exercise programs where they can be supervised by trained professionals and these trained professionals can kind of on Taylor,130.59,19.71,150.3,fear
exercise programs and address any individual concerns that might have we think it would also be useful to have expand roles for possibly dedicated a lifestyle and physical,141.06,26.330000000000002,167.39000000000001,angry
activity advisors will be able to sit down with patients go through all the concerns exercise was the main factor we did collect some data on smoking and obesity,153.67,21.790000000000003,175.45999999999998,angry
so sixty-eight percent of our patient cohort were overweight or obese which is obviously also a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and increases the rate of side effects as well so that's,168.75,28.17,196.92000000000002,NA
another aspect that would be helped with doing more exercise and we did look briefly it's smoking levels so only seven percent of the cohort are currently smoking 52-percent we're,183.39,20.490000000000002,203.88,NA
ex-smokers so which does suggest that there's a trend towards succeeding in helping patients kind of give up smoking,193.38,15.370000000000001,208.75,NA
