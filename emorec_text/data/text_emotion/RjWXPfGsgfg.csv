to go ahead and click the subscribe button to get update every Midwife Monday but for today let's talk a little bit about the glucose tolerance test so this looks actually a really common,18.029,18.361,36.39,angry
topic I've been watching it spread all over the internet for the last couple of years that mom is just like you are looking for alternatives to that nasty Glu Cola because of all of its harsh,26.76,18.0,44.760000000000005,angry
chemicals it's nasty ingredients it's really starting to get a bad rap among the natural community traditionally since I've been trained at least midwives have,36.21,19.53,55.74,sad
offered an alternative to the Glu Cola txt and still getting the same glucose tolerance test results that are really important to the optimal health of your pregnancy so if you're wondering if the,45.42,21.75,67.17,angry
test is important the answer is yes so around 28 weeks of pregnancy your physician or Midwife is gonna be offering you a glucose tolerance test and let me start by saying this test is,56.25,20.37,76.62,angry
actually really important diabetes is rampant in the United States but particularly during pregnancy it is actually a pretty common problem particularly in Louisiana where I,66.63,22.979999999999997,89.60999999999999,angry
practice because of the diets that we have and so the glucose tolerance test really is an important test because it lets us know if you have gestational diabetes diagnosing gestational diabetes,77.46,26.339,103.79899999999999,angry
during pregnancy is really important to the health of your baby and yourself during your pregnancy however we don't have to take such harsh means to make it happen so with that said the Glu Cola,91.049,20.97,112.019,sad
that is typically offered in a traditional lab setting is just full of harsh chemicals I mean it's 50 grams of sugar as it is but adding the harsh chemicals and some,101.52,20.849,122.369,sad
of the other ingredients in the ingredients list it's not exactly the best thing to be putting in your body when you're pregnant in fact my opposition to the,112.259,16.862000000000002,129.121,sad
cause tolerance test with the glue Cola is that it's kind of equivalent to fasting and then drinking a coke and eating a Snickers bar like most pregnant women do not do that to their bodies,120.63,26.4,147.03,sad
especially my practice haha they'd be kicked out so an alternative to the glucose tolerance test that I prefer is called the pancake breakfast if you have heard of other alternatives that you'd,133.17,22.769,155.939,sad
like to share put it in the comments below this is the pancake breakfast that I offer my clients here at the natural birth house so it's the same amount of sugar which is 50 grams of sugar but,145.23,23.131,168.361,angry
it's been a much more natural package per se two pancakes with butter and syrup eggs two eggs and a glass of juice will bring us up to 50 grams of sugar along with carbohydrates healthy fats,156.39,29.069000000000003,185.459,angry
and real food that's so important real food and so my mom is will eat this two hours before they come in for their appointment and they'll come and get their fingers stuck in my office to give,170.01,24.18,194.19,sad
their glucose tolerance test results it's called a two-hour postprandial test and this is the way I test my mama's on their glucose levels and in fact there's a doctor here in town who has adopted,183.299,21.180999999999997,204.48000000000002,sad
this idea and his practice as well so what are the benefits of the glue Cola the glue Cola is really beneficial for moms who want a super tight schedule who really need to come in drink their drink,193.41,21.84,215.25,sad
they have one hour and they need to get out but the pancake breakfast although it is a two-hour test it's based on real food there are other alternatives to the pancake breakfast even there's the jelly,204.78,23.85,228.63,sad
bean test there is orange juice test and if you really just don't want to take in 50 grams of sugar in a sitting then you can always offer your Midwife or your physician to do two weeks of home,216.12,24.24,240.36,sad
monitoring of your glucose levels at home based on your normal diet I know that there are many many mamas out there who've taken that test and either vomited or passed out in fact one of my,228.87,20.158,249.02800000000002,sad
friends took the glucose tolerance test with the glue Cola passed out bail on her pregnant belly was hospitalized for three days and she actually passed her glucose check so this,239.099,25.182000000000002,264.281,sad
in my opinion this test is the most reliable way or the most convenient way to get those results so anyway if you would like to leave us some comments below about your experience either with,251.27,24.87,276.14,sad
