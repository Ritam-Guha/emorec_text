I wanted to create a video in a onesie,0.179,5.251,5.430000000000001,fear
and its accuracy it's definitely a great,1.68,6.14,7.819999999999999,fear
test to do as part of your evaluation,5.43,5.129,10.559,sad
but don't put all your eggs in that one,7.82,4.83,12.65,sad
basket because of several reasons,10.559,4.591,15.149999999999999,NA
basically its how much glucose that's,12.65,4.57,17.22,NA
sticking to your red blood cells over,15.15,4.59,19.740000000000002,NA
time so it's an average of blood sugars,17.22,4.71,21.93,NA
for like three months so if you have,19.74,4.949,24.689,NA
high sugar in your blood and it combines,21.93,5.49,27.42,NA
with the protein the red blood cell they,24.689,4.471,29.16,NA
can measure it through a test called a,27.42,3.859,31.279000000000003,NA
once-a-year it's called hemoglobin a1c,29.16,6.149,35.309,NA
now if it's 6.5 or more that would,31.279,7.87,39.149,NA
correlate to a fasting blood glucose,35.309,6.601,41.91,NA
test of 126 milligrams per deciliter and,39.149,7.32,46.469,NA
that would be diabetes also if it's this,41.91,6.629,48.538999999999994,NA
high there's also correlation with,46.469,4.32,50.789,NA
increased retinopathy which is damage to,48.539,3.991,52.53,NA
the retina and they also found if you,50.789,3.961,54.75,NA
decrease it just by one percent your,52.53,5.73,58.260000000000005,NA
death rate goes down from diabetes by 27,54.75,5.34,60.09,NA
percent your micro vascular,58.26,3.92,62.18,NA
complications the problems in the eye,60.09,5.37,65.46000000000001,NA
and also the feet the the vascular,62.18,4.93,67.11,NA
system to the nerves of your toes and,65.46,4.53,69.99,NA
your fingers and your eye goes down by,67.11,6.329,73.439,NA
37 percent also myocardial infarction,69.99,6.0,75.99,NA
goes down by 40 percent,73.439,4.651,78.08999999999999,NA
now here's the problem when you measure,75.99,4.62,80.61,NA
anyone seen if you're anemic and by the,78.09,4.919,83.009,NA
way 30 percent of the population is,80.61,5.52,86.13,NA
anemic this is going to be invalid it's,83.009,5.011,88.02,NA
going to alter the test if you have,86.13,4.71,90.83999999999999,NA
sickle cell that will also invalidate,88.02,4.26,92.28,NA
the test because there's a problem with,90.84,3.75,94.59,NA
the shape of your red blood cell if you,92.28,4.89,97.17,NA
have an iron disease it's gonna alter,94.59,5.55,100.14,NA
the a1c test but what's even worse than,97.17,7.409,104.57900000000001,NA
that is this the red blood cells die a,100.14,8.31,108.45,NA
lot sooner and a diabetic than they do a,104.579,6.601,111.17999999999999,NA
healthy person so the turnover rate for,108.45,6.09,114.54,NA
red blood cells for diabetic it is 81,111.18,6.689,117.869,NA
days versus someone that's healthy it's,114.54,6.719,121.259,NA
a hundred and forty six days so if,117.869,5.82,123.689,NA
you're measuring the red blood cells,121.259,4.771,126.03,NA
with a short period of exposure to,123.689,5.04,128.72899999999998,NA
glucose it can dramatically affect which,126.03,6.0,132.03,NA
shows up on the a1c results because it's,128.729,5.411,134.14000000000001,NA
all about how long,132.03,4.33,136.36,fear
those red blood cells are exposed to,134.14,3.83,137.97,NA
glucose in your blood,136.36,4.86,141.22000000000003,NA
better test would be fasting glucose or,137.97,7.12,145.09,NA
post mule glucose or Homa ir this is,141.22,5.099,146.319,NA
probably one of the best this will,145.09,3.45,148.54,NA
measure insulin resistance there's been,146.319,4.021,150.33999999999997,NA
a handful of people who ask me this,148.54,4.62,153.16,NA
question they keep showing up high blood,150.34,4.59,154.93,NA
sugar in the morning yet they're also,153.16,4.41,157.57,NA
showing high key challenge okay at the,154.93,5.43,160.36,NA
same time so how could you actually have,157.57,5.58,163.15,NA
high blood sugar or let's say it's a,160.36,6.33,166.69000000000003,fear
hundred or 105 and ketones that's,163.15,5.61,168.76000000000002,NA
impossible right well there's something,166.69,4.56,171.25,NA
called the dawn phenomena which occurs,168.76,4.32,173.07999999999998,NA
usually in the first part of the day,171.25,3.81,175.06,NA
where your blood sugars are high and,173.08,4.92,178.0,NA
that's coming from certain hormones like,175.06,5.959,181.019,NA
cortisol growth hormone glucagon,178.0,5.07,183.07,NA
adrenaline your body is actually,181.019,4.271,185.29,NA
generating that glucose several,183.07,4.11,187.18,NA
different ways it's turning something,185.29,4.08,189.37,NA
called the glycerol in the fat or,187.18,5.88,193.06,NA
triglycerides into glucose it's turning,189.37,7.8,197.17000000000002,NA
certain protein into glucose it's even,193.06,8.13,201.19,NA
turning ketones in the glucose so here,197.17,5.37,202.54,NA
you are you have this high sugar in the,201.19,3.03,204.22,NA
morning you're like what is going on I'm,202.54,3.09,205.63,NA
not consuming a lot of sugar,204.22,4.59,208.81,NA
well that's called gluconeogenesis this,205.63,5.97,211.6,NA
means new this means the generation or,208.81,5.429,214.239,NA
creation of so it's the making of new,211.6,6.6,218.2,NA
glucose but why because you've had this,214.239,6.331,220.57,NA
condition for quite a while called,218.2,5.849,224.04899999999998,NA
insulin resistance in some resistance,220.57,6.09,226.66,NA
basically is a protective mechanism that,224.049,5.311,229.36,NA
your body develops from having excess,226.66,5.22,231.88,NA
amount of insulin so and this takes a,229.36,5.07,234.43,NA
while to correct it could take even up,231.88,4.859,236.739,NA
to a year or a little bit longer but,234.43,3.93,238.36,NA
think about this if your cells are,236.739,4.261,241.0,NA
resisting insulin and insulin controls,238.36,5.07,243.43,NA
glucose you're not able to pull that,241.0,4.53,245.53,NA
glucose inside the cell so your body's,243.43,4.05,247.48000000000002,NA
in the state where it's sensing low,245.53,4.32,249.85,NA
sugars so it keeps making more and more,247.48,5.819,253.29899999999998,NA
even if you don't consume sugar it has,249.85,6.05,255.9,NA
to do with the feedback sensing loops,253.299,4.551,257.85,NA
because you have insulin resistance,255.9,3.91,259.81,NA
usually when you measure the fasting,257.85,4.09,261.94,NA
glucose later in the day it improves,259.81,4.56,264.37,NA
this usually happens only in the morning,261.94,4.38,266.32,NA
primarily because you if you look at the,264.37,3.45,267.82,NA
rhythm of certain hormones,266.32,4.56,270.88,NA
cortisol spikes at 8 o'clock in the,267.82,6.0,273.82,NA
morning so that is probably a big part,270.88,5.43,276.31,NA
of it I would not worry about this this,273.82,5.04,278.86,NA
is a transitional phase if you went out,276.31,4.35,280.66,NA
and did some exercise it would burn off,278.86,4.83,283.69,NA
there's sugar all this means is you had,280.66,4.65,285.31,NA
this one condition,283.69,4.14,287.83,NA
insulin resistance chronically and it's,285.31,6.36,291.67,NA
going to take a while to fix if you're,287.83,6.03,293.85999999999996,NA
