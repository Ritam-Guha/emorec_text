let's talk about why some diabetics get,0.06,5.58,5.64,
gangrene okay and others don't first of,2.82,4.8,7.619999999999999,
all what is gangrene it really has,5.64,5.039,10.678999999999998,
nothing to do with the color green but,7.62,5.46,13.08,
when you get gangrene the tissue usually,10.679,4.5,15.179,
in the feet or the toes start first and,13.08,4.26,17.34,
then sometimes in the hand start turning,15.179,5.341,20.52,
black yellow red and even kind of a,17.34,3.93,21.27,
shade of green,20.52,2.97,23.49,
now the actual word gangrene comes from,21.27,4.56,25.83,
the Latin word which means putrefaction,23.49,5.16,28.65,
dead or dying tissue and the reason why,25.83,4.769,30.598999999999997,
the tissue is dying is simply because,28.65,4.56,33.21,
you're exposing the tissue with way too,30.599,5.011,35.61,
much sugar okay so if your blood sugar,33.21,5.369,38.579,
is too high that sugar goes to the,35.61,4.59,40.2,
vascular system and the tiny little,38.579,4.111,42.69,
blood vessels especially starting in the,40.2,4.879,45.079,
toes and sometimes in the hands because,42.69,5.04,47.73,
you start off from the heart with larger,45.079,4.151,49.230000000000004,
blood vessels and then it gets down to,47.73,3.69,51.419999999999995,
the bottom of the feet to the tiny,49.23,4.29,53.519999999999996,
capillaries then it comes back through,51.42,4.17,55.59,
the venous system but when you expose,53.52,5.519,59.039,
glucose to your vascular system you get,55.59,5.719,61.309000000000005,
all sorts of destruction you get massive,59.039,5.931,64.97,
oxidation creates free radicals,61.309,5.591,66.89999999999999,
hemorrhaging so you're getting bleeding,64.97,5.38,70.35,
getting clotting the the vascular system,66.9,5.85,72.75,
is becoming thicker and stiffer and,70.35,4.67,75.02,
you're getting a healing response,72.75,4.68,77.43,
inflammatory response and all of this is,75.02,4.389,79.40899999999999,
going to stop the blood flow to the,77.43,5.79,83.22000000000001,
tissues and to the nerves now the lining,79.409,6.741,86.15,
on the inside of the vascular system is,83.22,6.24,89.46,
called the endothelial layer and this,86.15,7.24,93.39,
layer does not require insulin to,89.46,8.07,97.53,
transport glucose into those cells which,93.39,5.88,99.27,
means that if you have insulin,97.53,4.65,102.18,
resistance you won't have any resistance,99.27,6.029,105.29899999999999,
there if there's too much glucose it's,102.18,5.189,107.369,
going to drive it right into the tissues,105.299,3.39,108.68900000000001,
and that's really what's creating the,107.369,3.631,111.0,
damage if you look at insulin resistance,108.689,4.47,113.15899999999999,
as a protective mechanism to block,111.0,4.229,115.229,
insulin and glucose from going in the,113.159,4.32,117.47900000000001,
tissues because it's toxic large amounts,115.229,5.07,120.299,
and there's certain tissues that don't,117.479,4.951,122.42999999999999,
require insulin and those usually get,120.299,4.381,124.68,
hammered okay the brain cells for,122.43,4.259,126.68900000000001,
example don't require insulin you have,124.68,4.889,129.56900000000002,
the brain blood barrier which does but,126.689,5.011,131.7,
not the actual brain cells the red blood,129.569,4.111,133.67999999999998,
cells don't require insulin,131.7,3.45,135.14999999999998,
this is why when you get a test with,133.68,4.44,138.12,
called a1c they're measuring the amount,135.15,6.3,141.45000000000002,
of exposure of that sugar to the red,138.12,5.339,143.459,
blood cell to determine if you're a,141.45,4.5,145.95,
diabetic or not so the more sugar in the,143.459,5.011,148.47,
blood the more vascular problems you're,145.95,5.009,150.959,
gonna have and that's gonna stop the,148.47,6.12,154.59,
nutrition to the tissues and the oxygen,150.959,4.681,155.64000000000001,
to the tissues,154.59,2.729,157.31900000000002,
and it's gonna start dying and that's,155.64,3.81,159.45,
what's called gangrene so you have a,157.319,4.771,162.08999999999997,
combination of dead tissue ulcers and,159.45,5.069,164.51899999999998,
severe nerve damage a lot of times,162.09,4.319,166.409,
there's pain involved until the nerve is,164.519,3.3,167.81900000000002,
dead and then you have no pain it's,166.409,3.061,169.47,
completely numb now what could be done,167.819,3.54,171.35899999999998,
for this condition well the most,169.47,4.349,173.819,
important thing is to avoid this in the,171.359,6.061,177.42000000000002,
first place by not consuming so much,173.819,6.87,180.689,
sugar okay doing Kido and I have so you,177.42,5.7,183.11999999999998,
never end up in the situation but if you,180.689,4.621,185.31,
already have this situation there might,183.12,3.6,186.72,
be a couple things that you can do,185.31,4.17,189.48,
depending on how severe it is let's say,186.72,4.26,190.98,
you don't want to get surgery and remove,189.48,3.24,192.72,
your toes okay and maybe you have,190.98,3.33,194.31,
certain tissues that are not so bad,192.72,4.079,196.799,
maybe you have an ulcer or some,194.31,7.679,201.989,
infection well guess what the FDA did,196.799,9.27,206.06900000000002,
approve in 2004 maggot therapy and I'm,201.989,6.03,208.019,
not I'm not being sarcastic they,206.069,5.161,211.23,
actually put maggots in the ulcer to,208.019,6.541,214.56,
clean up the dead tissue certain types,211.23,5.64,216.86999999999998,
of maggots eat the dead tissue and they,214.56,4.289,218.849,
don't eat the healthy tissue so they,216.87,4.5,221.37,
clear out the infection interesting in,218.849,5.67,224.51899999999998,
fact they're finding that it's even more,221.37,5.64,227.01,
effective than certain surgeries because,224.519,4.89,229.409,
it disinfects the area and it stimulates,227.01,5.339,232.349,
healing and within one or two days it,229.409,4.83,234.239,
could be totally cleaned out so these,232.349,4.11,236.459,
maggots actually release enzymes and,234.239,5.541,239.78,
they also release like a broad-spectrum,236.459,6.21,242.669,
antibiotic to kill HUF the infection is,239.78,4.989,244.769,
quite interesting but of course you,242.669,4.38,247.049,
would want to make sure that you change,244.769,4.56,249.329,
your diet so you don't keep exposing,247.049,5.101,252.15,
these tissues to glucose you don't want,249.329,4.951,254.28,
to just rely on medication to control,252.15,4.38,256.53000000000003,
your blood sugars medication basically,254.28,5.009,259.289,
takes the excess blood sugar and in it,256.53,3.81,260.34,
has to put it somewhere it doesn't,259.289,3.6,262.889,
evaporate it lowers it but it puts it,260.34,5.25,265.59,
somewhere in the in the tissues but we,262.889,4.051,266.94,
want to actually eliminate the sugar,265.59,2.31,267.9,
from the,266.94,2.9,269.84,
the other thing that I would recommend,267.9,4.26,272.15999999999997,
especially if you're getting let's say,269.84,3.73,273.57,
you're getting nerve damage but maybe,272.16,4.2,276.36,
it's not gangrene yet is to start taking,273.57,6.21,279.78,
benfotiamine but in folk too mean is a B,276.36,6.24,282.6,
vitamin that is made into a fat soluble,279.78,5.7,285.47999999999996,
version so it penetrates the myelin,282.6,5.49,288.09000000000003,
sheath it goes right into the nerves and,285.48,5.28,290.76,
actually can help to protect against the,288.09,4.95,293.03999999999996,
high sugar and the complications and,290.76,4.2,294.96,
it's great for peripheral neuropathy,293.04,3.21,296.25,
it's called benfotiamine,294.96,4.47,299.43,
get some take like four tablets a day,296.25,5.58,301.83,
spread out and you'll see some really,299.43,4.71,304.14,
wonderful changes with that anyway I,301.83,4.38,306.21,
wanted to create this video to explain,304.14,5.88,310.02,
why diabetics get gangrene and what's,306.21,7.23,313.44,
involved thanks for watching if you're,310.02,5.61,315.63,
