the common current understanding about,9.04,3.28,12.319999999999999,neutral
peripheral neuropathy is that it's a,10.88,2.4,13.280000000000001,neutral
progressive and,12.32,4.719,17.039,neutral
incurable disease process so all of the,13.28,5.999,19.279,neutral
treatments designed around peripheral,17.039,3.761,20.8,neutral
neuropathy is sort of,19.279,4.08,23.359,neutral
to try and manage it you know medicines,20.8,3.68,24.48,neutral
like lyrica,23.359,4.561,27.92,neutral
or gabapentin or narcotic pain,24.48,4.719,29.199,neutral
medication,27.92,3.759,31.679000000000002,NA
and then there's a whole slew of other,29.199,4.081,33.28,NA
treatments that really sort of,31.679,5.201,36.879999999999995,NA
cross over into the snake oil you know,33.28,7.119,40.399,neutral
department none of that even claims to,36.88,4.96,41.84,neutral
cure neuropathy it's sort of,40.399,5.441,45.84,NA
all just to try and manage the symptoms,41.84,4.0,45.84,NA
[Music],47.01,5.15,52.16,neutral
one of the most important advances in,49.2,5.679,54.879000000000005,neutral
the treatment of peripheral neuropathy,52.16,4.879,57.038999999999994,neutral
is the concept of what is actually,54.879,3.52,58.399,neutral
causing the pain,57.039,3.601,60.64,neutral
in many patients with peripheral,58.399,3.361,61.76,neutral
neuropathy,60.64,2.719,63.359,neutral
the actual clinical symptoms the,61.76,3.52,65.28,NA
numbness the burning the tingling the,63.359,3.041,66.4,NA
weakness etc,65.28,3.76,69.04,neutral
is secondary to mechanical compression,66.4,3.84,70.24000000000001,neutral
that has developed,69.04,3.04,72.08000000000001,neutral
so these nerves are being squeezed or,70.24,3.76,74.0,neutral
pinched there's a metabolic,72.08,5.12,77.2,neutral
process in diabetics for example or,74.0,4.96,78.96,neutral
somebody with hypothyroidism,77.2,3.2,80.4,neutral
although very often you can't really,78.96,3.36,82.32,neutral
identify whatever the underlying process,80.4,2.88,83.28,neutral
is,82.32,5.04,87.36,neutral
but that's not as important as the um,83.28,5.68,88.96000000000001,neutral
what it does to the nerves which is it,87.36,3.439,90.799,neutral
causes these nerves to swell,88.96,4.32,93.28,neutral
and so these nerves become pinched they,90.799,4.561,95.36000000000001,neutral
run in tight spaces especially around,93.28,4.64,97.92,neutral
joints and and places like that and so,95.36,3.2,98.56,neutral
if you have a,97.92,2.64,100.56,neutral
defined space and all of a sudden the,98.56,3.919,102.479,neutral
nerve starts to swell and become larger,100.56,4.08,104.64,NA
pretty soon the tissue around the nerve,102.479,3.521,106.0,NA
starts acting as a mechanical,104.64,3.439,108.07900000000001,neutral
compression point on the nerve,106.0,4.56,110.56,neutral
and this is what is actually causing,108.079,3.841,111.91999999999999,neutral
much of the clinical symptoms in,110.56,5.28,115.84,NA
patients with peripheral neuropathy,111.92,3.92,115.84,NA
[Music],116.18,8.589,124.769,neutral
if you can identify which nerves and,125.759,4.64,130.399,NA
exactly at what locations,128.319,4.161,132.48,sad
the pressure on the nerves is being,130.399,4.081,134.48,neutral
applied you can go in surgically and,132.48,4.08,136.56,neutral
decompress the nerves the concept is the,134.48,2.64,137.11999999999998,neutral
same as,136.56,2.319,138.879,neutral
you would do for somebody who has carpal,137.12,6.72,143.84,neutral
tunnel syndrome,138.879,4.961,143.84,neutral
it's well accepted to decompress nerves,146.64,4.08,150.72,neutral
in the upper extremity for somebody with,148.879,3.761,152.64,neutral
diabetes who has the same symptoms in,150.72,3.92,154.64,neutral
their hands and arms as they do in their,152.64,3.599,156.23899999999998,NA
lower legs and feet but nobody ever,154.64,3.12,157.76,neutral
thinks about doing surgery for the,156.239,3.121,159.36,neutral
nerves down the lower legs,157.76,3.28,161.04,neutral
and it's the same process that's going,159.36,4.56,163.92000000000002,NA
on so that's really an important,161.04,5.279,166.319,neutral
point to understand in regards with,163.92,4.92,168.83999999999997,neutral
treatment of peripheral neuropathy,166.319,5.521,171.83999999999997,NA
