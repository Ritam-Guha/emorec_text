the common current understanding about,9.04,3.28,12.319999999999999,
peripheral neuropathy is that it's a,10.88,2.4,13.280000000000001,
progressive and,12.32,4.719,17.039,
incurable disease process so all of the,13.28,5.999,19.279,
treatments designed around peripheral,17.039,3.761,20.8,happy
neuropathy is sort of,19.279,4.08,23.359,happy
to try and manage it you know medicines,20.8,3.68,24.48,neutral
like lyrica,23.359,4.561,27.92,
or gabapentin or narcotic pain,24.48,4.719,29.199,
medication,27.92,3.759,31.679000000000002,
and then there's a whole slew of other,29.199,4.081,33.28,
treatments that really sort of,31.679,5.201,36.879999999999995,
cross over into the snake oil you know,33.28,7.119,40.399,happy
department none of that even claims to,36.88,4.96,41.84,happy
cure neuropathy it's sort of,40.399,5.441,45.84,
all just to try and manage the symptoms,41.84,4.0,45.84,
[Music],47.01,5.15,52.16,
one of the most important advances in,49.2,5.679,54.879000000000005,
the treatment of peripheral neuropathy,52.16,4.879,57.038999999999994,
is the concept of what is actually,54.879,3.52,58.399,neutral
causing the pain,57.039,3.601,60.64,neutral
in many patients with peripheral,58.399,3.361,61.76,neutral
neuropathy,60.64,2.719,63.359,
the actual clinical symptoms the,61.76,3.52,65.28,
numbness the burning the tingling the,63.359,3.041,66.4,
weakness etc,65.28,3.76,69.04,
is secondary to mechanical compression,66.4,3.84,70.24000000000001,
that has developed,69.04,3.04,72.08000000000001,neutral
so these nerves are being squeezed or,70.24,3.76,74.0,neutral
pinched there's a metabolic,72.08,5.12,77.2,neutral
process in diabetics for example or,74.0,4.96,78.96,neutral
somebody with hypothyroidism,77.2,3.2,80.4,neutral
although very often you can't really,78.96,3.36,82.32,neutral
identify whatever the underlying process,80.4,2.88,83.28,neutral
is,82.32,5.04,87.36,neutral
but that's not as important as the um,83.28,5.68,88.96000000000001,neutral
what it does to the nerves which is it,87.36,3.439,90.799,neutral
causes these nerves to swell,88.96,4.32,93.28,neutral
and so these nerves become pinched they,90.799,4.561,95.36000000000001,neutral
run in tight spaces especially around,93.28,4.64,97.92,neutral
joints and and places like that and so,95.36,3.2,98.56,neutral
if you have a,97.92,2.64,100.56,neutral
defined space and all of a sudden the,98.56,3.919,102.479,neutral
nerve starts to swell and become larger,100.56,4.08,104.64,
pretty soon the tissue around the nerve,102.479,3.521,106.0,
starts acting as a mechanical,104.64,3.439,108.07900000000001,
compression point on the nerve,106.0,4.56,110.56,neutral
and this is what is actually causing,108.079,3.841,111.91999999999999,neutral
much of the clinical symptoms in,110.56,5.28,115.84,
patients with peripheral neuropathy,111.92,3.92,115.84,
[Music],116.18,8.589,124.769,
if you can identify which nerves and,125.759,4.64,130.399,
exactly at what locations,128.319,4.161,132.48,happy
the pressure on the nerves is being,130.399,4.081,134.48,neutral
applied you can go in surgically and,132.48,4.08,136.56,neutral
decompress the nerves the concept is the,134.48,2.64,137.11999999999998,neutral
same as,136.56,2.319,138.879,neutral
you would do for somebody who has carpal,137.12,6.72,143.84,
tunnel syndrome,138.879,4.961,143.84,
it's well accepted to decompress nerves,146.64,4.08,150.72,
in the upper extremity for somebody with,148.879,3.761,152.64,
diabetes who has the same symptoms in,150.72,3.92,154.64,
their hands and arms as they do in their,152.64,3.599,156.23899999999998,
lower legs and feet but nobody ever,154.64,3.12,157.76,neutral
thinks about doing surgery for the,156.239,3.121,159.36,neutral
nerves down the lower legs,157.76,3.28,161.04,
and it's the same process that's going,159.36,4.56,163.92000000000002,
on so that's really an important,161.04,5.279,166.319,neutral
point to understand in regards with,163.92,4.92,168.83999999999997,neutral
treatment of peripheral neuropathy,166.319,5.521,171.83999999999997,
nowadays,168.84,3.0,171.84,
