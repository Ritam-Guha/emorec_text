okay one of the things that you'll hear,0.03,3.99,4.0200000000000005,angry
a lot about if you have a diagnosis of,2.04,5.19,7.23,angry
diabetes there's two words hyper which,4.02,7.079,11.099,angry
is high and hypo which is low glycaemia,7.23,5.55,12.780000000000001,angry
glycaemia is just to do with your blood,11.099,4.441,15.54,angry
sugar level I'll probably use a lot of,12.78,5.19,17.97,angry
hand gestures like this because high is,15.54,4.11,19.65,angry
high and low is low and you want to,17.97,3.149,21.119,angry
actually try and find the balance in the,19.65,3.45,23.099999999999998,angry
middle where you're safe and functional,21.119,4.67,25.789,angry
everything's working well now,23.1,6.63,29.73,angry
hypoglycemia think Oh hypo is low is,25.789,7.18,32.969,angry
when you've got either too much insulin,29.73,7.95,37.68,angry
or too little sugar typically most,32.969,8.16,41.129000000000005,angry
people feel symptoms it's pretty much an,37.68,6.51,44.19,angry
insulin overdose but because it's part,41.129,4.711,45.839999999999996,angry
of the rest of your body there's other,44.19,4.11,48.3,angry
bits going on as well because your body,45.84,5.789,51.629000000000005,angry
is basically reacting to a threat you,48.3,4.71,53.01,angry
might get a bit of adrenaline being,51.629,3.691,55.32,angry
kicked out as well so some of the,53.01,3.689,56.699,angry
symptoms you can even put down to,55.32,2.61,57.93,neutral
adrenaline as opposed to just the,56.699,3.0,59.699,angry
insulin overdose but what you will feel,57.93,6.479,64.409,angry
probably is shaky a bit confused a,59.699,7.71,67.40899999999999,angry
little bit uncoordinated some people get,64.409,6.03,70.43900000000001,angry
a bit sweaty some people see how they,67.409,4.89,72.299,angry
can see their their eyes go a bit funny,70.439,3.421,73.86,angry
they can usually tell they'll be looking,72.299,3.031,75.33000000000001,neutral
at something I think that oh you know I,73.86,4.049,77.909,angry
can notice it it's not quite right now,75.33,5.94,81.27,angry
the best thing possible is if you keep,77.909,4.951,82.86,angry
your blood testing kit with you is to do,81.27,4.01,85.28,angry
a blood test to be certain that you have,82.86,6.06,88.92,angry
found yourself going into hypo there's,85.28,5.14,90.42,angry
just a chance that you could be,88.92,4.32,93.24000000000001,angry
confusing it a hypo could be confused,90.42,4.5,94.92,angry
with feeling very nervous about,93.24,3.69,96.92999999999999,angry
something for example again it's that,94.92,5.87,100.79,angry
similar feeling of adrenaline kicking in,96.93,6.21,103.14,angry
having said that when you're having a,100.79,4.39,105.18,angry
hypo doing a blood test can be rather,103.14,4.74,107.88,angry
tricky if that's I usually know if I'm,105.18,4.71,109.89,angry
having a hypo because I'm trying to do,107.88,2.97,110.85,angry
all this you're trying to get the,109.89,2.25,112.14,angry
strip's in and if you sort of end up,110.85,2.82,113.66999999999999,angry
throwing the thing away,112.14,4.17,116.31,angry
and hitting a wall it's because you're,113.67,6.299,119.96900000000001,angry
just losing it the other factor with,116.31,5.94,122.25,angry
adrenaline and insulin is you can get,119.969,5.671,125.64,angry
very short-tempered and snappy and that,122.25,6.27,128.52,angry
can be another sign it's important that,125.64,5.28,130.92,angry
you can learn to recognize your symptoms,128.52,2.91,131.43,angry
and,130.92,2.84,133.76,angry
importance really that you can keep,131.43,5.46,136.89000000000001,angry
having your symptoms if you spend an,133.76,4.929,138.689,angry
awful lot of time having hypose you,136.89,3.06,139.95,angry
might actually start losing your,138.689,4.05,142.739,angry
sensitivity to those symptoms and one of,139.95,4.23,144.17999999999998,angry
the other things that's really helpful,142.739,4.051,146.79,angry
is for the people around you do them a,144.18,4.35,148.53,angry
favor let them know that you have,146.79,3.72,150.51,angry
diabetes and that if certain things,148.53,5.579,154.109,angry
start to happen they can be part of the,150.51,6.3,156.81,angry
help to get you out of your hypo all,154.109,4.291,158.4,angry
you'll really need is some sugar in,156.81,5.64,162.45,angry
whatever form possible liquids sometimes,158.4,5.97,164.37,angry
easier than having to chew if you're,162.45,5.789,168.23899999999998,angry
having a bad hypo bad anything under,164.37,5.369,169.739,angry
when you do a blood test anything under,168.239,5.041,173.28,angry
four would be very very borderline but,169.739,4.62,174.359,angry
by the time you're three point eight,173.28,2.689,175.969,angry
you're definitely having a hypo and,174.359,4.05,178.40900000000002,angry
effectively the lower you go the more,175.969,4.24,180.209,angry
sugar you're going to get a need to pull,178.409,3.78,182.189,neutral
yourself up and it also might make a bit,180.209,6.18,186.389,angry
more time to come back up so you want,182.189,5.7,187.88899999999998,angry
you want to address the hype as soon as,186.389,4.05,190.43900000000002,angry
you can once you've had diabetes quite a,187.889,3.78,191.669,angry
long time and you've had quite a lot,190.439,3.901,194.34,angry
hypose I mean they are inevitable you,191.669,5.91,197.579,angry
will get them the real issue is to try,194.34,4.92,199.26,angry
not to have too many and when you do,197.579,3.63,201.209,angry
have them try not to have any major ones,199.26,5.369,204.629,angry
and to always be prepared and have some,201.209,5.941,207.15,angry
sugar handy the people around you might,204.629,4.92,209.54899999999998,angry
be able to say you know you're acting a,207.15,4.619,211.769,angry
bit funny or you're looking a bit shaky,209.549,4.47,214.019,angry
and that those can be the people that,211.769,4.021,215.79,angry
help to tell you if you're going a bit,214.019,3.33,217.34900000000002,angry
wobbly if you're not picking picking up,215.79,3.75,219.54,angry
the symptoms yourself obviously I've,217.349,3.45,220.79899999999998,angry
been using the phrase feeling a bit,219.54,3.93,223.47,angry
wobbly it's very commonly used so not,220.799,4.351,225.15,angry
everyone says I'm feeling hypo or I'm,223.47,4.019,227.489,angry
going into hypo and I don't know any,225.15,4.859,230.00900000000001,angry
want to use this hyperglycemia wobbly,227.489,6.06,233.549,angry
dizzy we all have our own ways of,230.009,6.72,236.72899999999998,angry
describing it but try not to overdo it,233.549,6.66,240.209,angry
when you have a hypo your body once your,236.729,5.311,242.04000000000002,angry
body is recovered and getting into sort,240.209,4.53,244.739,angry
of recovery situation it too will start,242.04,5.039,247.07899999999998,angry
kicking out sugars so you don't need to,244.739,4.68,249.419,angry
overdo it your main thing you need is to,247.079,4.141,251.22,angry
try and keep your head if you can and,249.419,4.68,254.09900000000002,angry
sit down and take some time it should,251.22,5.699,256.919,angry
take about 15-20 minutes to adjust your,254.099,5.01,259.109,angry
sugar levels at or at least pull you,256.919,4.85,261.769,angry
away from a hypo,259.109,4.43,263.539,angry
if you could you certainly need to be,261.769,3.661,265.43,angry
very careful if you're driving you,263.539,3.81,267.349,angry
should have tested before you drive to,265.43,3.54,268.97,angry
avoid the possibility of having a hypo,267.349,4.981,272.33,angry
but if you happen to be driving you,268.97,4.47,273.44000000000005,angry
shouldn't really be blood testing at the,272.33,2.76,275.09,angry
wheel and should pull over and do a,273.44,3.379,276.819,angry
blood test and if you are having a hypo,275.09,5.579,280.669,angry
treat it and wait at least 15 minutes,276.819,5.41,282.22900000000004,angry
you should wait until your Sugar's up to,280.669,4.291,284.96,angry
at least 5 again as far as treating it,282.229,5.37,287.599,angry
as concerns you can keep things that,284.96,6.45,291.40999999999997,angry
either don't go off don't melt you know,287.599,6.451,294.05,angry
and are just available they can be in,291.41,5.129,296.53900000000004,angry
your bag they can be in a desk school,294.05,4.47,298.52000000000004,angry
desk an office desk can be in a glove,296.539,3.961,300.5,angry
compartment and the only thing you have,298.52,4.049,302.56899999999996,angry
to remember to do is if you use one when,300.5,4.889,305.389,angry
you're having a hypo replace it so that,302.569,6.621,309.19,angry
next time you need one there is one bare,305.389,3.801,309.19,angry
