hi guys I'm back in this video we're,0.0,3.27,3.27,
gonna discuss something called metabolic,1.86,5.209,7.069,
syndrome it's called syndrome X okay and,3.27,6.21,9.48,
we're going to talk about it it's really,7.069,4.931,12.0,
kind of a combination of several things,9.48,4.5,13.98,
like high blood pressure belly fat high,12.0,4.17,16.17,
sugar cholesterol and in other countries,13.98,4.11,18.09,
you can add a couple other things in,16.17,5.88,22.05,
there as well okay so it's so,18.09,6.15,24.240000000000002,
interesting because if you then look up,22.05,5.67,27.72,
something called hyper insulin emia high,24.24,6.24,30.479999999999997,
insulin okay they'll say that this,27.72,6.45,34.17,
condition is associated with metabolic,30.48,5.759,36.239000000000004,
syndrome and these symptoms okay but,34.17,4.86,39.03,
really it causes it okay so I'm going to,36.239,5.611,41.849999999999994,
show you something out of Wikipedia it,39.03,6.32,45.35,
talks about high insulin,41.85,3.5,45.35,
hyperinsulinemia okay this is associated,45.44,5.799,51.239,fear
with hypertension I love that it's not,49.11,5.31,54.42,fear
associated it's causing okay I'll,51.239,6.121,57.36,fear
explain it surely obesity high,54.42,5.7,60.120000000000005,neutral
cholesterol and high blood glucose,57.36,5.1,62.46,neutral
alright this candies conditions,60.12,3.81,63.93,fear
collectively are known as metabolic,62.46,5.13,67.59,fear
syndrome this close association between,63.93,6.27,70.2,fear
high insulin and conditions of metabolic,67.59,6.15,73.74000000000001,fear
syndrome suggest or relate a common,70.2,7.59,77.79,fear
mechanism of pathology this just,73.74,7.26,81.0,
confuses people it doesn't suggest it it,77.79,6.57,84.36000000000001,
says there they're unable to connect the,81.0,5.28,86.28,
dots effectively they're kind of,84.36,3.6,87.96,
switching and putting it all in this,86.28,5.549,91.82900000000001,fear
confusion here high insulin has been,87.96,6.65,94.61,fear
shown to play a role in obese,91.829,5.371,97.19999999999999,fear
hypertension by increasing sodium,94.61,6.31,100.92,fear
retention no that's that's insignificant,97.2,8.19,105.39,fear
here we go linked to obesity since high,100.92,6.239,107.159,fear
insulin and obesity are so closely,105.39,3.03,108.42,neutral
linked it's hard to determine whether,107.159,4.14,111.299,fear
high insulin causes obesity or obesity,108.42,6.0,114.42,fear
causes high insulin or both no it's not,111.299,5.161,116.46000000000001,fear
it's pretty easy the fact is when you,114.42,5.97,120.39,
actually get fat you you develop insulin,116.46,6.24,122.69999999999999,
resistance which increases insulin but,120.39,5.009,125.399,fear
you have to get fat initially it was the,122.7,5.479,128.179,fear
high insulin that got you there okay so,125.399,7.081,132.48,fear
obesity is characterized by an excess of,128.179,7.001,135.18,fear
adipose tissue insulin increases the,132.48,4.56,137.04,fear
synthesis of fatty acid from glucose,135.18,4.08,139.26000000000002,fear
okay we knew that so basically insulin,137.04,7.169,144.209,fear
turns glucose into fat and it inhibits,139.26,6.78,146.04,fear
the breakdown of fat well good,144.209,4.471,148.68,fear
right there thank you it's just,146.04,5.64,151.67999999999998,fear
basically they just said that insulin,148.68,5.43,154.11,fear
makes fat and it prevents the loss of,151.68,5.04,156.72,fear
fat so it causes obesity they're just,154.11,4.17,158.28,fear
they're actually telling you there's a,156.72,3.21,159.93,fear
link you're giving you some confusion,158.28,2.789,161.069,fear
then they actually tell you the truth,159.93,2.76,162.69,fear
right underneath here it says high,161.069,8.721,169.79,fear
insulin may lead to diabetes hello high,162.69,10.56,173.25,fear
cholesterol hypertension because it,169.79,6.419,176.209,fear
makes the arteries stiff coronary heart,173.25,7.65,180.9,fear
disease cardiovascular disease and,176.209,8.53,184.739,fear
weight gain okay we knew that treatment,180.9,4.14,185.04,fear
okay,184.739,2.881,187.62,fear
treatment is typically achieved via diet,185.04,5.039,190.07899999999998,neutral
and exercise although metformin may be,187.62,7.229,194.84900000000002,neutral
used to reduce insulin okay alright then,190.079,6.421,196.5,fear
they go to say a low carbohydrate diet,194.849,4.371,199.22,fear
is effective in reducing,196.5,5.25,201.75,fear
hyperinsulinemia Wow,199.22,4.18,203.4,fear
they're actually telling you what to do,201.75,4.109,205.859,
lower the carbs thank you very much I've,203.4,5.07,208.47,
been waiting for that a healthy diet,205.859,4.261,210.12,neutral
that is low in simple sugars and,208.47,3.48,211.95,fear
processed carbohydrates and high in,210.12,4.41,214.53,fear
fiber of course they're gonna get to the,211.95,5.069,217.01899999999998,fear
grains shortly and vegetable protein,214.53,3.78,218.31,fear
which by the way there's not a lot of,217.019,3.601,220.62,surprise
protein and vegetables there's some but,218.31,5.61,223.92000000000002,fear
you comes with a lot of carb it's often,220.62,4.709,225.329,fear
recommended this includes your placing,223.92,3.24,227.16,fear
the white bread with whole-grain bread,225.329,4.141,229.47,fear
here we go well it has near the same,227.16,4.199,231.359,angry
glycemic index okay and I'll tell you,229.47,3.48,232.95,neutral
one thing when people eat whole grain,231.359,4.831,236.19,fear
bread there they basically don't eat,232.95,4.47,237.42,fear
whole grain bread they're eating whole,236.19,6.0,242.19,fear
wheat bread okay so go to the grocery,237.42,7.02,244.44,fear
store it's it's very very it's confusing,242.19,4.59,246.78,fear
to people alright so then they say the,244.44,4.409,248.849,fear
reducing intakes of food like starts or,246.78,4.859,251.639,fear
potatoes increasing legumes which have a,248.849,6.351,255.2,fear
bit of carbs in green vegetables,251.639,6.061,257.7,fear
particularly soy so they're basically,255.2,4.36,259.56,neutral
want to emphasize soy at the very end,257.7,4.05,261.75,neutral
part I wonder why that is well if you,259.56,4.02,263.58,neutral
actually look up some data and so I'm,261.75,3.81,265.56,fear
gonna put a link down below,263.58,4.92,268.5,fear
soybean oil induces obesity diabetes,265.56,6.27,271.83,fear
insulin resistance and fatty liver in,268.5,6.9,275.4,fear
mice okay so we'll just have to test it,271.83,5.64,277.46999999999997,neutral
out if it's true in humans but the point,275.4,6.12,281.52,fear
is that 98% of the soy out there is GM,277.47,7.35,284.82000000000005,fear
oh so these people are not stupid I,281.52,5.43,286.95,fear
think they just have to define it like,284.82,4.95,289.77,fear
this because of the food manufacturing,286.95,4.32,291.27,neutral
companies and the chemical companies,289.77,4.05,293.82,fear
behind them are really pulling the,291.27,4.619,295.889,fear
strings okay so anyway I just wanted to,293.82,4.34,298.15999999999997,fear
let you know that metabolic syndrome is,295.889,7.021,302.91,fear
purely caused by high insulin all right,298.16,7.21,305.37,fear
that's the cause this is the effect,302.91,4.53,307.44,
these are the effects it's not,305.37,4.049,309.419,
associated it's causing it all right,307.44,3.84,311.28,fear
thanks for watching hey if you're,309.419,3.181,312.59999999999997,fear
