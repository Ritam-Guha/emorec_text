hi guys I'm back in this video we're gonna discuss something called metabolic syndrome it's called syndrome X okay and we're going to talk about it it's really kind of a combination of several things,0.0,24.12,24.12,sad
like high blood pressure belly fat high sugar cholesterol and in other countries you can add a couple other things in there as well okay so it's so interesting because if you then look up,12.0,25.980000000000004,37.980000000000004,NA
something called hyper insulin emia high insulin okay they'll say that this condition is associated with metabolic syndrome and these symptoms okay but really it causes it okay so I'm going to,24.24,28.92,53.16,sad
show you something out of Wikipedia it talks about high insulin hyperinsulinemia okay this is associated with hypertension I love that it's not associated it's causing okay I'll,39.03,27.049999999999997,66.08,sad
explain it surely obesity high cholesterol and high blood glucose alright this candies conditions collectively are known as metabolic syndrome this close association between,54.42,26.01,80.43,sad
high insulin and conditions of metabolic syndrome suggest or relate a common mechanism of pathology this just confuses people it doesn't suggest it it says there they're unable to connect the,67.59,32.85,100.44,sad
dots effectively they're kind of switching and putting it all in this confusion here high insulin has been shown to play a role in obese hypertension by increasing sodium,84.36,27.48,111.84,sad
retention no that's that's insignificant here we go linked to obesity since high insulin and obesity are so closely linked it's hard to determine whether high insulin causes obesity or obesity,97.2,27.599,124.799,sad
causes high insulin or both no it's not it's pretty easy the fact is when you actually get fat you you develop insulin resistance which increases insulin but you have to get fat initially it was the,111.299,27.859,139.15800000000002,sad
high insulin that got you there okay so obesity is characterized by an excess of adipose tissue insulin increases the synthesis of fatty acid from glucose okay we knew that so basically insulin,125.399,29.891000000000002,155.29,sad
turns glucose into fat and it inhibits the breakdown of fat well good right there thank you it's just basically they just said that insulin makes fat and it prevents the loss of,139.26,27.361,166.62099999999998,sad
fat so it causes obesity they're just they're actually telling you there's a link you're giving you some confusion then they actually tell you the truth right underneath here it says high,154.11,21.65,175.76000000000002,sad
insulin may lead to diabetes hello high cholesterol hypertension because it makes the arteries stiff coronary heart disease cardiovascular disease and weight gain okay we knew that treatment,162.69,37.299,199.989,sad
okay treatment is typically achieved via diet and exercise although metformin may be used to reduce insulin okay alright then they go to say a low carbohydrate diet,184.739,25.941000000000003,210.68,sad
is effective in reducing hyperinsulinemia Wow they're actually telling you what to do lower the carbs thank you very much I've been waiting for that a healthy diet,196.5,22.87,219.37,sad
that is low in simple sugars and processed carbohydrates and high in fiber of course they're gonna get to the grains shortly and vegetable protein which by the way there's not a lot of,208.47,20.34,228.81,sad
protein and vegetables there's some but you comes with a lot of carb it's often recommended this includes your placing the white bread with whole-grain bread here we go well it has near the same,218.31,21.899,240.209,sad
glycemic index okay and I'll tell you one thing when people eat whole grain bread there they basically don't eat whole grain bread they're eating whole wheat bread okay so go to the grocery,229.47,25.801,255.271,sad
store it's it's very very it's confusing to people alright so then they say the reducing intakes of food like starts or potatoes increasing legumes which have a bit of carbs in green vegetables,242.19,26.27,268.46,sad
particularly soy so they're basically want to emphasize soy at the very end part I wonder why that is well if you actually look up some data and so I'm gonna put a link down below,255.2,21.159999999999997,276.36,sad
soybean oil induces obesity diabetes insulin resistance and fatty liver in mice okay so we'll just have to test it out if it's true in humans but the point is that 98% of the soy out there is GM,265.56,32.28,297.84000000000003,sad
oh so these people are not stupid I think they just have to define it like this because of the food manufacturing companies and the chemical companies behind them are really pulling the,281.52,23.369,304.889,sad
strings okay so anyway I just wanted to let you know that metabolic syndrome is purely caused by high insulin all right that's the cause this is the effect these are the effects it's not,293.82,27.150000000000002,320.96999999999997,sad
associated it's causing it all right thanks for watching hey if you're interested in finding out the underlying cause of your body issues click the link below and take the evaluation quints,307.44,21.520999999999997,328.961,NA
