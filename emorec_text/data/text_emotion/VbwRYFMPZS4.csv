Australia is facing an increasing,5.089,5.201,10.29,
epidemic of type 2 diabetes there are,7.29,4.62,11.91,
now approximately 1 million people,10.29,3.84,14.129999999999999,
living with diabetes and around a,11.91,5.24,17.15,
hundred thousand new diagnoses each year,14.13,4.95,19.080000000000002,
obesity is thought to be the primary,17.15,4.15,21.299999999999997,
cause of type 2 diabetes in people who,19.08,5.609,24.689,
are genetically predisposed in part one,21.3,5.46,26.76,
we explained how inflammation in type 2,24.689,4.321,29.009999999999998,
diabetes destroys the pancreas tissue,26.76,4.23,30.990000000000002,
and dramatically decreases insulin,29.01,4.95,33.96,
production here we describe the insulin,30.99,6.06,37.05,
receptor in type 2 diabetes what we have,33.96,5.939,39.899,
discovered is the molecular detail of,37.05,5.25,42.3,
how the hormone insulin binds to its,39.899,4.171,44.07,
so-called receptor protein on the,42.3,4.5,46.8,
surface of a cell and instructs that,44.07,5.55,49.62,
cell to take up glucose from the blood,46.8,6.239,53.038999999999994,
and destroy it as an energy source the,49.62,6.54,56.16,
receptor itself actually spans the cell,53.039,5.401,58.44,
membrane so it has a part outside a part,56.16,5.789,61.949,
inside and insulin binds to the part,58.44,7.83,66.27,
that is outside instant is a small,61.949,6.151,68.1,
molecule whose structure was determined,66.27,5.91,72.17999999999999,
a long time ago in 1969 but it's been,68.1,5.64,73.74,
unknown how it interacts with the,72.18,3.66,75.84,
receptor and that is what we have,73.74,4.41,78.14999999999999,
discovered and it's interaction are,75.84,4.98,80.82000000000001,
characterized as a molecular handshake,78.15,6.3,84.45,
as the two proteins dot together when,80.82,6.42,87.24,
insulin binds to the outside parts of,84.45,5.07,89.52000000000001,
the receptor it brings the two halves of,87.24,4.739,91.979,
the receptor together and at the same,89.52,5.69,95.21,
time the two parts inside of the cell,91.979,7.28,99.259,
unwind and make contact,95.21,4.049,99.259,
these two proteins then activate each,102.06,5.7,107.76,
other,105.52,2.24,107.75999999999999,
this activation allows the insulin,119.549,5.86,125.409,
signal to enter the cell specialized,122.229,5.311,127.53999999999999,
proteins interact with the activated,125.409,7.021,132.43,
receptor just below the cell surface the,127.54,6.93,134.47,
receptor activates these proteins and,132.43,4.169,136.59900000000002,
they in turn are able to activate,134.47,4.92,139.39,
multiple other proteins in a long signal,136.599,7.441,144.04,
cascade this complex signaling process,139.39,6.48,145.86999999999998,
eventually tells the cell to take up,144.04,6.57,150.60999999999999,
glucose for use as an energy source the,145.87,7.05,152.92000000000002,
long signal cascade allows tight control,150.61,4.59,155.20000000000002,
of the signaling process as it can be,152.92,4.68,157.6,
turned on or off at many different,155.2,9.05,164.25,
points along the way in type 2 diabetes,157.6,9.03,166.63,
we believe insulin binds to its receptor,164.25,4.93,169.18,
normally but the signal is not sending,166.63,4.74,171.37,
to the cell and the signal cascade does,169.18,4.92,174.1,
not develop this is known as insulin,171.37,3.56,174.93,
resistance,174.1,3.389,177.489,
this means that glucose cannot enter the,174.93,5.77,180.70000000000002,
cell and blood glucose remains high over,177.489,5.28,182.769,fear
time high glucose levels damage many,180.7,5.4,186.1,fear
different organs insulin as you know has,182.769,5.371,188.14000000000001,fear
been used to treat diabetes for a very,186.1,4.71,190.81,
long time but all of those formulations,188.14,5.43,193.57,
and types of insulin that have been used,190.81,5.07,195.88,
in the diabetes context have been,193.57,4.41,197.98,
designed and formulated without any,195.88,4.62,200.5,
knowledge of the way in which instant,197.98,4.53,202.51,NA
actually interacts with a receptor and,200.5,3.78,204.28,NA
now for the first time we've got a,202.51,4.77,207.28,NA
picture of that and we can use that into,204.28,5.94,210.22,NA
the design of new insulins that could be,207.28,4.95,212.23,NA
used for the treatment of diabetes so we,210.22,4.62,214.84,NA
could imagine for example the design of,212.23,4.74,216.97,NA
instance that act for a longer period of,214.84,4.59,219.43,NA
time design of instance that act more,216.97,4.859,221.829,NA
quickly design of instance that are more,219.43,5.399,224.829,NA
stable upon storage and that's where,221.829,7.431,229.26000000000002,NA
we'd like to go with our discovery,224.829,4.431,229.26000000000002,NA
you,233.12,2.06,235.18,NA
