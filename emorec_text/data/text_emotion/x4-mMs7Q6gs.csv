diabetes affects the small blood vessels all over your body and the eye is sort of the canary in the coal mine it's the first place that gets into trouble,0.08,21.560000000000002,21.64,angry
[Music] what happens is you get damage to blood vessels and the blood vessels in the eye you have areas with lousy blood supply,8.6,23.878999999999998,32.479,angry
those areas say i'm hungry i want more blood supply and they scream for help and what they end up doing is making chemicals in the eye,22.8,15.361,38.161,angry
called cytokines that are well-meaning it sounds like a great idea they make new blood vessels grow they make regular vessels leaky but those new blood vessels have a,30.32,18.4,48.72,angry
tendency to break and bleed and scar down causing blindness that's what's called proliferative diabetic retinopathy,40.16,17.119,57.278999999999996,angry
diabetic retinopathy but new blood vessels proliferate the other major way diabetics lose vision is from this i'm hungry factor making,48.399,18.641,67.03999999999999,angry
regular blood vessels swell and leak and a swollen retina doesn't work well just like a swollen brain doesn't think well and a swollen knee doesn't work well,57.44,16.0,73.44,angry
fortunately we have made big breakthroughs in the treatments of these diseases mainly by blocking that i'm hungry factor there are several,65.68,19.679000000000002,85.35900000000001,angry
erythropoietin hypoxia inducible factor big names and vegf vaso endothelial growth factor vegf's the important one because we have specific blockers for vegf,74.799,27.201,102.0,angry
that have made a revolutionary change in diabetics not going blind if they're treated early enough not only can using an anti-vegf stop the i'm hungry factor and stop the new blood,88.24,23.119,111.359,angry
vessels and help the swelling it can also improve the overall blood supply and circulation with continued use there are some patients that get,100.799,16.401,117.2,angry
swelling in the retina and decrease vision but the brain is really good at ignoring one-eyed problems and most patients that get into that trouble,109.2,14.959,124.159,angry
have denial issues of their own certainly get a screening eye exam with your local eye doctor who's used to seeing retinas doesn't have to be a world expert like,116.479,18.321,134.8,angry
one of us if they're signs of retinopathy you need to be watched more closely you want to be picked up at an annual exam when you start to get these new,125.68,17.04,142.72,angry
blood vessels because if we can get you sooner we can prevent you know any of the potential vision loss you might have had that otherwise,134.4,16.32,150.72,angry
we'd have to save with modern microsurgical techniques we're able to pull some rabbits out of the hat take some totally blind patients and,142.56,15.599,158.159,NA
recover however it is much easier if you watch those blood sugars and and let us be in that first group of patients,150.4,17.919999999999998,168.32,NA
where we can take things slowly as opposed to surgical intervention or getting in stage disease with lots of chronic diabetic macular edema,158.879,23.761,182.64,NA
you,172.72,2.08,174.8,NA
