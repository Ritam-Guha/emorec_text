diabetes affects the small blood vessels,0.08,3.44,3.52,fear
all over your body,2.32,3.12,5.4399999999999995,surprise
and the eye is sort of the canary in the,3.52,4.16,7.68,sad
coal mine it's the first place that gets,5.44,3.16,8.600000000000001,NA
into trouble,7.68,7.68,15.36,sad
[Music],8.6,8.679,17.279,sad
what happens is you get damage to blood,15.36,3.28,18.64,NA
vessels and,17.279,2.961,20.24,NA
the blood vessels in the eye you have,18.64,4.16,22.8,NA
areas with lousy blood supply,20.24,4.799,25.038999999999998,NA
those areas say i'm hungry i want more,22.8,3.12,25.92,NA
blood supply,25.039,2.48,27.519000000000002,surprise
and they scream for help and what they,25.92,3.519,29.439,NA
end up doing is making chemicals in the,27.519,2.801,30.32,NA
eye,29.439,3.441,32.88,NA
called cytokines that are well-meaning,30.32,4.239,34.559,NA
it sounds like a great idea,32.88,3.519,36.399,NA
they make new blood vessels grow they,34.559,3.84,38.399,NA
make regular vessels leaky,36.399,3.761,40.160000000000004,NA
but those new blood vessels have a,38.399,3.041,41.44,NA
tendency to break,40.16,3.44,43.599999999999994,NA
and bleed and scar down causing,41.44,3.36,44.8,surprise
blindness,43.6,2.959,46.559000000000005,surprise
that's what's called proliferative,44.8,3.599,48.399,surprise
diabetic retinopathy,46.559,3.761,50.32,NA
diabetic retinopathy but new blood,48.399,3.121,51.52,NA
vessels proliferate,50.32,3.84,54.16,NA
the other major way diabetics lose,51.52,3.519,55.039,NA
vision,54.16,3.28,57.44,sad
is from this i'm hungry factor making,55.039,4.881,59.92,NA
regular blood vessels swell and leak,57.44,4.24,61.68,NA
and a swollen retina doesn't work well,59.92,3.68,63.6,NA
just like a swollen brain doesn't think,61.68,3.519,65.199,NA
well and a swollen knee doesn't work,63.6,2.08,65.68,NA
well,65.199,2.481,67.67999999999999,NA
fortunately we have made big,65.68,3.84,69.52000000000001,NA
breakthroughs in the treatments of these,67.68,3.2,70.88000000000001,NA
diseases,69.52,3.12,72.64,NA
mainly by blocking that i'm hungry,70.88,3.919,74.79899999999999,NA
factor there are several,72.64,5.6,78.24,NA
erythropoietin hypoxia inducible factor,74.799,4.721,79.52000000000001,NA
big names,78.24,4.64,82.88,NA
and vegf vaso endothelial growth factor,79.52,5.68,85.19999999999999,NA
vegf's the important one because we have,82.88,5.36,88.24,NA
specific blockers for vegf,85.2,6.8,92.0,NA
that have made a revolutionary change,88.24,6.16,94.39999999999999,NA
in diabetics not going blind if they're,92.0,3.759,95.759,NA
treated early enough,94.4,4.24,98.64,NA
not only can using an anti-vegf stop the,95.759,5.04,100.799,NA
i'm hungry factor and stop the new blood,98.64,3.92,102.56,NA
vessels and help the swelling,100.799,4.081,104.88000000000001,NA
it can also improve the overall blood,102.56,4.32,106.88,NA
supply and circulation with continued,104.88,2.72,107.6,NA
use,106.88,2.32,109.19999999999999,NA
there are some patients that get,107.6,2.96,110.55999999999999,NA
swelling in the retina and decrease,109.2,2.239,111.43900000000001,NA
vision,110.56,2.64,113.2,NA
but the brain is really good at ignoring,111.439,3.921,115.36,NA
one-eyed problems and most patients that,113.2,3.279,116.479,NA
get into that trouble,115.36,2.88,118.24,NA
have denial issues of their own,116.479,4.0,120.479,NA
certainly get a screening eye exam,118.24,4.239,122.479,NA
with your local eye doctor who's used to,120.479,3.28,123.759,NA
seeing retinas,122.479,3.201,125.67999999999999,neutral
doesn't have to be a world expert like,123.759,3.601,127.36,NA
one of us,125.68,3.52,129.20000000000002,NA
if they're signs of retinopathy you need,127.36,3.119,130.479,NA
to be watched more closely,129.2,3.44,132.64,NA
you want to be picked up at an annual,130.479,3.921,134.4,sad
exam when you start to get these new,132.64,3.04,135.67999999999998,NA
blood vessels,134.4,3.76,138.16,NA
because if we can get you sooner we can,135.68,3.68,139.36,NA
prevent,138.16,2.88,141.04,NA
you know any of the potential vision,139.36,3.2,142.56,NA
loss you might have had that otherwise,141.04,2.8,143.84,NA
we'd have to save,142.56,3.679,146.239,NA
with modern microsurgical techniques,143.84,4.08,147.92000000000002,NA
we're able to pull some rabbits out of,146.239,2.241,148.48000000000002,NA
the hat,147.92,2.48,150.39999999999998,NA
take some totally blind patients and,148.48,3.119,151.599,NA
recover,150.4,3.839,154.239,NA
however it is much easier if you watch,151.599,4.0,155.599,NA
those blood sugars,154.239,3.36,157.59900000000002,NA
and and let us be in that first group of,155.599,3.28,158.879,NA
patients,157.599,3.441,161.04,NA
where we can take things slowly as,158.879,4.08,162.959,NA
opposed to surgical intervention,161.04,4.88,165.92,NA
or getting in stage disease with lots of,162.959,3.441,166.4,NA
chronic,165.92,5.92,171.83999999999997,NA
diabetic macular edema,166.4,5.44,171.84,NA
