actually i snuck in a third case i was,3.12,4.0,7.12,fear
pretty bad which hopefully i won't get,5.359,3.681,9.04,fear
into too much trouble but essentially,7.12,3.519,10.639,fear
you know during our case presentations,9.04,3.2,12.239999999999998,fear
myself and my colleagues we kind of took,10.639,4.321,14.959999999999999,sad
different topics with cll patients,12.24,5.2,17.44,sad
i took uh treatment naive older,14.96,6.079,21.039,sad
individuals with cll so we looked at a,17.44,6.96,24.400000000000002,fear
patient who had comorbid illnesses but,21.039,4.641,25.68,fear
also,24.4,4.44,28.84,sad
was a tp53 mutated patient and an,25.68,6.879,32.559,sad
unmutated ighv so essentially i kind of,28.84,5.719,34.559,sad
highlighted data looking at how to treat,32.559,4.16,36.718999999999994,sad
individuals in that scenario and so we,34.559,4.641,39.199999999999996,sad
actually updated given the updated data,36.719,4.881,41.6,sad
with resonate two so right so ibrutinib,39.2,4.8,44.0,sad
versus chloramber cell looking at that,41.6,4.639,46.239000000000004,sad
nice you know seven-year follow-up with,44.0,4.16,48.16,sad
a very nice progression-free survival,46.239,4.48,50.718999999999994,sad
for patients at seven years very,48.16,4.559,52.718999999999994,sad
encouraging data sort of shows,50.719,4.0,54.719,sad
highlights sort of the efficacy,52.719,4.0,56.719,sad
there in treatment naive patients who,54.719,3.201,57.92,sad
are older,56.719,2.561,59.28,fear
and in addition,57.92,3.6,61.52,fear
with patients who are started on a btk,59.28,4.64,63.92,sad
inhibitor it was like the nice long,61.52,4.8,66.32000000000001,sad
follow-up to suggest that patients who,63.92,4.64,68.56,sad
maintain therapy over time their,66.32,4.799,71.119,sad
responses also increase over time so,68.56,4.4,72.96000000000001,sad
complete remissions typically when you,71.119,3.601,74.72,sad
start a btk inhibit are usually in the,72.96,4.72,77.67999999999999,sad
single digits um but now we were seeing,74.72,5.039,79.759,sad
you know patients who uh you know seven,77.68,3.68,81.36000000000001,sad
years their their complete remission,79.759,4.241,84.0,sad
response increases to like 34,81.36,4.48,85.84,sad
so again sort of highlighting some of,84.0,4.32,88.32,sad
that data um you know that long-term,85.84,5.76,91.60000000000001,sad
data in addition uh i also highlighted a,88.32,4.96,93.27999999999999,sad
little bit about because these were all,91.6,4.24,95.83999999999999,sad
updates at the recent congresses updates,93.28,4.4,97.68,sad
with elevate tn so looking at,95.84,4.959,100.799,sad
acalabrutinib plus or minus obinutuzumab,97.68,4.2,101.88000000000001,sad
versus,100.799,2.881,103.68,sad
chlorambicillinobinituzumab and again,101.88,4.599,106.479,sad
favoring the ocalabutinib arms with a,103.68,5.52,109.2,sad
very very nice pfs so,106.479,5.6,112.079,sad
again highlighting how btk inhibitors do,109.2,4.8,114.0,sad
really really well for patients who are,112.079,3.841,115.91999999999999,sad
older maybe with comorbidities who are,114.0,4.64,118.64,sad
treatment naive and if they have,115.92,4.64,120.56,sad
high-risk features so the case i did was,118.64,4.56,123.2,sad
a gentleman with a tp53 mutation you,120.56,4.879,125.43900000000001,sad
know we tend to favor btk inhibitors,123.2,4.48,127.68,sad
because we have the longest data and,125.439,4.721,130.16,fear
really they've done so well the you know,127.68,5.6,133.28,fear
the tp53 or the 17p deleted patients,130.16,5.439,135.599,fear
really have done well with btk inhibitor,133.28,3.92,137.2,fear
based therapy,135.599,4.401,140.0,fear
um looking again at an older individual,137.2,4.8,142.0,fear
i also discussed a little bit about,140.0,5.76,145.76,sad
cll14 so venetoclax and obinutuzumab uh,142.0,5.92,147.92,sad
versus openintuzumab and chlorambicell,145.76,4.0,149.76,sad
and again highlighting how well patients,147.92,4.56,152.48,sad
do with venetoclax and obentuzumab in,149.76,4.32,154.07999999999998,sad
that setting,152.48,4.56,157.04,sad
the pfs data not as robust for patients,154.08,6.56,160.64000000000001,sad
with tp53 or deleted 17p so so you know,157.04,5.12,162.16,sad
i kind of highlighted that many of us,160.64,3.92,164.55999999999997,sad
still recommend a btk inhibitor based,162.16,4.88,167.04,sad
therapy but really nice data so our,164.56,5.12,169.68,sad
older patients who are treatment naive,167.04,5.279,172.319,fear
really have you know can choose from btk,169.68,4.559,174.239,sad
inhibitor based therapy versus,172.319,4.481,176.79999999999998,sad
venetoclax so benetuzumab,174.239,4.64,178.879,fear
um and obviously comorbidities will come,176.8,4.32,181.12,sad
into play so depending upon what you,178.879,3.841,182.72,sad
know what comorbidities your older,181.12,3.36,184.48000000000002,sad
patient may have you might select you,182.72,3.12,185.84,sad
know if they have cardiac issues you,184.48,3.28,187.76,sad
might select venetoclax if they have,185.84,3.679,189.519,sad
renal issues you might go with the btk,187.76,3.92,191.67999999999998,sad
inhibitor but really highlighting more,189.519,4.881,194.4,sad
robust long-term follow-up data from,191.68,4.479,196.15900000000002,sad
some of these studies like resonate two,194.4,4.64,199.04,neutral
and elevate tn and the cll14 data so,196.159,4.961,201.12,fear
that was the that was some of the cases,199.04,4.08,203.12,sad
that i highlighted for treatment naive,201.12,4.8,205.92000000000002,sad
older individual and then i also snuck,203.12,5.839,208.959,sad
in a little case there that looked at um,205.92,4.48,210.39999999999998,sad
a younger,208.959,2.801,211.76,sad
it's probably irrelevant doesn't matter,210.4,3.119,213.519,sad
about the age but a younger gentleman,211.76,4.72,216.48,sad
who was already on a btk inhibitor,213.519,5.36,218.87900000000002,sad
and doing well but then had evidence of,216.48,4.479,220.959,sad
progressive disease after four years,218.879,4.481,223.35999999999999,sad
being on therapy and so i think with,220.959,4.721,225.68,sad
longer data since ibrutinib was first to,223.36,5.36,228.72000000000003,sad
market and we've had that since 2013 you,225.68,4.88,230.56,sad
know now we're starting to see btk,228.72,3.92,232.64,sad
resistant mutations and so i highlighted,230.56,4.319,234.879,neutral
a little bit about resistant mutations,232.64,5.519,238.159,sad
uh you know having a btkc 481 s mutation,234.879,6.08,240.959,sad
plc gamma 2 mutations uh you know the,238.159,4.561,242.72,sad
development of these resistant mutations,240.959,3.681,244.64000000000001,sad
is starting to emerge,242.72,3.36,246.08,sad
and we have,244.64,3.2,247.83999999999997,sad
now some data about what to do about,246.08,3.84,249.92000000000002,happy
those individuals so one the most,247.84,4.08,251.92000000000002,NA
experience that we have is utilizing,249.92,4.48,254.39999999999998,NA
venetoclax in this scenario,251.92,4.319,256.239,NA
so we have data with venetoclax for,254.4,3.679,258.079,NA
patients who have become resistant to a,256.239,3.921,260.15999999999997,NA
btk and then of course we have some,258.079,4.4,262.479,NA
newer agents we have the non-covalent,260.16,5.2,265.36,NA
btk inhibitors such as pertibrutinib and,262.479,4.401,266.88,NA
others coming down the pike that are,265.36,4.08,269.44,NA
being evaluated with some some of that,266.88,4.72,271.6,NA
data that was presented at ash and some,269.44,4.8,274.24,NA
of the recent congresses at asco and eha,271.6,4.159,275.759,NA
really suggesting that some of these,274.24,4.239,278.479,NA
non-covalent btk inhibitors can salvage,275.759,4.88,280.639,NA
patients who develop a btk resistant,278.479,4.801,283.28,NA
mutation or even who have had venetoclax,280.639,4.721,285.36,NA
and were resistant to venetoclax so,283.28,4.08,287.35999999999996,NA
alternative options of therapy,285.36,4.48,289.84000000000003,NA
highlighting for patients who again,287.36,4.88,292.24,NA
might have developed a btk resistant,289.84,4.639,294.479,NA
mutation so those are the those are the,292.24,6.92,299.16,NA
cases and what i focused on,294.479,4.681,299.15999999999997,NA
