actually i snuck in a third case i was pretty bad which hopefully i won't get into too much trouble but essentially you know during our case presentations myself and my colleagues we kind of took,3.12,18.720999999999997,21.840999999999998,sad
different topics with cll patients i took uh treatment naive older individuals with cll so we looked at a patient who had comorbid illnesses but also,12.24,27.320000000000004,39.56,sad
was a tp53 mutated patient and an unmutated ighv so essentially i kind of highlighted data looking at how to treat individuals in that scenario and so we actually updated given the updated data,25.68,26.28,51.96,sad
with resonate two so right so ibrutinib versus chloramber cell looking at that nice you know seven-year follow-up with a very nice progression-free survival for patients at seven years very,39.2,22.638,61.83800000000001,sad
encouraging data sort of shows highlights sort of the efficacy there in treatment naive patients who are older and in addition,50.719,17.362000000000002,68.081,sad
with patients who are started on a btk inhibitor it was like the nice long follow-up to suggest that patients who maintain therapy over time their responses also increase over time so,59.28,23.278999999999996,82.559,sad
complete remissions typically when you start a btk inhibit are usually in the single digits um but now we were seeing you know patients who uh you know seven years their their complete remission,71.119,21.281,92.4,sad
response increases to like 34 so again sort of highlighting some of that data um you know that long-term data in addition uh i also highlighted a little bit about because these were all,81.36,23.759999999999998,105.12,sad
updates at the recent congresses updates with elevate tn so looking at acalabrutinib plus or minus obinutuzumab versus chlorambicillinobinituzumab and again,93.28,21.039,114.319,sad
favoring the ocalabutinib arms with a very very nice pfs so again highlighting how btk inhibitors do really really well for patients who are older maybe with comorbidities who are,103.68,24.401,128.08100000000002,sad
treatment naive and if they have high-risk features so the case i did was a gentleman with a tp53 mutation you know we tend to favor btk inhibitors because we have the longest data and,115.92,23.279999999999998,139.2,sad
really they've done so well the you know the tp53 or the 17p deleted patients really have done well with btk inhibitor based therapy um looking again at an older individual,127.68,24.16,151.84,sad
i also discussed a little bit about cll14 so venetoclax and obinutuzumab uh versus openintuzumab and chlorambicell and again highlighting how well patients do with venetoclax and obentuzumab in,140.0,24.56,164.56,sad
that setting the pfs data not as robust for patients with tp53 or deleted 17p so so you know i kind of highlighted that many of us still recommend a btk inhibitor based,152.48,25.039999999999996,177.51999999999998,sad
therapy but really nice data so our older patients who are treatment naive really have you know can choose from btk inhibitor based therapy versus venetoclax so benetuzumab,164.56,24.079,188.639,sad
um and obviously comorbidities will come into play so depending upon what you know what comorbidities your older patient may have you might select you know if they have cardiac issues you,176.8,17.921000000000003,194.721,sad
might select venetoclax if they have renal issues you might go with the btk inhibitor but really highlighting more robust long-term follow-up data from some of these studies like resonate two,185.84,21.599,207.439,sad
and elevate tn and the cll14 data so that was the that was some of the cases that i highlighted for treatment naive older individual and then i also snuck in a little case there that looked at um,196.159,24.16,220.319,sad
a younger it's probably irrelevant doesn't matter about the age but a younger gentleman who was already on a btk inhibitor and doing well but then had evidence of,208.959,20.479,229.438,sad
progressive disease after four years being on therapy and so i think with longer data since ibrutinib was first to market and we've had that since 2013 you know now we're starting to see btk,218.879,23.362000000000002,242.24099999999999,sad
resistant mutations and so i highlighted a little bit about resistant mutations uh you know having a btkc 481 s mutation plc gamma 2 mutations uh you know the development of these resistant mutations,230.56,24.16,254.72,sad
is starting to emerge and we have now some data about what to do about those individuals so one the most experience that we have is utilizing,242.72,18.96,261.68,sad
venetoclax in this scenario so we have data with venetoclax for patients who have become resistant to a btk and then of course we have some newer agents we have the non-covalent,251.92,21.519,273.43899999999996,NA
btk inhibitors such as pertibrutinib and others coming down the pike that are being evaluated with some some of that data that was presented at ash and some of the recent congresses at asco and eha,262.479,22.16,284.639,NA
really suggesting that some of these non-covalent btk inhibitors can salvage patients who develop a btk resistant mutation or even who have had venetoclax and were resistant to venetoclax so,274.24,22.720999999999997,296.961,NA
alternative options of therapy highlighting for patients who again might have developed a btk resistant mutation so those are the those are the cases and what i focused on,285.36,25.599999999999998,310.96000000000004,NA
