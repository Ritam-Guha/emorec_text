actually i snuck in a third case i was,3.12,4.0,7.12,fear
pretty bad which hopefully i won't get,5.359,3.681,9.04,fear
into too much trouble but essentially,7.12,3.519,10.639,fear
you know during our case presentations,9.04,3.2,12.239999999999998,fear
myself and my colleagues we kind of took,10.639,4.321,14.959999999999999,surprise
different topics with cll patients,12.24,5.2,17.44,surprise
i took uh treatment naive older,14.96,6.079,21.039,surprise
individuals with cll so we looked at a,17.44,6.96,24.400000000000002,fear
patient who had comorbid illnesses but,21.039,4.641,25.68,fear
also,24.4,4.44,28.84,surprise
was a tp53 mutated patient and an,25.68,6.879,32.559,surprise
unmutated ighv so essentially i kind of,28.84,5.719,34.559,surprise
highlighted data looking at how to treat,32.559,4.16,36.718999999999994,fear
individuals in that scenario and so we,34.559,4.641,39.199999999999996,fear
actually updated given the updated data,36.719,4.881,41.6,fear
with resonate two so right so ibrutinib,39.2,4.8,44.0,fear
versus chloramber cell looking at that,41.6,4.639,46.239000000000004,fear
nice you know seven-year follow-up with,44.0,4.16,48.16,fear
a very nice progression-free survival,46.239,4.48,50.718999999999994,fear
for patients at seven years very,48.16,4.559,52.718999999999994,angry
encouraging data sort of shows,50.719,4.0,54.719,fear
highlights sort of the efficacy,52.719,4.0,56.719,fear
there in treatment naive patients who,54.719,3.201,57.92,fear
are older,56.719,2.561,59.28,fear
and in addition,57.92,3.6,61.52,fear
with patients who are started on a btk,59.28,4.64,63.92,neutral
inhibitor it was like the nice long,61.52,4.8,66.32000000000001,surprise
follow-up to suggest that patients who,63.92,4.64,68.56,surprise
maintain therapy over time their,66.32,4.799,71.119,fear
responses also increase over time so,68.56,4.4,72.96000000000001,fear
complete remissions typically when you,71.119,3.601,74.72,fear
start a btk inhibit are usually in the,72.96,4.72,77.67999999999999,fear
single digits um but now we were seeing,74.72,5.039,79.759,fear
you know patients who uh you know seven,77.68,3.68,81.36000000000001,fear
years their their complete remission,79.759,4.241,84.0,surprise
response increases to like 34,81.36,4.48,85.84,fear
so again sort of highlighting some of,84.0,4.32,88.32,fear
that data um you know that long-term,85.84,5.76,91.60000000000001,fear
data in addition uh i also highlighted a,88.32,4.96,93.27999999999999,fear
little bit about because these were all,91.6,4.24,95.83999999999999,fear
updates at the recent congresses updates,93.28,4.4,97.68,fear
with elevate tn so looking at,95.84,4.959,100.799,fear
acalabrutinib plus or minus obinutuzumab,97.68,4.2,101.88000000000001,fear
versus,100.799,2.881,103.68,fear
chlorambicillinobinituzumab and again,101.88,4.599,106.479,fear
favoring the ocalabutinib arms with a,103.68,5.52,109.2,angry
very very nice pfs so,106.479,5.6,112.079,angry
again highlighting how btk inhibitors do,109.2,4.8,114.0,angry
really really well for patients who are,112.079,3.841,115.91999999999999,sad
older maybe with comorbidities who are,114.0,4.64,118.64,sad
treatment naive and if they have,115.92,4.64,120.56,fear
high-risk features so the case i did was,118.64,4.56,123.2,fear
a gentleman with a tp53 mutation you,120.56,4.879,125.43900000000001,angry
know we tend to favor btk inhibitors,123.2,4.48,127.68,fear
because we have the longest data and,125.439,4.721,130.16,fear
really they've done so well the you know,127.68,5.6,133.28,fear
the tp53 or the 17p deleted patients,130.16,5.439,135.599,fear
really have done well with btk inhibitor,133.28,3.92,137.2,fear
based therapy,135.599,4.401,140.0,fear
um looking again at an older individual,137.2,4.8,142.0,fear
i also discussed a little bit about,140.0,5.76,145.76,fear
cll14 so venetoclax and obinutuzumab uh,142.0,5.92,147.92,fear
versus openintuzumab and chlorambicell,145.76,4.0,149.76,fear
and again highlighting how well patients,147.92,4.56,152.48,fear
do with venetoclax and obentuzumab in,149.76,4.32,154.07999999999998,fear
that setting,152.48,4.56,157.04,sad
the pfs data not as robust for patients,154.08,6.56,160.64000000000001,fear
with tp53 or deleted 17p so so you know,157.04,5.12,162.16,fear
i kind of highlighted that many of us,160.64,3.92,164.55999999999997,fear
still recommend a btk inhibitor based,162.16,4.88,167.04,fear
therapy but really nice data so our,164.56,5.12,169.68,fear
older patients who are treatment naive,167.04,5.279,172.319,fear
really have you know can choose from btk,169.68,4.559,174.239,fear
inhibitor based therapy versus,172.319,4.481,176.79999999999998,surprise
venetoclax so benetuzumab,174.239,4.64,178.879,fear
um and obviously comorbidities will come,176.8,4.32,181.12,fear
into play so depending upon what you,178.879,3.841,182.72,fear
know what comorbidities your older,181.12,3.36,184.48000000000002,fear
patient may have you might select you,182.72,3.12,185.84,fear
know if they have cardiac issues you,184.48,3.28,187.76,fear
might select venetoclax if they have,185.84,3.679,189.519,fear
renal issues you might go with the btk,187.76,3.92,191.67999999999998,fear
inhibitor but really highlighting more,189.519,4.881,194.4,sad
robust long-term follow-up data from,191.68,4.479,196.15900000000002,angry
some of these studies like resonate two,194.4,4.64,199.04,angry
and elevate tn and the cll14 data so,196.159,4.961,201.12,fear
that was the that was some of the cases,199.04,4.08,203.12,fear
that i highlighted for treatment naive,201.12,4.8,205.92000000000002,angry
older individual and then i also snuck,203.12,5.839,208.959,fear
in a little case there that looked at um,205.92,4.48,210.39999999999998,fear
a younger,208.959,2.801,211.76,sad
it's probably irrelevant doesn't matter,210.4,3.119,213.519,fear
about the age but a younger gentleman,211.76,4.72,216.48,fear
who was already on a btk inhibitor,213.519,5.36,218.87900000000002,fear
and doing well but then had evidence of,216.48,4.479,220.959,fear
progressive disease after four years,218.879,4.481,223.35999999999999,fear
being on therapy and so i think with,220.959,4.721,225.68,fear
longer data since ibrutinib was first to,223.36,5.36,228.72000000000003,angry
market and we've had that since 2013 you,225.68,4.88,230.56,surprise
know now we're starting to see btk,228.72,3.92,232.64,surprise
resistant mutations and so i highlighted,230.56,4.319,234.879,surprise
a little bit about resistant mutations,232.64,5.519,238.159,surprise
uh you know having a btkc 481 s mutation,234.879,6.08,240.959,surprise
plc gamma 2 mutations uh you know the,238.159,4.561,242.72,surprise
development of these resistant mutations,240.959,3.681,244.64000000000001,fear
is starting to emerge,242.72,3.36,246.08,fear
and we have,244.64,3.2,247.83999999999997,fear
now some data about what to do about,246.08,3.84,249.92000000000002,
those individuals so one the most,247.84,4.08,251.92000000000002,
experience that we have is utilizing,249.92,4.48,254.39999999999998,
venetoclax in this scenario,251.92,4.319,256.239,NA
so we have data with venetoclax for,254.4,3.679,258.079,NA
patients who have become resistant to a,256.239,3.921,260.15999999999997,NA
btk and then of course we have some,258.079,4.4,262.479,NA
newer agents we have the non-covalent,260.16,5.2,265.36,NA
btk inhibitors such as pertibrutinib and,262.479,4.401,266.88,NA
others coming down the pike that are,265.36,4.08,269.44,NA
being evaluated with some some of that,266.88,4.72,271.6,NA
data that was presented at ash and some,269.44,4.8,274.24,NA
of the recent congresses at asco and eha,271.6,4.159,275.759,NA
really suggesting that some of these,274.24,4.239,278.479,NA
non-covalent btk inhibitors can salvage,275.759,4.88,280.639,NA
patients who develop a btk resistant,278.479,4.801,283.28,NA
mutation or even who have had venetoclax,280.639,4.721,285.36,NA
and were resistant to venetoclax so,283.28,4.08,287.35999999999996,NA
alternative options of therapy,285.36,4.48,289.84000000000003,NA
highlighting for patients who again,287.36,4.88,292.24,NA
might have developed a btk resistant,289.84,4.639,294.479,NA
mutation so those are the those are the,292.24,6.92,299.16,NA
cases and what i focused on,294.479,4.681,299.15999999999997,NA
