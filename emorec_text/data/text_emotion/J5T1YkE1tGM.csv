[Music] hi I'm dr. January Hill the very opportune general surgeon in Macon Georgia and today we're going to talk about recovery after bariatric surgery,9.62,23.54,33.16,sad
so that is another common question I hear about from patients number one recovery time is a lot quicker than it was historically generally speaking you would have surgery in most people go,21.24,26.849000000000004,48.089,sad
home 24 to 48 hours after their very Ettrick procedure we do a fast track as far as getting you up to walk immediately after surgery we also encourage drinking liquid diets,35.219,29.041,64.26,sad
so your surgeon wants you to be actively engaged in your activities after surgery and once we discharge you home we expect you to walk around most people can go back to work in two to three weeks,49.41,30.599999999999998,80.00999999999999,sad
some people take as long as six weeks depending on what kind of what type of job so your restrictions it might vary based on your career so if you're lifting if you're someone who loves,65.64,27.258999999999997,92.899,sad
heavy boxes or 50 or 60 pound crates probably keep you out for six weeks because generally speaking a lot of times the employers won't allow restrictions so it just it varies but we,77.759,31.781,109.53999999999999,sad
don't expect you to recover for surgery for next six months people actually feel better than expected it's pretty well tolerant these days and we can know that largely due to the fact that we do this,94.17,22.559,116.729,sad
minimally invasive or laparoscopically it's it's faster speedy speedy recovery time and less pain so people who want to get on about their lives one thing I will tell you there is some gas pain,106.259,27.39,133.649,sad
associated with bariatric surgery because the way we do the operation we do it using a laparoscope we make tiny little incisions you're down the wall and we pass trocars to,119.46,23.941000000000003,143.401,sad
instruments and we also put up a camera near your belly button well you could gasp looking a TV screen operator or for some people would play video games women claim video games anyway with all that,131.61,23.099999999999998,154.71,sad
gas we try to evacuate a lot of that gas however there's still something that's still trapped and your body has to expel in one of the ways you can get rid of that gas is to walk around okay no thing,143.01,24.3,167.31,sad
your search has been asking are you passing latest or okay so farting is really good after surgery that's going to help you feel better and expel the gas so that is great try to let loose,155.7,23.55,179.25,sad
there's no time to be shy I'm always asking my patients did you fart good morning okay because I want to hear that and that helps relieve that pressure so the biggest thing gasps pain,167.49,19.11,186.60000000000002,sad
it goes up to your chest and neck so I'm incisional pain but most people tolerate it pretty well thank you for listening to this oh wait I got a look at the prompt again sorry if I kept there's a,176.61,26.869999999999997,203.48000000000002,sad
