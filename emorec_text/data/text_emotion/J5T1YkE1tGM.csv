hi I'm dr. January Hill the very,12.98,4.15,17.130000000000003,sad
opportune general surgeon in Macon,15.69,3.33,19.02,sad
Georgia and today we're going to talk,17.13,4.11,21.24,sad
about recovery after bariatric surgery,19.02,5.88,24.9,sad
so that is another common question I,21.24,6.539,27.778999999999996,sad
hear about from patients number one,24.9,5.67,30.57,neutral
recovery time is a lot quicker than it,27.779,5.37,33.149,sad
was historically generally speaking you,30.57,4.649,35.219,sad
would have surgery in most people go,33.149,4.621,37.77,neutral
home 24 to 48 hours after their very,35.219,7.11,42.329,sad
Ettrick procedure we do a fast track as,37.77,6.15,43.92,sad
far as getting you up to walk,42.329,3.381,45.71,sad
immediately after surgery,43.92,5.49,49.410000000000004,sad
we also encourage drinking liquid diets,45.71,6.91,52.620000000000005,sad
so your surgeon wants you to be actively,49.41,7.11,56.519999999999996,sad
engaged in your activities after surgery,52.62,8.25,60.87,sad
and once we discharge you home we expect,56.52,6.9,63.42,sad
you to walk around most people can go,60.87,4.77,65.64,sad
back to work in two to three weeks,63.42,3.57,66.99,sad
some people take as long as six weeks,65.64,3.9,69.54,sad
depending on what kind of what type of,66.99,6.66,73.64999999999999,sad
job so your restrictions it might vary,69.54,6.39,75.93,sad
based on your career so if you're,73.65,4.109,77.759,sad
lifting if you're someone who loves,75.93,6.2,82.13000000000001,sad
heavy boxes or 50 or 60 pound crates,77.759,6.571,84.33,sad
probably keep you out for six weeks,82.13,4.33,86.46,sad
because generally speaking a lot of,84.33,5.81,90.14,sad
times the employers won't allow,86.46,7.71,94.16999999999999,sad
restrictions so it just it varies but we,90.14,7.36,97.5,sad
don't expect you to recover for surgery,94.17,5.64,99.81,sad
for next six months people actually feel,97.5,3.93,101.43,sad
better than expected it's pretty well,99.81,4.23,104.04,sad
tolerant these days and we can know that,101.43,4.829,106.259,sad
largely due to the fact that we do this,104.04,3.93,107.97000000000001,sad
minimally invasive or laparoscopically,106.259,5.07,111.32900000000001,sad
it's it's faster speedy speedy recovery,107.97,5.939,113.90899999999999,sad
time and less pain so people who want to,111.329,6.36,117.689,sad
get on about their lives one thing I,113.909,5.551,119.46000000000001,sad
will tell you there is some gas pain,117.689,4.47,122.15899999999999,sad
associated with bariatric surgery,119.46,5.339,124.79899999999999,sad
because the way we do the operation we,122.159,5.521,127.68,sad
do it using a laparoscope we make tiny,124.799,4.83,129.62900000000002,sad
little incisions you're down the wall,127.68,3.93,131.61,sad
and we pass trocars to,129.629,4.321,133.95,sad
instruments and we also put up a camera,131.61,3.96,135.57000000000002,sad
near your belly button well you could,133.95,4.56,138.51,sad
gasp looking a TV screen operator or for,135.57,4.56,140.13,sad
some people would play video games women,138.51,4.5,143.01,neutral
claim video games anyway with all that,140.13,5.52,145.65,neutral
gas we try to evacuate a lot of that gas,143.01,4.89,147.89999999999998,sad
however there's still something that's,145.65,4.53,150.18,sad
still trapped and your body has to expel,147.9,3.9,151.8,sad
in one of the ways you can get rid of,150.18,5.52,155.70000000000002,sad
that gas is to walk around okay no thing,151.8,5.46,157.26000000000002,sad
your search has been asking are you,155.7,6.0,161.7,sad
passing latest or okay so farting is,157.26,6.06,163.32,sad
really good after surgery that's going,161.7,3.12,164.82,sad
to help you feel better and expel the,163.32,4.17,167.48999999999998,sad
gas so that is great try to let loose,164.82,4.2,169.01999999999998,sad
there's no time to be shy I'm always,167.49,3.42,170.91,sad
asking my patients did you fart,169.02,3.78,172.8,happy
good morning okay because I want to hear,170.91,3.15,174.06,sad
that and that helps relieve that,172.8,3.81,176.61,sad
pressure so the biggest thing gasps pain,174.06,4.95,179.01,sad
it goes up to your chest and neck so I'm,176.61,4.379,180.989,sad
incisional pain but most people tolerate,179.01,5.55,184.56,sad
it pretty well thank you for listening,180.989,5.641,186.63,sad
