hi I'm dr. January Hill the very,12.98,4.15,17.130000000000003,happy
opportune general surgeon in Macon,15.69,3.33,19.02,happy
Georgia and today we're going to talk,17.13,4.11,21.24,happy
about recovery after bariatric surgery,19.02,5.88,24.9,happy
so that is another common question I,21.24,6.539,27.778999999999996,happy
hear about from patients number one,24.9,5.67,30.57,happy
recovery time is a lot quicker than it,27.779,5.37,33.149,happy
was historically generally speaking you,30.57,4.649,35.219,happy
would have surgery in most people go,33.149,4.621,37.77,happy
home 24 to 48 hours after their very,35.219,7.11,42.329,happy
Ettrick procedure we do a fast track as,37.77,6.15,43.92,happy
far as getting you up to walk,42.329,3.381,45.71,fear
immediately after surgery,43.92,5.49,49.410000000000004,happy
we also encourage drinking liquid diets,45.71,6.91,52.620000000000005,happy
so your surgeon wants you to be actively,49.41,7.11,56.519999999999996,happy
engaged in your activities after surgery,52.62,8.25,60.87,neutral
and once we discharge you home we expect,56.52,6.9,63.42,neutral
you to walk around most people can go,60.87,4.77,65.64,sad
back to work in two to three weeks,63.42,3.57,66.99,happy
some people take as long as six weeks,65.64,3.9,69.54,happy
depending on what kind of what type of,66.99,6.66,73.64999999999999,happy
job so your restrictions it might vary,69.54,6.39,75.93,sad
based on your career so if you're,73.65,4.109,77.759,sad
lifting if you're someone who loves,75.93,6.2,82.13000000000001,happy
heavy boxes or 50 or 60 pound crates,77.759,6.571,84.33,happy
probably keep you out for six weeks,82.13,4.33,86.46,happy
because generally speaking a lot of,84.33,5.81,90.14,happy
times the employers won't allow,86.46,7.71,94.16999999999999,happy
restrictions so it just it varies but we,90.14,7.36,97.5,happy
don't expect you to recover for surgery,94.17,5.64,99.81,happy
for next six months people actually feel,97.5,3.93,101.43,sad
better than expected it's pretty well,99.81,4.23,104.04,happy
tolerant these days and we can know that,101.43,4.829,106.259,happy
largely due to the fact that we do this,104.04,3.93,107.97000000000001,happy
minimally invasive or laparoscopically,106.259,5.07,111.32900000000001,happy
it's it's faster speedy speedy recovery,107.97,5.939,113.90899999999999,happy
time and less pain so people who want to,111.329,6.36,117.689,happy
get on about their lives one thing I,113.909,5.551,119.46000000000001,happy
will tell you there is some gas pain,117.689,4.47,122.15899999999999,sad
associated with bariatric surgery,119.46,5.339,124.79899999999999,sad
because the way we do the operation we,122.159,5.521,127.68,sad
do it using a laparoscope we make tiny,124.799,4.83,129.62900000000002,happy
little incisions you're down the wall,127.68,3.93,131.61,happy
and we pass trocars to,129.629,4.321,133.95,happy
instruments and we also put up a camera,131.61,3.96,135.57000000000002,happy
near your belly button well you could,133.95,4.56,138.51,sad
gasp looking a TV screen operator or for,135.57,4.56,140.13,happy
some people would play video games women,138.51,4.5,143.01,happy
claim video games anyway with all that,140.13,5.52,145.65,happy
gas we try to evacuate a lot of that gas,143.01,4.89,147.89999999999998,happy
however there's still something that's,145.65,4.53,150.18,happy
still trapped and your body has to expel,147.9,3.9,151.8,happy
in one of the ways you can get rid of,150.18,5.52,155.70000000000002,happy
that gas is to walk around okay no thing,151.8,5.46,157.26000000000002,happy
your search has been asking are you,155.7,6.0,161.7,happy

to help you feel better and expel the,163.32,4.17,167.48999999999998,sad
gas so that is great try to let loose,164.82,4.2,169.01999999999998,happy
there's no time to be shy I'm always,167.49,3.42,170.91,happy
asking my patients did you fart,169.02,3.78,172.8,happy
good morning okay because I want to hear,170.91,3.15,174.06,happy
