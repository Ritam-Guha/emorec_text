"Hey guys! I'm here in Mexico at the beach, and I thought
I would make a video about having an insulin pump at the beach because I found this week
to be very challenging having a pump on me. I thought I would give a little video to show
you what I'm doing to make things a bit easier. I think having an insulin pump on the beach
really sucks, and this is why...",13.12,21.79,34.91,NA
"So the first thing I find challenging is that
it's really hard to clip it to your bathing suit. Especially if you're a girl because there's
not much there to clip it to usually. You walk around with your pump site out, and
your pump showing, you get a lot of stares, you get a lot of people looking at you thinking
""oh, what's wrong with her? What kind of medical condition does she have?"".",34.91,19.71,54.62,NA
"Another thing is that if your pump isn't waterproof,
it's really hard if your going in and out of the water. Not to mention you have to protect it from
the sand. Lastly, it's really hot here. So, you have to protect your pump from the
heat because if your pump gets too hot, the",54.76,14.030000000000001,68.78999999999999,NA
"insulin will get too hot and it will stop
working. I'm going to go through how I deal with these
challenges of having an insulin pump on the beach. The first problem is with where to clip your
pump. I find when I buy my bathing suit, I like
to pick one that has a pretty sturdy strap at the bottom.",68.79,17.6,86.39000000000001,NA
"Nothing too stringy, or you'll clip your pump
to your bathing suit and your bathing suit will fall down! So I try to pick the bathing suit that I can
clip my pump to, and I know it will stay on without pulling the bottoms down. So another thing I find really annoying is
when your walking around with your pump here,",86.75,17.22,103.97,NA
"and you get a lot of stares, inquisitive looks,
like ""what is that? a heart monitor?"". Nobody really knows what it is. My advice is just don't care! I know it's easier said than done.",108.13,10.79,118.91999999999999,NA
"I've learned over the years to really embrace
the fact that I have type 1 diabetes and to not be shy about it. It's nobody's business really and just wear
it and flaunt it and don't be ashamed of it! What I do with my pump on the beach really
depends on what kind of activity I'm doing. If I'm just going for a walk down the beach,
I'll have my pump clipped to my bathing suit.",118.92,22.889,141.809,NA
"If I'm just sitting in my chair like this
on the beach, I'll put my pump in a protective case and then put it under my towel. If I'm going to go swimming, I disconnect
my pump, put it in this case, which is slightly insulated. It protects the pump from heating up a lot.",142.34,16.81,159.15,NA
"I will put it in my beach bag, and I make
sure to put my beach bag in the shade so that it doesn't get hot either. If I want to take a break from my pump, and
say take it off for about an hour, I'll check my blood sugar, make sure that my blood sugar
is a good number. Then I will give myself a bolus of what I
would normally receive from within an hour",159.15,20.679,179.829,NA
"from my basal rate, and then after an hour
of having my pump off, I check again to make sure that my blood sugar is still fine. And I'll either reconnect or stay disconnected. But it's all about keeping an eye on your
blood sugar while your pump is off to make sure it doesn't rise and giving yourself the
appropriate amount of insulin.",180.67,20.68,201.35,NA
"Okay, so the last thing I need to address
is keeping your pump cool because it's really hot here. I've been using this case. It's what I got with my pump. It's kind of insulating.",206.26,11.079999999999998,217.33999999999997,NA
"It makes it so that my pump doesn't get too
warm, but it definitely doesn't keep it cool. So I would suggest getting a FRIO case. You can get them online. I know a lot of people have these. It keeps your pump cool when you're at the
beach or in any hot climate.",217.66,15.405,233.065,happy
"I know I'll be purchasing one when I get home
because I think my pump has gotten too warm on the beach here in Mexico. One thing I haven't quite figured out yet
is how to do water sports with an insulin pump. Because my pump is not waterproof, so I can't
take it with me.",233.3,14.3,247.60000000000002,NA
"If any of you have ever done any sort of snorkelling
or kayaking, any sort of water sports, please let me know in the comments down below how
you have done that with an insulin pump. I would greatly appreciate it. So for my next insulin pump I'm definitely
going to get a waterproof one, just so it's easier to do any sort of water sport.",248.04,18.969,267.009,NA
"I feel like you also have to be less careful
with the waterproof insulin pump than with the one I have now. You're still able to have a good beach vacation
with type 1 diabetes. So if any of you are going on vacation soon,
I hope you find this helpful and you are able to enjoy your time at the beach!",267.06,15.852,282.912,NA
Thanks again for watching. Bye!,288.12,1.5,289.62,neutral
