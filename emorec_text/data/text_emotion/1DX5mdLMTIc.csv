all right everybody welcome back to the,0.0,4.23,4.23,fear
San Diego Miramar college EMT skills,2.19,3.899,6.089,fear
videos today we'll be talking about the,4.23,4.47,8.7,angry
blood glucose is an EMT skill you can,6.089,4.501,10.59,angry
perform in the County of San Diego so,8.7,4.17,12.87,
let's take a closer look okay so here we,10.59,4.65,15.24,
have our blood glucose many different,12.87,4.409,17.279,
brands there's many different types but,15.24,5.52,20.759999999999998,
they're all basically the same kit so,17.279,6.211,23.490000000000002,
you open it up here you've got your,20.76,5.55,26.310000000000002,
actual glucometer here you've got some,23.49,4.709,28.198999999999998,
test strips and then in this pocket,26.31,5.43,31.74,
you'll usually find some gauze to,28.199,7.051,35.25,
whiteboy blood a bandage to put over the,31.74,7.56,39.3,
finger after you are done alcohol prep,35.25,8.91,44.16,
pad this device is called a Lancet this,39.3,7.05,46.349999999999994,
is how you will obtain the blood sample,44.16,5.25,49.41,
and then depending on the brand or,46.35,5.27,51.620000000000005,
manufacturer you may have a couple,49.41,5.76,55.169999999999995,
calibrating fluids so we'll put all this,51.62,7.45,59.07,
off to the side here now the glucometer,55.17,6.77,61.94,
depending on which brand you have,59.07,5.19,64.26,
sometimes needs to be turned on by,61.94,4.12,66.06,
actually inserting the test strip that's,64.26,4.109,68.369,
the case with ours so you will take the,66.06,8.129,74.18900000000001,
test strip out of the container now on,68.369,8.881,77.25,
the test strip you will notice I don't,74.189,5.311,79.5,
know if you can see but you will notice,77.25,7.2,84.45,
these two black lines as opposed to this,79.5,8.46,87.96000000000001,
one white line the side with the two,84.45,5.97,90.42,
black lines is what gets inserted into,87.96,6.019,93.979,
the glucometer this is where you insert,90.42,6.39,96.81,
the test strip and it actually turns on,93.979,8.32,102.299,
the glucometer that code 69 corresponds,96.81,9.39,106.2,
with code on the side of the test strip,102.299,7.081,109.38000000000001,
can so now let's talk about how to,106.2,6.77,112.97,
actually obtain a sample from a patient,109.38,6.0,115.38,
okay so let's get started we've got all,112.97,4.21,117.17999999999999,
our equipment here we've got our,115.38,4.98,120.36,
mannequin that we are patient and keep,117.18,5.43,122.61000000000001,
in mind this skill is indicated anytime,120.36,5.189,125.549,
your patient has an alteration in Mental,122.61,5.64,128.25,
Status so we're going to start the skill,125.549,4.38,129.929,
obviously standard precautions scene,128.25,3.959,132.209,
safety the first thing you're going to,129.929,3.931,133.86,
do is assemble your equipment,132.209,3.481,135.69,
ready done that and then we're going to,133.86,4.89,138.75,
take our sterile alcohol prep pad out of,135.69,6.27,141.96,
the packaging sometimes patients do have,138.75,6.36,145.11,
a preference which finger you poke but,141.96,4.95,146.91,
you want to keep it to their,145.11,4.32,149.43,
non-dominant hand and on the side of the,146.91,5.57,152.48,
finger is ideal here so we're going to,149.43,6.27,155.70000000000002,
wipe the side of their finger with our,152.48,6.69,159.17,
sterile alcohol prep pad we'll take that,155.7,7.8,163.5,
throw that away now we want the alcohol,159.17,9.22,168.39,
to dry before we poke them with the,163.5,6.57,170.07,
Lancet and before we obtain the blood,168.39,3.81,172.2,
samples so while the alcohol is drying,170.07,7.35,177.42,
we can take our glucometer insert the,172.2,11.46,183.66,
test strip so that it turns on now that,177.42,9.06,186.48,
the alcohol has dried we will take our,183.66,5.1,188.76,
land set this particular brand of land,186.48,4.44,190.92,
set there's many different brands this,188.76,5.88,194.64,
one you turn the top until it is removed,190.92,7.4,198.32,
and then there's this lever here and,194.64,8.45,203.08999999999997,
with this side the side that you pulled,198.32,7.81,206.13,
the top part out of you're going to,203.09,5.649,208.739,
place that against the patient's finger,206.13,5.609,211.739,
and then on the count of three one two,208.739,7.831,216.57,
three you hear that click and you should,211.739,7.831,219.57,
see a drop of blood starting to form on,216.57,6.9,223.47,
the forefinger even though this is a,219.57,5.97,225.54,
safety needle you're going to have to,223.47,4.519,227.989,
throw this away into a sharps container,225.54,5.669,231.209,
like this one so we'll just toss that in,227.989,7.271,235.26,
there now this is a mannequin so it's,231.209,7.051,238.26,
not going to really bleed but the first,235.26,4.949,240.209,
drop of blood you need to wipe away,238.26,3.75,242.01,
because there's potential it is,240.209,5.101,245.31,
contaminated with the alcohol and could,242.01,6.539,248.54899999999998,
produce a false reading but once you,245.31,6.57,251.88,
have the first drop blood wiped away we,248.549,5.491,254.04000000000002,
can obtain the second drop you might,251.88,3.87,255.75,
have to squeeze their finger a little,254.04,8.36,262.4,
bit but once you get the drop of blood I,255.75,9.27,265.02,
want to show you guys that it's a little,262.4,3.82,266.21999999999997,
more,265.02,5.01,270.03,
but it's very important that you use the,266.22,7.55,273.77000000000004,
wicking effect of these test strips,270.03,6.78,276.80999999999995,
because if you were to just put the drop,273.77,6.49,280.26,
of blood say on the top of it right here,276.81,4.98,281.79,
you're not going to get the wicking,280.26,3.78,284.03999999999996,
effect and it's not going to read,281.79,4.95,286.74,
appropriately so our reading here we,284.04,5.31,289.35,
have 37 milligrams per deciliter,286.74,5.4,292.14,
so that would be hypoglycemic if this,289.35,5.97,295.32000000000005,
patient is able to swallow we can treat,292.14,6.18,298.32,
with oral glucose if not we need to,295.32,5.85,301.17,
activate ALS so they can come and start,298.32,5.49,303.81,
an IV now obviously this patient still,301.17,7.2,308.37,
has somewhat of an open wound here so,303.81,7.74,311.55,
we're going to take our bandage out of,308.37,10.44,318.81,
the packaging and place this onto our,311.55,10.4,321.95,
patient's finger,318.81,3.14,321.95,
obviously this wall go into the trash,328.519,6.52,335.039,
what you use to wipe the blood off with,331.879,7.78,339.659,
will go into biohazard and then same,335.039,7.05,342.089,
with the test strip you'll put it into,339.659,4.71,344.36899999999997,
the biohazard can and that is typically,342.089,5.87,347.959,
done by ejecting,344.369,3.59,347.959,
