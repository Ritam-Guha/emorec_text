diabetic retinopathy is a small vessel ischemic disease when the blood triggers are elevated it can affect the blood vessels anywhere in your body it can affect your heart your kidneys the nerve,4.45,18.969,23.419,angry
endings for the fingers and toes but it also affects the back of your eyes called the retina where it primarily affects the arteries and the veins what it does is that it causes a lack of,14.179,20.041,34.22,angry
blood circulation when the retina is robbed of its blood supply it gets distressed we found out one of the factors that is released in a distressed retina is called vascular endothelial,23.779,24.901000000000003,48.68000000000001,angry
growth factor also known as veg F when reg F is upregulated in a distressed eye it causes the existing blood vessels to leak blood and fluid and when a leaks blood and fluid in the strenght of the,35.87,22.74,58.61,angry
red and then we call that macular edema and that can lead to blurred vision it can also lead to a lack of blood circulation that can affect the peripheral retina and can make those,48.2,20.82,69.02000000000001,angry
existing blood vessels grow and when these blood vessels grow we call that neovascularization which means new blood vessels now these new blood vessels are very friable they can actually lead into,58.19,23.19,81.38,angry
the middle of your eye and patients can develop a shadow in their vision and we just known as a vitreous hemorrhage now these blood vessels also grow with a scaffolding of scar tissue and when this,70.25,22.049999999999997,92.3,angry
scar tissue grows into the vitreous it can contract and that can lead to the retina to be detached you call that attraction retinal attachment there are several forms of diabetic retinopathy,80.81,22.079,102.88900000000001,angry
there's the non-proliferation form and the proliferative form patients who start off with diabetic retinopathy may start with the mild form where we see microaneurysms and those are the out,92.12,21.901,114.021,angry
poaching's of the blood vessels sometimes these micro aneurysms can leak blood flew and that can cause some vision change now as diabetic retinopathy progresses it can lead to,103.28,21.479,124.759,angry
what's called moderate non-political diabetic retinopathy we often see more retinal hemorrhages in the periphery sometimes we see cotton-wool spots and hard exudates,113.75,19.651,133.401,angry
and as it gets even worse we may see severe non-political diabetic retinopathy the severe non-preferred diabetic retinopathy we see hemorrhages in all four quadrants of the retina the,123.11,25.02,148.13,angry
blood those can have some distortions we call that Venus beating as well as the development of inter retina micro vascular abnormalities these we call,136.73,25.65,162.38,angry
them Irma Irma can be the precursors of neovascularization and we see severe non-political diabetic nathi we get more concerned now the progression of diabetic neuropathy can get worse and,148.4,29.990000000000002,178.39000000000001,angry
when you have the mild form we estimated about a 6% chance of developing into the proliferative form within 12 months with moderate it's about 20 to 40 percent and with severe it can progress to,163.39,27.429999999999996,190.82,angry
proliferative diabetic neuropathy up to 60% of the time within 12 months so when it gets to proliferative diabetic retinopathy that's when we see the beginnings of neovascularization when,177.62,26.55,204.17000000000002,angry
the NIA valorisation occurs it can occur from the optic nerve the retinal vessels in the peripheral retina as well as the anterior parts of the eye like the iris and the angle those can bleed into the,190.79,25.83,216.62,angry
middle of your eye cause vitreous hemorrhage and traction detachments the complications when diabetes gets to its advanced stage or what we call proliferative diabetic retinopathy occur,204.17,22.980000000000004,227.14999999999998,fear
with neovascularization when the neovascularization occurs it can stem from the optic nerve the retinal vessels or the periphery and what can happen is these blood vessels can bleed into the,214.94,26.458,241.398,NA
middle of your eye and patients will develop a vitreous hemorrhage and show vision loss sometimes these blood vessels will grow scar tissue and as the scar tissue contracts it can lift the,228.799,22.832,251.631,NA
retina off and that leads to something called a traction retinal detachment patients can go blind from that in the front of the eye neovascularization can affect the iris and the angle if it,239.84,23.879,263.719,NA
affects the angle it can lead to pressure increases as these blood vessels block the plumbing system of the outflow of the eye all the conditions can lead to severe vision,251.54,21.341,272.881,NA
loss and blindness within the next few years if untreated,262.24,8.71,270.95,NA
