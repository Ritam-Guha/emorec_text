diabetic retinopathy is a small vessel,4.45,4.66,9.11,happy
ischemic disease when the blood triggers,6.859,3.811,10.67,happy
are elevated it can affect the blood,9.11,3.21,12.32,happy
vessels anywhere in your body it can,10.67,3.509,14.179,happy
affect your heart your kidneys the nerve,12.32,3.779,16.099,happy
endings for the fingers and toes but it,14.179,3.241,17.42,happy
also affects the back of your eyes,16.099,3.27,19.369,happy
called the retina where it primarily,17.42,4.38,21.8,happy
affects the arteries and the veins what,19.369,4.41,23.779,fear
it does is that it causes a lack of,21.8,4.74,26.54,fear
blood circulation when the retina is,23.779,4.741,28.52,fear
robbed of its blood supply it gets,26.54,4.469,31.009,happy
distressed we found out one of the,28.52,4.89,33.41,happy
factors that is released in a distressed,31.009,4.861,35.87,happy
retina is called vascular endothelial,33.41,5.94,39.349999999999994,fear
growth factor also known as veg F when,35.87,6.33,42.199999999999996,fear
reg F is upregulated in a distressed eye,39.35,5.1,44.45,fear
it causes the existing blood vessels to,42.2,4.95,47.150000000000006,fear
leak blood and fluid and when a leaks,44.45,3.75,48.2,fear
blood and fluid in the strenght of the,47.15,2.61,49.76,happy
red and then we call that macular edema,48.2,4.35,52.550000000000004,happy
and that can lead to blurred vision it,49.76,4.47,54.23,happy
can also lead to a lack of blood,52.55,3.75,56.3,happy
circulation that can affect the,54.23,3.96,58.19,happy
peripheral retina and can make those,56.3,4.29,60.589999999999996,fear
existing blood vessels grow and when,58.19,3.95,62.14,fear
these blood vessels grow we call that,60.59,4.109,64.699,fear
neovascularization which means new blood,62.14,5.17,67.31,fear
vessels now these new blood vessels are,64.699,5.551,70.25,fear
very friable they can actually lead into,67.31,4.41,71.72,fear
the middle of your eye and patients can,70.25,3.69,73.94,happy
develop a shadow in their vision and we,71.72,3.509,75.229,happy
just known as a vitreous hemorrhage,73.94,4.14,78.08,happy
now these blood vessels also grow with a,75.229,5.581,80.81,happy
scaffolding of scar tissue and when this,78.08,5.13,83.21,happy
scar tissue grows into the vitreous it,80.81,4.68,85.49000000000001,happy
can contract and that can lead to the,83.21,5.07,88.28,happy
retina to be detached you call that,85.49,4.559,90.04899999999999,happy
attraction retinal attachment there are,88.28,3.84,92.12,happy
several forms of diabetic retinopathy,90.049,3.93,93.97900000000001,happy
there's the non-proliferation form and,92.12,4.41,96.53,happy
the proliferative form patients who,93.979,4.921,98.9,happy
start off with diabetic retinopathy may,96.53,4.65,101.18,happy
start with the mild form where we see,98.9,4.38,103.28,happy
microaneurysms and those are the out,101.18,3.54,104.72000000000001,fear
poaching's of the blood vessels,103.28,3.78,107.06,happy
sometimes these micro aneurysms can leak,104.72,3.54,108.26,happy
blood flew and that can cause some,107.06,4.02,111.08,happy
vision change now as diabetic,108.26,5.49,113.75,fear
retinopathy progresses it can lead to,111.08,4.649,115.729,happy
what's called moderate non-political,113.75,4.68,118.43,happy
diabetic retinopathy we often see more,115.729,4.291,120.02,happy
retinal hemorrhages in the periphery,118.43,3.81,122.24000000000001,fear
sometimes we see cotton-wool spots and,120.02,3.09,123.11,fear
hard exudates,122.24,3.78,126.02,happy
and as it gets even worse we may see,123.11,5.159,128.269,happy
severe non-political diabetic,126.02,4.65,130.67,happy
retinopathy the severe non-preferred,128.269,5.55,133.81900000000002,happy
diabetic retinopathy we see hemorrhages,130.67,6.06,136.73,happy
in all four quadrants of the retina the,133.819,3.601,137.42,happy

concerned now the progression of,155.9,7.49,163.39000000000001,happy
diabetic neuropathy can get worse and,158.66,7.74,166.4,happy
when you have the mild form we estimated,163.39,5.59,168.98,happy
about a 6% chance of developing into the,166.4,5.7,172.1,happy
proliferative form within 12 months with,168.98,5.58,174.56,happy
moderate it's about 20 to 40 percent and,172.1,5.52,177.62,fear

proliferative diabetic neuropathy up to,177.62,6.36,183.98000000000002,fear
60% of the time within 12 months so when,179.6,5.49,185.09,fear
it gets to proliferative diabetic,183.98,3.509,187.48899999999998,happy
retinopathy that's when we see the,185.09,5.7,190.79,happy

these blood vessels can bleed into the,226.489,3.75,230.239,NA
middle of your eye and patients will,228.799,3.75,232.549,NA
develop a vitreous hemorrhage and show,230.239,4.981,235.22,NA
vision loss sometimes these blood,232.549,5.131,237.68,NA
vessels will grow scar tissue and as the,235.22,4.62,239.84,NA
scar tissue contracts it can lift the,237.68,4.35,242.03,NA
