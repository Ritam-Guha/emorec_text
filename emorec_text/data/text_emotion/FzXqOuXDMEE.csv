"In diabetes there are many types, but
the most commonly we talk about are Type 1 and Type 2. Though they have the same
name, they are very different. So, they're both insulin problems which are
characterized by high blood sugar. But in Type 1 diabetes, it is an autoimmune
disease, and so what that means is the body attack the cells that make insulin.
So, when the body attacks and destroys",0.0,24.029,24.029,angry
"those cells, the body then makes no more
insulin, meaning someone diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes would require insulin
injections to survive. Type 2 is a metabolic disorder. So, in this case
someone is making insulin, but their body's not using it. At least not using
it as effectively. OK, so there's many risk factors in Type 2 diabetes:
uncontrollable and controllable. Those",24.029,26.401,50.43,fear
"people with-- living with Type 2 diabetes
are-- may be doing just lifestyle management, may be doing lifestyle and
medication, meaning pills or injectables or maybe they even require insulin. The
symptoms are actually the same. However, in Type 1 diabetes, usually the
onset of those symptoms is very quick, whereas in Type 2 they may not have
symptoms for months, even years. Someone",50.43,24.6,75.03,angry

estimated 5 to 7 years without knowing it. But the symptoms: hungry, thirsty, tired,
angry and irritable, headaches. They're peeing more than usual. For someone
living with Type 2 diabetes, though, because the progression is slow or your
body acclimates to those symptoms so well, they can go unnoticed. Pre-diabetes
means that you are at risk for",75.03,27.299,102.32900000000001,angry
"developing Type 2 diabetes. So, at that
point what we do is we try to prevent the onset of Type 2 diabetes and that
diagnosis is based on lab values. There are the controllable risk factors, which
we often hear about the most, which is going to be our nutrition, our meal
planning, our lifestyle in terms of activity. Are we sedentary or not?
And then weight. Obesity is the number",102.329,27.221,129.54999999999998,angry

then there's the uncontrollable risk factors. Those include family history,
which is a big one. Family history, age, gender, ethnicity. The
higher risk groups are going to be Native American, African American,
Hispanic and Asian American. I can tell you, though, just being in this position I
have learned that diabetes does not",129.55,24.63,154.18,angry

adolescents and young adulthood. However, we are seeing more instances of
Type 2 diabetes in children. So, the biggest difference is they're growing.

difficult. They've got so much going on, whether that's activities, hormones,
just-- you know, maturing, growing. And that's probably the most difficult thing
and the biggest difference with pediatric patients. The number one
question that we probably hear is 'What do I eat?' That's probably number one. And
I would say that's a difficult question",179.32,24.450000000000003,203.76999999999998,fear

That's when I would say, you definitely should call us over at the Center for
Diabetes and Nutrition and schedule an appointment with one of our dietitians,
but the idea is that you can eat anything in moderation. We have to be
realistic and we have to be individualized. Everybody is different.",203.77,21.79,225.56,angry
