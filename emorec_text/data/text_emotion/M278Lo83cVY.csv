acromegaly is a relatively rare disorder,4.86,7.18,12.04,sad
of growth hormone excess coming from a,8.35,5.88,14.23,sad
pituitary tumor and when I said the,12.04,5.16,17.2,fear
relatively rare is we found out more,14.23,5.78,20.01,sad
recently that it's possibly that we,17.2,5.37,22.57,sad
under diagnosed acromegaly a SAS,20.01,5.439,25.449,sad
physician and overall from the large,22.57,4.89,27.46,sad
numbers of pituitary tumors there are,25.449,4.891,30.340000000000003,sad
several studies showing that acromegaly,27.46,5.309,32.769,sad
and also other type of pituitary tumors,30.34,5.13,35.47,sad
is more frequently than previously,32.769,6.181,38.949999999999996,sad
thought the issue with a growth hormone,35.47,5.88,41.35,sad
excess coming from the pituitary tumor,38.95,6.72,45.67,sad
is that it has devastating effects if,41.35,7.08,48.43,sad
it's long term in excess over a huge,45.67,8.88,54.550000000000004,sad
variety of signs and symptoms but also,48.43,8.519,56.949,sad
different organs so patients with,54.55,5.31,59.86,sad
acromegaly yes they will have eckerle,56.949,5.7,62.649,sad
changes everything will grow their face,59.86,4.41,64.27,sad
will change they will have frontal,62.649,3.75,66.399,sad
bossing they will have ring size shoes,64.27,5.25,69.52,sad
increased shoe size but they're slow so,66.399,5.341,71.74,sad
nobody will notice for years and years,69.52,6.029,75.54899999999999,sad
the min delay in diagnosis it's still 11,71.74,6.419,78.15899999999999,sad
years in us even now and it's pretty,75.549,6.061,81.61000000000001,sad
similar with what it was before on top,78.159,6.75,84.909,sad
of that these patients will have joint,81.61,5.88,87.49,sad
pain due to the destructions of the,84.909,4.951,89.86,sad
cartilage they will have increased risk,87.49,4.46,91.94999999999999,sad
of colonic polyp increased risk of,89.86,4.829,94.689,sad
thyroid enlargement they will have more,91.95,6.22,98.17,sad
diabetes than their counterparts at this,94.689,5.761,100.44999999999999,sad
age they have hypertension they have,98.17,5.28,103.45,sad
more obstructive sleep apnea so because,100.45,6.27,106.72,fear
of all these relatively nonspecific,103.45,6.209,109.659,sad
types of diseases patients have one or,106.72,5.48,112.2,sad
two more comorbidities and sometimes,109.659,5.0,114.659,sad
nobody is putting two and two together,112.2,6.18,118.38,sad
for years until they have really,114.659,7.051,121.71000000000001,neutral
prolonged growth hormone excess but also,118.38,5.919,124.29899999999999,fear
unfortunately this is associated with a,121.71,5.409,127.119,fear
large tumor so when the patients get,124.299,5.371,129.67000000000002,sad
diagnosed most of them already have a,127.119,5.041,132.16,sad
macro adenoma in a macro adenoma is a,129.67,4.709,134.379,NA
tumor that's more than we define it as,132.16,4.26,136.42,neutral
more than one centimeter but these,134.379,2.971,137.35,sad
patients sometimes are,136.42,2.91,139.32999999999998,sad
presenting with tumors that are two,137.35,4.26,141.60999999999999,sad
centimeter three centimeter and we're,139.33,4.8,144.13000000000002,sad
talking about the large size tumor when,141.61,4.83,146.44000000000003,sad
were looking at the normal size of the,144.13,4.41,148.54,sad
pituitary is the size of a pea so it's,146.44,4.29,150.73,fear
something that's pretty enlarged in the,148.54,5.16,153.7,fear
cellar area how we usually treat,150.73,6.21,156.94,fear
acromegaly first line of treatment for,153.7,5.1,158.79999999999998,sad
the large majority of patients per,156.94,5.34,162.28,sad
Endocrine Society guidelines is transfer,158.8,7.23,166.03,sad
noid or surgery the issue is most of,162.28,5.91,168.19,sad
these patients almost half of them if,166.03,4.35,170.38,sad
they already have a large tumor in LA in,168.19,4.68,172.87,neutral
the cavernous sinus area we know that,170.38,4.53,174.91,neutral
the surgeon is not going to be able to,172.87,5.01,177.88,sad
take that tumor out so then we need,174.91,5.75,180.66,sad
medical therapy we have right now,177.88,5.93,183.81,sad
several medical therapies approved and,180.66,5.89,186.54999999999998,sad
there are several groups the,183.81,5.59,189.4,sad
somatostatin receptor ligands are in,186.55,5.31,191.86,sad
most cases the first line of treatment,189.4,6.27,195.67000000000002,sad
and we have octreotide sub-q octreotide,191.86,7.38,199.24,neutral
lar learn real tight and more recently,195.67,7.08,202.75,fear
approved facility lar we're also using,199.24,6.45,205.69,sad
as a medication that targets the,202.75,4.91,207.66,sad
pituitary to decrease the growth hormone,205.69,4.92,210.60999999999999,sad
cabergoline it's not a preferred growth,207.66,4.72,212.38,sad
hormone but sometimes we're using,210.61,3.72,214.33,sad
especially in association with the other,212.38,5.58,217.96,sad
drugs for very mild disease I rarely use,214.33,5.72,220.05,sad
it as a unique treatment for acromegaly,217.96,5.52,223.48000000000002,sad
the other type of groups of drugs that,220.05,4.72,224.77,fear
we have available right now for,223.48,3.63,227.10999999999999,sad
acromegaly it's back this moment it's a,224.77,4.89,229.66,sad
blocker of the growth hormone and though,227.11,4.23,231.34,sad
it does not crease the growth hormone,229.66,4.59,234.25,sad
per sec should it's increasing it it,231.34,5.76,237.1,sad
decreases the igf-1 that's made in the,234.25,6.72,240.97,sad
liver but also it the IGF many of the,237.1,5.43,242.53,sad
effects of growth hormone excess are,240.97,4.37,245.34,sad
through the igf-1,242.53,2.81,245.34,sad
