"Is type 2 diabetes
a reversible disease?",0.317,3.772,4.0889999999999995,fear
"We are told that this is a chronic
and progressive disorder.",8.64,3.92,12.56,surprise
"That means that once you develop
type 2 diabetes,",12.56,3.44,16.0,surprise
"you're going to have it for life

"You're going to be on medications,
you're going to be on insulin",20.64,3.28,23.92,

the complications.",23.92,2.36,26.28,

amputations, heart attack,",26.28,4.6,30.880000000000003,
"strokes, kidney damage, dialysis...",30.88,3.08,33.96,angry
The whole works... it's inevitable.,33.96,2.48,36.44,
But is it really?,36.44,2.04,38.48,
"Imagine a world where type 2 diabetes
is a simple reversible disorder",38.48,7.04,45.519999999999996,
"where a simple dietary maneuver can reverse
your diabetes in a matter of weeks.",45.52,5.44,50.96,
"The American Diabetes Association
of course disagrees.",50.96,3.76,54.72,
"They say right on their website
that it's a fact",54.72,3.6,58.32,angry
"that for most people type 2 diabetes 
is a progressive disease.",58.32,5.32,63.64,angry
So you might as well forget about it.,63.64,2.64,66.28,angry
"Don't even try to get better, 
it's hopeless.",66.28,3.12,69.4,
They're telling you there's no hope.,69.4,2.96,72.36,
"But we can look
at certain examples",72.36,2.84,75.2,
"and we can see that this 
is actually not true at all.",75.2,4.16,79.36,neutral
"Let me give you some of these examples - 
bariatric surgery.",79.36,4.12,83.48,angry
"Bariatric surgery is also called
weight loss surgery or stomach stapling.",83.48,4.72,88.2,angry
"What they do is they take your stomach
and they cut it to the size of a walnut,",88.2,4.2,92.4,angry
so you really just can't eat.,92.4,1.88,94.28,fear
"Because you're not eating,
you're going to lose a lot of weight.",94.28,3.56,97.84,
"But what happens
to the diabetes?",97.84,2.64,100.48,
Well let's look at this study here.,100.48,2.8,103.28,
"In this study they randomized
two groups of people.",103.28,3.6,106.88,
"One group of people stayed
on their medications",106.88,3.16,110.03999999999999,
"and got the best medical therapy
available.",110.04,3.16,113.2,angry
"The other group got
weight loss surgery.",113.2,2.96,116.16,
"On the horizontal axis
is time over 12 months.",116.16,3.52,119.67999999999999,
"On the vertical axis is the number 
of medications that these people were taking.",119.68,4.36,124.04,
"You can see that the number
of medications that people took",124.04,3.32,127.36,
"while doing the best medical therapy
available, really didn't change.",127.36,4.72,132.08,
"They kept taking the same number
of medications,",132.08,2.6,134.68,angry
"they're really no better 
than they were when they started.",134.68,3.28,137.96,angry
Than they were at the end.,137.96,2.16,140.12,neutral
"But look at the weight loss
surgery group.",140.12,2.84,142.96,neutral
Very quickly within a matter of months,142.96,2.96,145.92000000000002,
"they're coming off all their medications
and it keeps going.",145.92,4.0,149.92,
"By 12 months many of these people
are off of all their medications",149.92,4.16,154.07999999999998,angry
"and their blood sugars
are completely normal.",154.08,3.56,157.64000000000001,
That's amazing!,157.64,2.12,159.76,
"Wasn't this a chronic
and progressive disorder?",159.76,2.72,162.48,
"Wasn't this a disorder
where there's no treatment",162.48,3.12,165.6,
"and there's nothing you can do,
it'll get worse?",165.6,2.4,168.0,
"Well not really,
not according to this study.",168.0,3.64,171.64,
"It looks like diabetes
is a disease that's reversible.",171.64,3.6,175.23999999999998,neutral
"But better than that,
it's quickly reversible.",175.24,3.52,178.76000000000002,angry
"And even other types of weight loss surgery,
such as gastric banding,",178.76,4.16,182.92,angry
have the same benefits.,182.92,1.96,184.88,
"Gastric banding is a procedure
where they put a belt inside your stomach",184.88,4.04,188.92,
and tighten it so you can't eat.,188.92,2.88,191.79999999999998,
And again what you see here,191.8,2.28,194.08,
"is that the diabetes very quickly reverses
and it stays gone.",194.08,4.4,198.48000000000002,
"So this is not a chronic and progressive
disorder, this is a reversible disorder.",198.48,4.96,203.44,
"I'm not saying that gastric banding or weight
loss surgery is the answer for everybody,",203.44,5.36,208.8,
"but it simply points to the fact
that the situation is different",208.8,4.48,213.28,
and this is a reversible disease.,213.28,2.64,215.92,angry
Let's look at another example.,215.92,2.12,218.04,
We can look at fasting.,218.04,2.24,220.28,
Fasting is a dietary maneuver,220.28,2.48,222.76,
"where you don't eat anything
for a certain period of time.",222.76,3.36,226.12,
"I had this patient here, Richard, 
who came to me for treatment of his diabetes.",226.12,5.04,231.16,
"He had been diabetic for 10 years, 
he was taking about 70 units of insulin",231.16,4.84,236.0,angry
and he was developing complications.,236.0,2.64,238.64,angry
"He was getting eye disease,
he was getting kidney disease.",238.64,3.68,242.32,angry
"So we changed his diet, 
we put him on a low carbohydrate diet",242.32,4.0,246.32,neutral
and we gave him some simple tips,246.32,2.12,248.44,neutral
"and we included some intermittent fasting
in his regimen.",248.44,3.48,251.92,
"Over a period of months
he lost about 50 pounds.",251.92,4.52,256.44,
And his diabetes got incredibly better.,256.44,3.6,260.04,
"We took him off all of his insulin,
we took him off all of his medications",260.04,4.28,264.32,
and his blood sugars are normal.,264.32,2.76,267.08,
"Even two years out now
he is still on no medications",267.08,3.4,270.47999999999996,neutral
"and his blood sugars
are doing amazing.",270.48,2.68,273.16,angry
"So in fact this is
a reversible disease.",273.16,4.52,277.68,angry
"Fasting seems to lead
to a reversal of his diabetes.",277.68,5.24,282.92,angry
And this is not a new finding.,282.92,2.64,285.56,angry
"In fact, if we go back almost 100 years,",285.56,4.08,289.64,angry
"Dr. Elliott Joslin, perhaps the most famous
diabetes specialists in history,",289.64,6.36,296.0,

medical journal...",296.0,3.4,299.4,

"after these two years 
of experience with fasting.""",307.287,3.5,310.787,neutral
"So what happened was that 
he had been using fasting for two years",310.794,3.966,314.76,neutral
"and he thought it was
so amazingly great",314.76,3.16,317.92,angry
"that it's going to be obvious,
everybody is going to know this.",317.92,3.24,321.16,angry
"There were a few problems
of course.",321.16,2.4,323.56,neutral
"At the time he didn't differentiate
between type 1 and type 2 diabetes.",323.56,4.32,327.88,
"Well, it's very beneficial for type 2 diabetes,
it really doesn't impact type 1 very much.",327.88,4.92,332.8,
"And with the discovery
of insulin a few years later",332.8,3.16,335.96000000000004,
all focus shifted to insulin,335.96,2.36,338.32,
"and everybody forgot 
about these dietary therapies.",338.32,3.36,341.68,
Recently in the United Kingdom,341.68,3.04,344.72,
"Dr. Taylor performed a study
called ""The counterpoint study""",344.72,3.6,348.32000000000005,

on very low calorie diets.",348.32,3.36,351.68,
"Well, it's not fasting,
it's very close.",351.68,2.8,354.48,
And look at these results.,354.48,2.2,356.68,
"In this group the blood sugars
went from 9.6 to 5.9 in seven days.",356.68,6.748,363.428,
Seven days!,364.16,1.836,365.99600000000004,

you'll always be on medication?,374.08,2.72,376.8,
It's simply not true.,376.8,2.32,379.12,

"We can look at the example
of very low carbohydrate
diets,",381.8,3.4,385.2,neutral
or so-called ketogenic diets.,385.2,2.44,387.64,angry
Let me give you a case -,387.64,2.0,389.64,angry
"I had a 27-year-old graduate student,
she was actually studying physiology",389.64,4.64,394.28,angry

on medications for the rest of her life.",415.8,4.64,420.44,angry

that she would follow a ketogenic diet.",420.44,5.44,425.88,angry

about 20 pounds",425.88,3.16,429.04,angry
