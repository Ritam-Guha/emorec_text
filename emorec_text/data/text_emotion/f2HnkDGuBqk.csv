Monday morning don't get worried nothing's gone wrong with the other show it'll be back I just wanted to try something a little bit different I've wondered how very sleepy I've often,19.59,11.82,31.41,sad
wondered how sweeteners artificial sweeteners real sweeteners affect my blood sugar so I've devised a little plan wherein every morning I'm going to get up and have a couple of cups of,31.41,10.98,42.39,NA
coffee just like I normally do and each morning I'm going to put in a different sugar or sugar substitute and then I'm going to use my handy-dandy yeah nothing to test my blood sugar and,42.39,15.119,57.509,sad
see how this goes so I can definitively know if erythritol does or does not spike my blood sugar or monk fruit or equal or sweet and low whatever they may be it's a little unnerving knowing that,58.289,12.210999999999999,70.5,NA
I'm going to start out my days for the next few days at least with something that could possibly spike my blood sugar but this is in the name of science so I'm kind of quietly speaking because the,70.5,12.479000000000001,82.979,sad
house is still asleep it's very early here as you can tell so um anyway I'm going to test my blood sugar this morning before I have any coffee and then today I'm not using any sweetener,82.979,11.64,94.619,sad
just do it like I normally do with heavy whipping cream just a tablespoon of that so will will test that to get a baseline of what my blood sugar does in the morning and we'll go from there,94.619,10.110000000000001,104.729,sad
all right guys whew it's amazing how terrible I look at a green light at 5:45 in the morning all right I'll meet you back here every morning it's a date bye guys,104.729,18.35,123.07900000000001,sad

so we're going to do some black coffee one day this week as well just to test that today is going to be a risk for tall so let me get a quick blood pressure me blood pressure blood sugar,154.54,10.889999999999999,165.42999999999998,sad
"reading for this morning because I need some coffee. Yeah, I'm sleepy. It's odd letting people see your bed-head and morning sleepy time face. All of these things are so fiddly and sharp that's a lot to",165.43,22.95,188.38,sad
"deal with in the morning, to be honest with you if you're diabetic this isn't fun I guess I'm not diabetic I just happen to have one of these that I wanted to test sugar with just for dietary reasons so",188.38,14.909999999999998,203.29,sad
hate that thing alright let's see what it is 96 this morning anyway I'm gonna bring some coffee bye guys okay good morning we're back again very sleepy this morning I ran out of test,203.29,18.53,221.82,sad

because I don't really need them for medical reasons obviously munch does it cover them so let's do this again today what are we going to have today Oh today is going to be Splenda which I'm scared,236.85,14.790000000000001,251.64,sad

family reunion I did pretty well I was actually kind of scared about that because as you can imagine a family reunion in the south involves tons of food but I did well anyway today I think,289.15,13.17,302.32,sad
I'm going to test a monk fruit the NuNaturals brand monk fruit a very dear friend of mine from college hi Elin we were chatting on Facebook and she told me the wonderful things about monk fruit,302.32,12.2,314.52,sad
"and I told her I was skeptical of it because I've heard so much about the ""In The Raw"" brand which obviously is mixed with dextrose and maltodextrin and I said I was scared of what's going to",314.52,13.270000000000001,327.78999999999996,sad
spike me and she told me of the new naturals brands which is supposedly only monk fruit in fact it comes in like a salt shaker situation where you shake it on your food because you have to use so,327.79,9.809999999999999,337.6,sad
little of it I think it says something like 1/64 of a teaspoon is equivalent to two teaspoons of sugar so this stuff is crazy strong so I'm going to try that today and see how it goes I'm filming,337.6,13.62,351.22,sad
I'll do just want me I guess I need to go hey guys guess what it's Monday morning again. Booo. I had a wonderful weekend I've had family in town for a big family,351.22,17.73,368.95000000000005,NA
reunion anyway I think today I'm going to do one of the sweeteners that I avoided last week and I don't really want to do and that's odd to say but it's sugar I'm just curious what it does,374.11,15.23,389.34000000000003,sad
but it's frustrating to know that you know everybody wants to start a diet on a Monday morning and here I will be um basically sabotaging that in some way all in the name of this whatever this,389.34,16.02,405.35999999999996,sad

having two cups of coffee my 7:30 but I'm only putting three yep tell my gluttony I actually have three but I'm only putting sweeteners in the first two which I'd am pretty quickly to,419.979,11.731,431.71,sad

would be a big lie to you and to me it tastes like magic so I want to sit out here and enjoy it and hope to god it doesn't screw me up for the rest of the day and cause me to crepe everything,461.77,11.759,473.529,sad
under the Sun I don't need that on a Monday we got to talk I used to don't do a video update after I drink my coffee I just take a photo of my blood sugar I don't know if you can,473.529,12.36,485.889,sad

"we're going to try a product that I really like and I have some suspicions that it probably does spike my blood sugar I'm not sure. Yikes, my shirt's coming off. Fiber Syrup. Let's try to get it in",600.529,13.8,614.329,NA
the light can you say that Fiber Syrup Gold this stuff is from Denmark and it claims to have per two tablespoons thirty total carbohydrates twenty-eight of which are fiber and two of which are,614.329,18.871000000000002,633.1999999999999,sad
sugars we're going to see if that's true this stuff is delicious that's the hope it doesn't spike me because I love this stuff as you see the bottle is almost all gone,633.2,11.67,644.87,sad
it tastes like pancake syrup and I joking is good so say no prayer for me that this doesn't spike my blood sugar because it's so good so I don't know how to sell we go in coffee I probably,644.87,14.19,659.0600000000001,sad
wouldn't put pancake syrup in my coffee but just for the purposes of this making everything equal in this test working out them I'm going to use it as coffee sweetener for today I'm following the,659.06,10.59,669.65,sad
same exact rules using the same average quantities of two teaspoons per cup alright so I'm going to record this we'll make a coffee and let's do this again oh my god I cannot use fiber syrup,669.65,14.04,683.6899999999999,sad
ever ever again this magic stuff that I was talking about how fantastic it was there's a reason that it's so fantastic a hundred and eighty-nine one serving size is two tablespoons of this I used,683.69,19.38,703.07,sad
four teaspoons two teaspoons in each cup of coffee that I had in the first two cups of coffee and my usual creamer I usually have a blood sugar rise of 10 or 15 points and that's probably from the,703.07,13.319999999999999,716.3900000000001,sad
creamer we're going to test that later in the week I'm gonna have to coffee without the cream probably tomorrow y'all 90 point 89 points my blood sugar shot up that was more than the sugar,716.39,10.920000000000002,727.31,sad
I used pure sugar 4 teaspoons of pure sugar and my blood sugar only went up to UM 147 it is at 189 gosh Sukrin Fiber Syrup Gold can't do it any more sugar booger,727.31,17.310000000000002,744.6199999999999,sad
Gonna have to throw you in the garbage damn stuff is good no it's pure sugar good morning guys um I do believe this is the last day of this little project we've been doing here together it's,744.62,17.429,762.049,sad

all of the major sweeteners so I believe I got them all so today is the last day I'm going to do coffee with no cream today just black coffee the same brand of coffee I've been using all week and,778.95,11.72,790.6700000000001,sad
well they're from there just to see how much the creamer actually has been affecting my sugars and then I'm going to compile all of this today or tomorrow I just want to reiterate and I'm,790.67,10.780000000000001,801.4499999999999,sad
probably going to say this in a better way but later when awake I'm not a doctor I am NOT diabetic I have not been trained on how to do any of this this is just a project for me a project for me,801.45,12.27,813.72,sad
to tell myself how these things have affected me and I had one little shock there as you know with that secret fiber gold what a disappointment and had I not done this how many days weeks months,813.72,11.429,825.149,sad
