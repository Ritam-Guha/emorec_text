Monday morning don't get worried,19.59,1.89,21.48,neutral
nothing's gone wrong with the other show,21.48,1.95,23.43,neutral
it'll be back I just wanted to try,23.43,2.22,25.65,neutral
something a little bit different I've,25.65,2.61,28.259999999999998,neutral

wondered how sweeteners artificial,31.41,2.73,34.14,neutral
sweeteners real sweeteners affect my,34.14,2.13,36.27,neutral
blood sugar so I've devised a little,36.27,2.49,38.760000000000005,neutral
plan wherein every morning I'm going to,38.76,2.25,41.01,neutral
get up and have a couple of cups of,41.01,1.38,42.39,neutral
coffee just like I normally do and each,42.39,2.22,44.61,neutral

sugar or sugar substitute and then I'm,45.69,4.56,50.25,neutral
going to use my handy-dandy,50.25,3.68,53.93,neutral
yeah nothing to test my blood sugar and,54.71,3.579,58.289,neutral
see how this goes so I can definitively,58.289,2.34,60.629000000000005,neutral
know if erythritol does or does not,60.629,2.52,63.149,neutral
spike my blood sugar or monk fruit or,63.149,2.241,65.39,neutral
equal or sweet and low whatever they may,65.39,2.38,67.77,neutral

I'm going to start out my days for the,70.5,1.68,72.18,neutral
next few days at least with something,72.18,3.119,75.299,neutral
that could possibly spike my blood sugar,75.299,1.921,77.22000000000001,neutral

actually kind of scared about that,291.73,2.13,293.86,neutral
because as you can imagine a family,293.86,1.65,295.51,neutral
reunion in the south involves tons of,295.51,3.21,298.71999999999997,neutral

"The Raw"" brand which obviously is mixed",319.75,4.05,323.8,neutral
with dextrose and maltodextrin and I,323.8,2.76,326.56,neutral

spike me and she told me of the new,327.79,2.04,329.83000000000004,sad
naturals brands which is supposedly only,329.83,1.59,331.41999999999996,neutral
monk fruit in fact it comes in like a,331.42,2.13,333.55,neutral
salt shaker situation where you shake it,333.55,2.37,335.92,neutral
on your food because you have to use so,335.92,1.68,337.6,neutral
little of it I think it says something,337.6,2.07,339.67,neutral
like 1/64 of a teaspoon is equivalent to,339.67,4.89,344.56,neutral
two teaspoons of sugar so this stuff is,344.56,2.31,346.87,neutral

it's sugar I'm just curious what it does,385.3,4.04,389.34000000000003,neutral
