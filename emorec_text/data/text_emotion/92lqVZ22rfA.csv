worst advice in fact i used to give this advice before i knew better because i was taught this way in school but it is bad advice so let's talk about why this is it has to do with,13.12,23.678,36.798,sad
what most people are missing in their database of knowledge about diabetes they might know that carbs will increase insulin but a lot of times they do not,25.039,21.921,46.96,sad
know that eating in general regardless of what you eat will trigger insulin doesn't matter what you eat every time you eat or a snack you spike insulin now what is,35.68,24.0,59.68,sad
a diabetic a diabetic is someone with too much insulin now yes if you're type 1 diabetic which you're completely burnt out you don't have any insulin i'm talking about the vast majority of,47.84,26.400000000000002,74.24000000000001,sad
people who are diabetic type 2 and they have too much insulin okay and so that's so what happens is they're insulin,61.12,20.321,81.441,sad
resistance so they have to take metformin and other types of medications to make the insulin connect more but if you check their fasting insulin level it's always really,71.84,20.159,91.999,sad
really really high okay now look at this meal one two three four five you spike insulin you spike you,81.759,15.841,97.6,sad
spike insulin it's gonna create way too much insulin you're never gonna ever fix diabetes you're gonna become a diabetic worse and worse if you keep doing this,89.28,20.798,110.078,sad
so here what do you do you basically we know to cut we need to cut down the frequency of meals this is not like starving the person this is not even cutting calories for cutting,101.119,22.560000000000002,123.679,angry
calories we want to decrease the meals why so we have more time in between the meals,112.159,16.560000000000002,128.719,NA
to keep insulin low when you don't eat insulin goes lower and you could heal insulin what you want to work up to if you're a pre-diabetic or diabetic is two meals a day,120.56,23.6,144.16,NA
ideally it's going to take a while to do that but it's the ideal scene if you want to improve your blood sugars okay,132.56,16.320999999999998,148.881,NA
so up to two males and then you have more time to heal now how do you do this how could you actually eat less and not be so darn hungry all the time well,140.72,19.357999999999997,160.078,NA

low-fat protein and vegetables that you have to add the fat in there to go longer i'll put some links down below but the other thing is that if you eat these small meals,158.4,21.520000000000003,179.92000000000002,sad
you're spiking insulin insulin comes in there lowers blood sugar okay guess what you're going to be hungry you're going to spike insulin again for the next meal it's going to lower blood,169.12,22.88,192.0,NA
sugar guess what you're going to crave crave carbs same thing happens over and over and over so if you can actually go longer keep,180.08,17.92,198.0,NA
insulin low you can heal a lot of issues especially maybe even not even become not even be a diabetic anymore okay so i put some links down below but,189.28,20.560000000000002,209.84,NA
