when Alex was first diagnosed with,0.089,5.311,5.4,neutral
diabetes type 1 diabetes we were utterly,2.1,5.88,7.98,neutral
numb we had heard of diabetes our whole,5.4,4.319,9.719000000000001,neutral
lives we had never associated it with,7.98,11.79,19.77,neutral
our family you will feel that there's,9.719,11.791,21.509999999999998,neutral
not a lot of people that understand your,19.77,4.169,23.939,neutral
situation and that's completely normal I,21.51,5.55,27.060000000000002,neutral
felt that way I think in our family what,23.939,6.151,30.09,neutral
happened was even though there's a lot,27.06,5.309,32.369,neutral
of information in the beginning or a,30.09,6.0,36.09,neutral
doctor was great very supportive she was,32.369,7.021,39.39,neutral
incredibly patient there was nothing,36.09,5.43,41.52,neutral
that she thought was a silly question,39.39,5.189,44.579,neutral
and there were times when I was like how,41.52,6.3,47.82,neutral
am I going to ask this question at 3:00,44.579,6.601,51.18,neutral
on a Saturday and yet they got back to,47.82,5.91,53.730000000000004,neutral
us and yet we were never meant to feel,51.18,6.3,57.48,neutral
silly and as more time went by those,53.73,7.29,61.019999999999996,neutral
silly questions became things we knew,57.48,5.969,63.449,neutral
things that we could handle and things,61.02,5.459,66.479,neutral
that became routine for us and normal,63.449,6.451,69.89999999999999,neutral
and it was really through their help and,66.479,6.481,72.96,neutral
their patience and their guidance that,69.9,6.539,76.43900000000001,neutral
it became somewhat normal for us and all,72.96,6.93,79.88999999999999,neutral
of a sudden a couple months in a year in,76.439,6.271,82.71,neutral
a year and a half in it's just part of,79.89,5.729,85.619,neutral
your day you get up you have coffee the,82.71,6.119,88.829,sad
Sun comes up you move on so I would say,85.619,6.93,92.549,neutral
that my daughter was diagnosed at 15 and,88.829,8.311,97.13999999999999,neutral
she's now 21 it becomes just part of who,92.549,6.78,99.32900000000001,neutral
they are and what they do and how they,97.14,5.549,102.68900000000001,fear
live and it does become normal the,99.329,6.511,105.83999999999999,fear
silver lining on this one is after that,102.689,6.811,109.5,sad
normalization happens there is a new,105.84,6.029,111.869,happy
perspective on absolutely everything in,109.5,6.54,116.04,NA
their lives and it can be really really,111.869,7.79,119.659,NA
a wonderful thing for them to kind of,116.04,7.35,123.39,NA
understand and they look at life a lot,119.659,5.441,125.10000000000001,NA
differently and I think that's been very,123.39,3.62,127.01,NA
helpful for our family,125.1,4.7,129.79999999999998,NA
is that if you can live with diet type,127.01,4.86,131.87,NA
one diabetes there's not much you can't,129.8,2.67,132.47,NA
do,131.87,2.76,134.63,NA
