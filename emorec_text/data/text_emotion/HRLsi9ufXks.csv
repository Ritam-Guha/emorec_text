not diabetes mellitus has been a big,1.159,7.36,8.519,
problem in recent times in Indiana and,4.29,7.26,11.55,
income us in particular and people come,8.519,6.78,15.299,
to us every every week to to be tested,11.55,7.83,19.380000000000003,
to know they're a very status and in,15.299,6.661,21.96,
some cases we faced with a problem to,19.38,5.78,25.16,
decide whether they are diabetic or not,21.96,5.55,27.51,
in those cases where there are,25.16,4.209,29.369,
borderline suspicion that they are,27.51,4.62,32.13,
diabetics we do what we call the oral,29.369,7.681,37.05,
tolerance test or GTT now the patient is,32.13,6.749,38.879000000000005,
made of fat overnight for at least a,37.05,5.099,42.149,
period of of 10 hours and then the,38.879,5.281,44.16,
patient comes to ass in the morning of,42.149,4.68,46.829,
the hospital some blood sample is taken,44.16,6.45,50.61,
at baseline to assess the person blood,46.829,7.291,54.120000000000005,
sugar and we prepare as tender glitters,50.61,8.16,58.769999999999996,
for the patient to taking what we expect,54.12,7.47,61.589999999999996,
if the patient is actually non-diabetic,58.77,6.81,65.58,
her face 30 minutes you expect the,61.59,5.75,67.34,
glucose load to rise,65.58,5.51,71.09,
4 to 1 are the glucose levels going up,67.34,6.43,73.77000000000001,
then ultimately are at the end of the,71.09,5.02,76.11,
two hours it comes down to normal,73.77,4.8,78.57,
indicating that a patient is not,76.11,5.06,81.17,
diabetic,78.57,2.6,81.16999999999999,
and during that period of glucose load,85.59,5.97,91.56,
there is a correspondent and concomitant,88.909,5.051,93.96000000000001,
release of insulin that controls the,91.56,5.099,96.659,
sugar level so that at the end of the,93.96,5.729,99.689,
two hours you expect that the equal rise,96.659,5.85,102.509,
of insulin will control the SS bleeker's,99.689,5.371,105.05999999999999,
and compare it to black rhodium factory,102.509,5.67,108.179,
and it comes back to the threshold which,105.06,6.299,111.35900000000001,
will be between three point six to six,108.179,7.14,115.319,
point four so in summary what we expect,111.359,6.3,117.65899999999999,
that if the patient is normal then after,115.319,4.47,119.789,
the glucose low challenge then the,117.659,4.561,122.22,
glucose level at the end of two hours,119.789,6.03,125.819,
will come between say three point five,122.22,7.98,130.2,
to six and not more because obviously,125.819,7.471,133.29,
they the insulin working perfectly would,130.2,5.52,135.72,
have converted the s gligar's so that,133.29,4.14,137.42999999999998,
the patient will have a normal glucose,135.72,4.099,139.819,
level,137.43,2.389,139.81900000000002,
