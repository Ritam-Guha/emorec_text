hey folks I just want to talk about the,4.91,4.75,9.66,sad
glycemic index real quick it's created,7.26,3.75,11.01,sad
by a nutritionist of researchers in the,9.66,2.49,12.15,sad
80s who are looking for a more accurate,11.01,3.6,14.61,sad
way to describe carbohydrates of,12.15,3.659,15.809000000000001,sad
different food groups rather than just,14.61,2.58,17.189999999999998,sad
comparing the total number of carbs,15.809,3.3,19.108999999999998,sad
which is generally considered to be,17.19,4.079,21.269000000000002,sad
inaccurate as far as how its impact on,19.109,5.58,24.689,sad
the human metabolism and so this,21.269,5.221,26.49,sad
glycemic index compares different,24.689,3.84,28.529,sad
carbohydrates and then the way that it,26.49,3.359,29.848999999999997,sad
evaluates them is based on how much it,28.529,3.691,32.22,NA
brings up your blood sugar so they'll,29.849,5.131,34.980000000000004,NA
take you know a tablespoon of sugar a,32.22,5.61,37.83,sad
piece of white bread a piece of grain,34.98,5.46,40.44,sad
bread a muffin whatever glass of milk,37.83,4.38,42.21,sad
and then they'll compare all of those,40.44,3.48,43.919999999999995,sad
based on how high they raise your blood,42.21,3.96,46.17,NA
sugar so how are the glycemic index the,43.92,3.42,47.34,NA
more increases your blood sugar that's,46.17,3.63,49.800000000000004,sad
pretty intuitive so in general you could,47.34,3.96,51.300000000000004,sad
say the lower the glycemic index the,49.8,2.76,52.559999999999995,sad
better generally there's three,51.3,4.29,55.589999999999996,sad
categories high medium and low things,52.56,4.95,57.510000000000005,sad
that are high or greater than 70 things,55.59,4.17,59.760000000000005,sad
that are lower less than 55 so again the,57.51,4.29,61.8,fear
lower the better and then the usefulness,59.76,4.08,63.839999999999996,sad
of this index is it sort of allows you,61.8,3.78,65.58,sad
to easily compare different types of,63.84,3.27,67.11,sad
carbohydrates regardless of whether,65.58,3.69,69.27,sad
they're simple or complex just sort of,67.11,4.499,71.609,sad
across-the-board standardizes them so,69.27,4.379,73.649,sad
there's there is some evidence to back,71.609,4.62,76.229,sad
up the use of the glycemic index there's,73.649,4.08,77.729,sad
strong evidence to suggest that diets,76.229,3.261,79.49,fear
rich in food with a high glycemic index,77.729,3.99,81.719,sad
are associated with an increased risk of,79.49,4.269,83.759,sad
diabetes as well as increased,81.719,3.51,85.229,sad
triglycerides and insulin resistance,83.759,4.61,88.369,sad
which is like sort of pre-diabetes,85.229,5.731,90.96,fear
also there's evidence that says that low,88.369,4.96,93.329,sad
glycemic index actually can reduce the,90.96,4.109,95.06899999999999,sad
risk of developing diabetes can reduce,93.329,4.021,97.35,sad
the risk of macular degeneration as well,95.069,5.37,100.43900000000001,sad
as coronary heart disease so it's,97.35,5.939,103.28899999999999,sad
definitely important to understand and,100.439,5.28,105.719,sad
it's a good way to compare carbs so one,103.289,4.32,107.60900000000001,sad
limitation of the glycemic index is that,105.719,3.121,108.83999999999999,sad
it does not account for the amount of,107.609,3.69,111.29899999999999,sad
carbohydrates consumed just the type so,108.84,5.61,114.45,sad
that's important to recognize and then,111.299,4.92,116.21900000000001,sad
it's utility and mixed meals and,114.45,3.869,118.319,sad
long-term studies are a couple of the,116.219,4.56,120.779,sad
factors that limit its utility so you,118.319,3.631,121.95,sad
don't always see people talk about the,120.779,2.971,123.75,sad
glycemic index and that's sort of,121.95,4.11,126.06,sad
why you may also hear about the glycemic,123.75,4.92,128.67,sad
load that's sort of the next the second,126.06,4.68,130.74,sad
generation glycemic index basically what,128.67,3.21,131.88,sad
that does it adjusts for both the,130.74,3.36,134.10000000000002,sad
quantity and the quality of the,131.88,3.3,135.18,sad
carbohydrates that you're going to,134.1,2.55,136.65,sad
consume whereas the guy stomach index,135.18,3.45,138.63,sad
only adjusts for quality it doesn't,136.65,5.19,141.84,sad
factor in the quantity the usefulness to,138.63,5.13,143.76,sad
physicians and population at large is,141.84,3.36,145.20000000000002,sad
sort of debated about the glycemic load,143.76,3.33,147.09,sad
but you can still use it to guide your,145.2,4.86,150.06,sad
food choices and then the rule for,147.09,4.83,151.92000000000002,sad
either of these which you'll see more,150.06,3.66,153.72,sad
often will be the glycemic index the,151.92,3.39,155.30999999999997,sad
rule for both them is simple the lower,153.72,3.66,157.38,sad
the better for sure so just keep that in,155.31,4.77,160.08,sad
mind lower glycemic index is better on a,157.38,4.41,161.79,sad
table on the left you see low glycemic,160.08,3.15,163.23000000000002,NA
index foods on the right you see high,161.79,4.23,166.01999999999998,NA
and so just to give you a sense there's,163.23,4.77,168.0,NA
obviously a lot more that could followed,166.02,3.27,169.29000000000002,NA
either these categories but you can take,168.0,2.4,170.4,NA
a chance here and look at some of these,169.29,4.08,173.37,NA
you know oatmeal pumpernickel sweet,170.4,4.44,174.84,NA
potatoes skim milk those are low,173.37,3.69,177.06,NA
glycemic index foods on the right side,174.84,4.02,178.86,NA
is the instant rice french fries soda,177.06,4.77,181.83,NA
crackers but mashed potatoes ice cream,178.86,4.26,183.12,NA
you know those things really drive your,181.83,2.25,184.08,NA
blood sugar up so those are high,183.12,2.82,185.94,NA
glycemic index foods so it's good to,184.08,3.24,187.32000000000002,NA
understand that and hopefully this was,185.94,3.41,189.35,NA
helpful,187.32,2.03,189.35,NA
