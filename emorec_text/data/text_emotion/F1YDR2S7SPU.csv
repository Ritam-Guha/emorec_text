hey folks I just want to talk about the glycemic index real quick it's created by a nutritionist of researchers in the 80s who are looking for a more accurate way to describe carbohydrates of,4.91,18.249,23.159,angry
different food groups rather than just comparing the total number of carbs which is generally considered to be inaccurate as far as how its impact on the human metabolism and so this,14.61,20.759999999999998,35.37,sad
glycemic index compares different carbohydrates and then the way that it evaluates them is based on how much it brings up your blood sugar so they'll take you know a tablespoon of sugar a,24.689,21.631,46.32,sad
piece of white bread a piece of grain bread a muffin whatever glass of milk and then they'll compare all of those based on how high they raise your blood sugar so how are the glycemic index the,34.98,20.700000000000003,55.68,sad
more increases your blood sugar that's pretty intuitive so in general you could say the lower the glycemic index the better generally there's three categories high medium and low things,46.17,19.59,65.76,sad
that are high or greater than 70 things that are lower less than 55 so again the lower the better and then the usefulness of this index is it sort of allows you to easily compare different types of,55.59,19.59,75.18,sad
carbohydrates regardless of whether they're simple or complex just sort of across-the-board standardizes them so there's there is some evidence to back up the use of the glycemic index there's,65.58,21.268,86.848,sad
strong evidence to suggest that diets rich in food with a high glycemic index are associated with an increased risk of diabetes as well as increased triglycerides and insulin resistance,76.229,19.64,95.869,sad
which is like sort of pre-diabetes also there's evidence that says that low glycemic index actually can reduce the risk of developing diabetes can reduce the risk of macular degeneration as well,85.229,24.191,109.42,sad
as coronary heart disease so it's definitely important to understand and it's a good way to compare carbs so one limitation of the glycemic index is that it does not account for the amount of,97.35,22.35,119.69999999999999,sad
carbohydrates consumed just the type so that's important to recognize and then it's utility and mixed meals and long-term studies are a couple of the factors that limit its utility so you,108.84,22.59,131.43,sad
don't always see people talk about the glycemic index and that's sort of why you may also hear about the glycemic load that's sort of the next the second generation glycemic index basically what,120.779,19.891000000000002,140.67,sad
that does it adjusts for both the quantity and the quality of the carbohydrates that you're going to consume whereas the guy stomach index only adjusts for quality it doesn't,130.74,17.85,148.59,sad
factor in the quantity the usefulness to physicians and population at large is sort of debated about the glycemic load but you can still use it to guide your food choices and then the rule for,138.63,21.509999999999998,160.14,sad
either of these which you'll see more often will be the glycemic index the rule for both them is simple the lower the better for sure so just keep that in mind lower glycemic index is better on a,150.06,19.89,169.95,sad
table on the left you see low glycemic index foods on the right you see high and so just to give you a sense there's obviously a lot more that could followed either these categories but you can take,160.08,17.82,177.9,NA
a chance here and look at some of these you know oatmeal pumpernickel sweet potatoes skim milk those are low glycemic index foods on the right side is the instant rice french fries soda,169.29,20.999999999999996,190.29,NA
crackers but mashed potatoes ice cream you know those things really drive your blood sugar up so those are high glycemic index foods so it's good to understand that and hopefully this was,178.86,15.98,194.84,NA
