hey everyone died like Danica and I'm in the bathroom and the reason I am is because today's video is about showering with the insulin pump I've gotten a couple questions recently about what I,0.06,27.841,27.901,angry
do when I shower with my pump and so I thought I would answer that big video now I have the Animus pump and this one is waterproof actually but I still think it all for showering because my big,14.73,27.269000000000005,41.99900000000001,angry
thing is where would I put it no pockets in the shower although I guess there are those little like shell things but I feel like they were just like I feel like it would fall I would just swipe it,26.49,24.930999999999997,51.42099999999999,sad
off and it would be bad so I don't wear it in the shower if you don't know with pumps you can literally just unclip them whenever you want without taking out actual sets so I just unclipped it right,40.5,21.78,62.28,angry
now and my set is filling but it's unclipped and so I do that before I go in the shower but first I actually do give a little bit of insulin before I go in the shower so if I was going to take,51.12,23.819000000000003,74.939,angry
a shower right now I would go ahead and look at my basal and if you can see its point seven-five right now and I generally take about 20 minutes take a shower from the time I,64.14,20.28,84.42,angry
take off my pumps but kind of get in the shower come out dry out all that good stuff and so I figure that's about half of my basal rate to the hour and then is round down because it's not quite a half,73.89,20.820999999999998,94.711,angry
hour so for 0.75 an hour I would probably bolus about 0.3 or 0.35 and then I would go ahead after Bowl listen I would unclip it and what I like to do is I,84.93,24.59,109.52000000000001,angry
just wrap the tubing around the pump and kind of tuck this in here just put all nice and cozy you can suspend your pump actually so that no in finish push through but it's such a short amount of,96.24,24.309,120.54899999999999,sad
time that I'm just like forget it I don't want to vibrating in my room for the whole time in the shower that would be really annoying especially in the morning my roommates are sleeping so I'm,108.479,18.211,126.69,sad
just like you know what just leave it on and then when I come back out of the shower I try to reconnect as soon as possible sometimes I forget and I end up like doing my hair my makeup and I like,117.45,20.249000000000002,137.699,angry
don't have it plugged in and I'm like shoot but try to put it in as fast as possible speaking out of I should put this back right now actually used to not bullets,127.68,23.061,150.741,angry
at all when I took a shower because it was just so short but I feel like it's a good thing to do because I have noticed sometimes I do go high after showering but it's my blood Sugar's on the lower,139.54,19.86,159.39999999999998,angry
side before I shower then sometimes I'll just skip it to the mic well I don't really want a bolus hop in the shower and then go low so if I'm on the lower side after gets a bolus there actually,149.23,20.1,169.32999999999998,sad
are these little shower places the sets come with if you can see that but I actually don't use these for showering just because showers are very clean nothing really gets in there if I do go,159.4,21.089000000000002,180.489,sad
swimming in a lake or the ocean I do use these but yeah that's what those are so that is all I do to shower with an insulin pump if you liked this video give it a thumbs up don't forget to,169.45,21.330000000000002,190.78,NA
