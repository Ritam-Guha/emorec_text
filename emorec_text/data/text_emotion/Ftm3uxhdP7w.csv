hi my name is tessa pierce ward,0.32,5.28,5.6000000000000005,fear
and i'd like to talk to you today about,3.76,4.48,8.24,fear
sour mesh protein camera sketches for,5.6,4.88,10.48,surprise
large scents,8.24,3.92,12.16,surprise
sour mesh is a command line and python,10.48,4.48,14.96,fear
library for skilled men hash analyses,12.16,4.0,16.16,fear
minhash methods have been around for a,14.96,2.88,17.84,fear
little while and they compress data sets,16.16,4.4,20.560000000000002,fear
into sketches composed of representative,17.84,6.32,24.16,fear
subset of their cameras um,20.56,6.959,27.519,
and uh we we know that long dna cameras,24.16,4.879,29.039,
uh camera sketches can be used for,27.519,3.68,31.198999999999998,fear
distance estimation between samples so,29.039,4.401,33.44,fear
we if we have a genome and genome b then,31.199,3.921,35.120000000000005,fear
the sketch is here,33.44,3.76,37.199999999999996,fear
we can compute the jaccard index the,35.12,4.0,39.12,fear
intersection over the union of those,37.2,4.96,42.160000000000004,fear
sketches and as was published in in 2015,39.12,5.84,44.959999999999994,fear
2016 um the jaccard has a relationship,42.16,5.68,47.839999999999996,fear
to nuclear average nucleotide identity,44.96,5.2,50.160000000000004,fear
so we can get an estimate there,47.84,4.08,51.92,happy
sarah mesh actually uses a minhash,50.16,3.6,53.76,happy
variant scaled min hash,51.92,4.0,55.92,fear
which enables us to do both containment,53.76,4.08,57.839999999999996,fear
as well as jakarta index and in,55.92,3.52,59.440000000000005,fear
particular this enables comparisons,57.84,5.68,63.52,fear
between sets of different sizes,59.44,5.759,65.199,fear
the majority of minhash methods have,63.52,5.04,68.56,fear
focused on dna k-mers um which are most,65.199,5.041,70.24,fear
useful for differentiating between,68.56,4.08,72.64,fear
closely related sequences if we have a,70.24,6.08,76.32,fear
couple uh example 21 mirrors with two uh,72.64,5.2,77.84,neutral
base pair differences,76.32,3.92,80.24,fear
in in many cases they are synonymous,77.84,4.48,82.32000000000001,fear
substitutions that uh end up as the same,80.24,4.72,84.96,fear
amino acid and in this example uh these,82.32,4.4,86.72,happy
two protein submers are exactly,84.96,3.44,88.39999999999999,neutral
identical,86.72,3.52,90.24,fear
so this is um this is just to illustrate,88.4,3.52,91.92,fear
that protein sequences allow matching,90.24,3.519,93.759,fear
across anonymous substitution and of,91.92,3.36,95.28,fear
course we know this uh we've been using,93.759,3.521,97.28,fear
it for you know blast x uh protein blast,95.28,4.159,99.43900000000001,happy
for quite a long time and actually,97.28,4.08,101.36,happy
match screen is the first example of,99.439,4.0,103.439,neutral
using uh protein k-mers for some,101.36,4.079,105.439,fear
identification,103.439,4.081,107.52,fear
we've been lately pursuing some other,105.439,4.081,109.52,fear
protein applications in particular we're,107.52,4.4,111.92,happy
exploring taxonomic classification,109.52,4.0,113.52,neutral
there's some challenges in this realm uh,111.92,4.239,116.159,neutral
reference databases are often incomplete,113.52,5.04,118.56,fear
uh highly divergent genomes sometimes,116.159,4.96,121.119,fear
cannot be classified or incomplete and,118.56,4.4,122.96000000000001,fear
contaminated genomes can can be,121.119,4.161,125.28,fear
misclassified and of course our goal is,122.96,4.88,127.83999999999999,fear
to enable real-time classification to,125.28,5.199,130.479,fear
keep up with the scale of incoming data,127.84,4.399,132.239,fear
so we've built a snake make workflow on,130.479,3.681,134.16000000000003,happy
top of star mesh,132.239,3.761,136.0,fear
that allows us to string a few commands,134.16,4.64,138.79999999999998,fear
together to do this,136.0,4.72,140.72,fear
so our first step is to use cymesh,138.8,3.84,142.64000000000001,fear
gather which is a greedy mintset cub,140.72,5.12,145.84,fear
algorithm to find the best genome match,142.64,3.92,146.55999999999997,neutral
so,145.84,2.0,147.84,neutral
to illustrate what this does we have a,146.56,3.28,149.84,neutral
novel genome with some strain variation,147.84,3.44,151.28,neutral
in there,149.84,2.64,152.48,neutral
we can pick out the best reference,151.28,2.959,154.239,fear
genome here in flu,152.48,2.8,155.28,fear
and and here i'm just kind of,154.239,3.921,158.16,fear
representing these these two jams are uh,155.28,5.28,160.56,fear
different genuses but the same species,158.16,3.84,162.0,fear
um so they they're a little bit,160.56,2.959,163.519,fear
different there,162.0,3.92,165.92,fear
so we're able to get 60 match to to the,163.519,3.921,167.44,fear
blue genome and we can find an,165.92,3.679,169.599,fear
additional maybe 25 match to the other,167.44,3.04,170.48,fear
one,169.599,3.601,173.2,fear
and of course some is unmatched,170.48,4.64,175.11999999999998,fear
what we can do then um with the tax,173.2,4.399,177.599,fear
genome command is take the uh reference,175.12,4.24,179.36,neutral
taxonomic lineages assigned to each of,177.599,4.801,182.39999999999998,fear
those best or matching reference genomes,179.36,5.519,184.87900000000002,fear
and we can uh transfer them on to the,182.4,4.96,187.36,fear
match percentages for our novel genome,184.879,4.561,189.44,neutral
so in this case we're getting 60 to that,187.36,4.959,192.31900000000002,fear
species a and 25 to that that other,189.44,4.96,194.4,fear
reference genome species b,192.319,3.761,196.07999999999998,neutral
but because these are non-overlapping,194.4,5.36,199.76000000000002,fear
matched regions or match percentages we,196.08,5.76,201.84,fear
can actually sum that to get um the,199.76,4.24,204.0,fear
percent match at the lowest uh the least,201.84,4.88,206.72,fear
common ancestor for these two so in in,204.0,6.0,210.0,neutral
this case genus x has an 85 match,206.72,6.0,212.72,neutral
so what we're using this for then is,210.0,5.68,215.68,fear
choosing a a percentage or a threshold,212.72,4.96,217.68,fear
for when we consider sufficient query,215.68,4.72,220.4,fear
match and we can assign um that,217.68,4.4,222.08,fear
classification that we get to to our,220.4,3.759,224.159,happy
novel genome,222.08,3.12,225.20000000000002,sad
okay,224.159,3.841,228.0,neutral
so how well does this work uh we decided,225.2,7.36,232.56,neutral
to do first a comparison with um gtd btk,228.0,6.959,234.959,fear
uh and we started out with a benchmark,232.56,5.0,237.56,fear
set of a thousand human gut uh,234.959,6.881,241.84,fear
metagenome genomes uh for magnify and uh,237.56,6.2,243.76,fear
and these are all likely to have similar,241.84,5.36,247.20000000000002,fear
genomes available in reference databases,243.76,4.479,248.239,neutral
we,247.2,3.52,250.72,neutral
got exact we found exact lineage matches,248.239,5.441,253.68,neutral
for about 95 when using the full gcb,250.72,4.239,254.959,neutral
recent release,253.68,4.079,257.759,neutral
and the additional around four percent,254.959,4.881,259.84000000000003,neutral
of it actually all matched at the genus,257.759,3.6,261.35900000000004,neutral
level so,259.84,3.6,263.44,neutral
so this is we think it's pretty doing,261.359,3.441,264.79999999999995,neutral
pretty well even though we're using,263.44,3.039,266.479,neutral
currently a very naive classification,264.8,3.679,268.479,neutral
threshold of 10 of the query and we need,266.479,2.801,269.28,neutral
to,268.479,3.361,271.84,neutral
look into this a little bit further,269.28,5.199,274.479,fear
extending this to um an environmental,271.84,5.52,277.35999999999996,fear
set of samples we took 885 genomes from,274.479,5.361,279.84,fear
uh from the tara oceans from the delmont,277.36,4.96,282.32,fear
paper um i think neither of them really,279.84,3.68,283.52,happy
classified all of them but they got,282.32,2.56,284.88,NA
pretty close,283.52,3.28,286.79999999999995,NA
and here we had exact matches at about,284.88,3.039,287.919,NA
66,286.8,3.119,289.91900000000004,NA
and some match at a higher lineage rank,287.919,4.0,291.919,NA
at 33,289.919,3.84,293.75899999999996,NA
and if we break those down most of those,291.919,3.361,295.28,NA
lineage matches happen at the genus,293.759,2.72,296.47900000000004,NA
level so we,295.28,3.359,298.63899999999995,NA
got the exact same genius level,296.479,4.56,301.039,NA
uh classification but uh a different,298.639,5.84,304.479,NA
species was selected as the as the uh,301.039,5.521,306.56,NA
exact classification so we need to look,304.479,4.56,309.039,NA
into those differences there uh but it's,306.56,5.12,311.68,NA
promising uh because this is a really,309.039,4.88,313.919,NA
lightweight whole camera or whole,311.68,4.56,316.24,NA
protium camera based classification,313.919,4.081,318.0,NA
which means it's likely going to be a,316.24,4.32,320.56,NA
little more uh robust to incomplete and,318.0,4.88,322.88,NA
contaminated genomes and then of course,320.56,3.76,324.32,NA
because it's camera-based it offers near,322.88,3.039,325.919,NA
real-time classification and with that,324.32,2.64,326.96,NA
i'd like to thank you so much for,325.919,3.041,328.96,NA
listening um and please do find us on,326.96,4.88,331.84,NA
