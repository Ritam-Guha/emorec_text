pharmacist and today we'll be talking,8.43,6.66,15.09,fear
about mixing insolence before injecting,9.9,7.16,17.060000000000002,fear
your insulin you want to make sure that,15.09,4.65,19.740000000000002,sad
the clear insulin doesn't have any,17.06,5.529,22.589,fear
particulates in it and also check the,19.74,6.539,26.278999999999996,fear
expiration date and you want to make,22.589,5.16,27.749,fear
sure that the cloudy insulin doesn't,26.279,3.361,29.64,sad
have anything settled at the bottom and,27.749,4.861,32.61,sad
check the expiration date if you notice,29.64,4.32,33.96,sad
that things have settled at the bottom,32.61,4.41,37.019999999999996,fear
of your cloudy insolent roll the insulin,33.96,6.149,40.109,fear
back and forth in your hands for 15 to,37.02,6.48,43.5,fear
30 seconds it's important that you never,40.109,9.871,49.980000000000004,fear
shake insulin after you've rolled the,43.5,9.96,53.46,fear
insulin check again for anything,49.98,5.309,55.288999999999994,fear
settling and if it's all gone then,53.46,6.54,60.0,fear
you're all set take your syringe and,55.289,8.241,63.53,fear
remove the cap from the needle,60.0,3.53,63.53,fear
at this point it's important to know,69.65,4.29,73.94000000000001,fear
what your dose is of each of the,71.75,5.94,77.69,fear
insolence in this case I will be drawing,73.94,7.05,80.99,sad
up 20 units of the cloudy at 10 units of,77.69,7.5,85.19,fear
the clear insulin so first I'm going to,80.99,7.92,88.91,fear
put 20 units of air into the cloudy,85.19,6.27,91.46,sad
insulin without letting the needle touch,88.91,5.4,94.31,sad
the insulin so I'm going to draw my,91.46,6.48,97.94,sad
plunger back to 20 I'm going to stick,94.31,7.23,101.54,sad
the needle into the cloudy insulin again,97.94,6.99,104.92999999999999,sad
without turning it over I'm going to,101.54,6.93,108.47,sad
inject the air into the vial and then,104.93,6.81,111.74000000000001,sad
I'm going to pull the syringe out again,108.47,7.41,115.88,sad
without touching the insulin I'm then,111.74,6.75,118.49,sad
going to pull the plunger again back but,115.88,6.989,122.869,sad
this time I'm going it to 10 we're going,118.49,9.06,127.55,sad
to inject that 10 minutes of air into my,122.869,10.59,133.459,sad
clear insulin I'm going to turn the,127.55,8.88,136.43,sad
whole thing over and I'm going to,133.459,7.821,141.28,sad
withdraw 10 units got clear n slide on,136.43,7.86,144.29000000000002,sad
this one if you have bubbles you can,141.28,5.14,146.42,sad
pull back a little bit farther and then,144.29,7.83,152.12,sad
push the bubbles out but make sure you,146.42,8.76,155.17999999999998,sad
don't do that in the next step and turn,152.12,7.74,159.86,sad
