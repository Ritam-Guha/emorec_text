"Hemoglobin a1c, or glycosylated hemoglobin, is a term for glycated hemoglobin. The amount of candied hemoglobin is an important indicator for us in the follow-up of individuals with diabetes. As you all know, blood cells, erythrocytes, which carry oxygen to our tissues, carry oxygen with hemoglobin. If a person with diabetes has a high blood sugar level, this hemoglobin is sugared at a much higher rate, and this erythrocyte continues to circulate as sugar throughout its lifetime, 90 days.",0.0,32.146,32.146,angry
"By measuring the amount of sugary erythrocytes and hemoglobin in the blood, we get an idea about the blood sugar of the person with diabetes.  Hemoglobin a1c values ​​are high in diabetics with impaired blood sugar control, and close to those of normal individuals in diabetics with normal blood sugar control. Hemoglobin a1c values ​​are lower than 5.7 in healthy individuals. Hemoglobin a1c rate is between 5.7% and 6.5% in people who are prone to diabetes, that is, in people called prediabetic. Individuals with diabetes have hemoglobin a1c values ​​above 6.5%. If a person's hemoglobin a1c is 6.5% or more, that person can be classified as having diabetes.",32.807,46.897,79.70400000000001,angry
"In our country and all over the world, hemoglobin a1c has recently become a parameter used in the diagnosis of diabetes. Although reimbursement agencies do not use hemoglobin a1c as a screening test, hemoglobin a1c was measured  incidentally in people whose hemoglobin a1c was measured. In people who are not known to have diabetes, if the figure is 6.5 or more, it is very important to confirm that they have diabetes with other tests and to make an evaluation about it. It is an important laboratory indicator that helps us for early diagnosis and guides the follow-up of individuals with diabetes.",81.148,33.141000000000005,114.289,angry
