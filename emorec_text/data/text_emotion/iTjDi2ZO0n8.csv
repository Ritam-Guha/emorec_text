"Hey, Dr. Berg here.",1.849,1.0,2.849,sad
I'm going to talk about insulin resistance.,2.849,2.041,4.890000000000001,sad
"I'm going to make it really, really simple,
so just track with me.",4.89,4.09,8.98,sad
Here's what happens.,8.98,1.71,10.690000000000001,sad
"Your pancreas, which is located in the left,
lower quadrant, right by your rib cage, makes",10.69,7.51,18.2,sad
"a hormone called insulin and insulin responds
to sugar.",18.2,5.91,24.11,sad
"In other words it's triggered by a sugar or
anything that turns into sugar, so anything",24.11,4.63,28.74,sad
"sweet and anything, like even refined grains
can trigger insulin, and it kicks in there",28.74,6.15,34.89,sad
and it goes into your cells.,34.89,1.65,36.54,sad
"Then, what it does is it removes the sugar
from your blood, so that's the purpose is",36.54,5.64,42.18,sad
to lower the sugar.,42.18,2.67,44.85,sad
"Normally, in our blood, we need about 100
milligrams per deciliter, and basically what",44.85,6.419,51.269,sad
"that means is you can just take and focus
on the 100, so when you get your sugar test",51.269,4.38,55.649,sad
and your blood should be like a 100.,55.649,1.49,57.139,sad
The goal is to make it 100.,57.139,1.711,58.85,sad
Anything higher is bad.,58.85,1.86,60.71,sad
Anything lower is bad.,60.71,1.0,61.71,sad
We need a 100.,61.71,1.079,62.789,sad
"When it's at 100, you're at your mental best.",62.789,3.171,65.96000000000001,sad
"You're feeling the best but when it goes high,
you get what's called diabetes, so diabetes",65.96,4.8,70.75999999999999,sad
is the high sugar situation.,70.76,2.42,73.18,sad
"When the blood sugars go low, that's hypo-sugar
or hypoglycemia, okay.",73.18,5.579,78.759,sad
That's kind of a pre-diabetes state.,78.759,3.781,82.54,sad
"When I was twelve, I had hypoglycemia.",82.54,3.03,85.57000000000001,sad
"I remember skipping a meal and feeling really
dizzy and irritable and cranky, playing outside",85.57,6.38,91.94999999999999,sad
"and I don't know what it was but, of course,
I was living on pure sugar.",91.95,4.11,96.06,sad
"I would raid the cupboards and eat pure sugar
all the time.",96.06,4.229,100.289,sad
"That's really what causes hypoglycemia because
what happens is you eat all this sugar and",100.289,5.421,105.71000000000001,sad
"we get this hyper reactive, high insulin state,
which is going to like take a sledge hammer",105.71,6.589,112.29899999999999,sad
"and push that sugar right down, so we're going
to have low sugar, irritable, cranky, craving,",112.299,6.451,118.75,sad
"dizzy, all those things.",118.75,1.469,120.219,sad
"Now what happens over a period of time, when
you're hypoglycemic over a period of time,",120.219,5.51,125.729,sad
"your body doesn't like that so it's going
to say, ""Stop,"" so it's going to try to protect",125.729,4.421,130.15,sad
"itself and it's going to turn off the receptor,
the thing that receives, so it's going to",130.15,6.45,136.6,sad
"ignore that insulin response, so it's not
going to receive it anymore.",136.6,4.95,141.54999999999998,sad
"Someone's talking but no one's listening,
and that's called a down grade or a blocked",141.55,5.06,146.61,sad
"receptor, so it doesn't receive as much as
it did before, and that's what insulin resistance",146.61,6.42,153.03,sad
"is because it's your body, your cells are
resistant.",153.03,3.72,156.75,sad
"It's inhibiting this absorption because it's
saying, ""Dude, why do you keep eating sugar.",156.75,4.31,161.06,sad
"Would you please stop?""",161.06,2.32,163.38,sad
"What happens when this happens is it forces
insulin to go higher because it's compensating,",163.38,7.21,170.59,sad
"it's on a feedback loop here, so insulin resistance
forces your body to make make more insulin",170.59,5.24,175.83,sad
"to create the same effect because without
this insulin, this sugar stays high and your",175.83,5.71,181.54000000000002,sad
"body does not like that, so it has to lower
it somehow, so it's just going to wear the",181.54,6.48,188.01999999999998,sad
pancreas out.,188.02,2.21,190.23000000000002,sad
"Diabetes is really a situation where you have
high sugar and it won't come down to 100.",190.23,7.34,197.57,sad
We already passed the hypoglycemic thing.,197.57,1.89,199.45999999999998,sad
"We're, type II diabetes is insulin resistance
and because of the, you've been eating too",199.46,6.42,205.88,sad
much sugar.,205.88,1.94,207.82,sad
"When this becomes like that, your body protects
you and several things happen as a consequence,",207.82,6.57,214.39,sad
in addition to jacking up more insulin.,214.39,2.24,216.63,sad
"Number two, you're going to be hungry.",216.63,2.59,219.22,sad
Why?,219.22,1.22,220.44,sad
Because insulin has a few other purposes.,220.44,4.89,225.32999999999998,sad
"It not only lowers the sugar in your blood
but it also helps you absorb the nutrition",225.33,6.17,231.5,sad
"in your cells, so the nutrients, fatty acids,
proteins, vitamins, so without insulin you",231.5,8.96,240.46,sad
"can't get the nutrition in your cells, so
guess what you're going ... You're going to",240.46,3.49,243.95000000000002,sad
be hungry all the time.,243.95,1.0,244.95,sad
You're not going to be satisfied.,244.95,1.86,246.81,neutral
"You eat but it doesn't really go in, so you
have this fat person that's starving to death.",246.81,6.63,253.44,sad
"You can't get healthy like that, and then
you're also going to crave carbs like crazy.",253.44,3.97,257.41,sad
"Just so you know, if you're craving carbs
or sweets, it is literally impossible to burn",257.41,6.58,263.99,sad
"fat, so every time that you're craving, you're
not burning any fat.",263.99,3.03,267.02,sad
Don't worry.,267.02,1.0,268.02,sad
I'll show you how to fix that.,268.02,1.22,269.24,sad
"We've got cravings, hunger and decreased nutrition,
and that's why, over a period of time, diabetics",269.24,5.39,274.63,sad
end up with all sorts of health problems.,274.63,2.16,276.79,sad
They go blind.,276.79,1.12,277.91,sad
"They get their feet start getting, destructive
nerves, so it's called peripheral neuropathy",277.91,4.61,282.52000000000004,sad
"and they get tingly in the feet and the hands,
and they just kind of go down hill.",282.52,5.04,287.56,sad
"Then also, this condition is going to prevent
the storage of sugar.",287.56,6.17,293.73,sad
"It's called glycogen, which basically is a
stored sugar in your liver and your muscles,",293.73,4.03,297.76,sad
"so we need that to live off of when we're
sleeping, between meals, and so if we can't",297.76,7.47,305.23,sad
"store the sugar as much anymore, what happens
is we end up having all sorts of problems",305.23,7.62,312.85,sad
"with storing more fat, if we're not storing
sugar we have to store more fat so you're",312.85,4.95,317.8,sad
"going to keep getting fatter and fatter and
fatter.",317.8,3.01,320.81,sad
"Also, in between the meals, because you can't
have a storage of sugar, you're going to have",320.81,5.35,326.16,sad
"too many highs and too many lows, so it's
going to come up and down too much.",326.16,5.82,331.98,sad
"It's the storage of that sugar that maintains
a nice level sugar, and especially noted with",331.98,6.81,338.79,sad
"you get up in the morning, after not eating
for eight hours.",338.79,2.92,341.71000000000004,sad
There's a couple things I want to cover.,341.71,4.61,346.32,sad
Let's go back to this sugar.,346.32,2.05,348.37,sad
We need 100 milligrams per deciliter.,348.37,4.31,352.68,sad
That would equal about five grams of sugar.,352.68,1.66,354.34000000000003,neutral
"That's like a heaping teaspoon of sugar in
your entire body, on an average person, they",354.34,5.341,359.681,sad
"only need a teaspoon of sugar but not consuming
sugar, but from the food that converts to",359.681,5.439,365.12,sad
"the sugar, even protein and fat can convert
to sugar, so we need about one teaspoon of",365.12,6.32,371.44,sad
sugar.,371.44,1.0,372.44,sad
We don't need more than that.,372.44,1.0,373.44,sad
Check this out.,373.44,1.47,374.91,neutral
"An eight ounce, typical can of soda, an eight
ounce typical glass of orange juice, is about",374.91,9.06,383.97,sad
thirty-nine teaspoons of sugar.,383.97,3.31,387.28000000000003,sad
"Okay, so now we went from five to thirty-nine.",387.28,5.66,392.94,sad
That's a tremendous stress on the pancreas.,392.94,3.02,395.96,sad
Oh my gosh.,395.96,1.38,397.34,sad
"What you're doing is you're just wearing the
thing out.",397.34,1.88,399.21999999999997,sad
"It's creating whiplash of your pancreas, and
because the pancreas has two parts, one is",399.22,5.25,404.47,sad
"a hormone part and the other is an enzyme
part, called the exocrine gland, you're going",404.47,5.32,409.79,sad
"to start having all sorts of digestive problems,
including possible pancreatitis, inflammation",409.79,6.63,416.42,sad

"All sorts of bowel problems, I mean you name
it.",431.97,3.38,435.35,sad
It creates a lot of problems.,435.35,2.08,437.43,sad
"Now, the body is trying to protect itself
from too much insulin so it's going to block",437.43,5.25,442.68,sad

resistance in there, and then the sugar's",442.68,4.403,447.083,sad

sugar and that's where you get all this extra",454.88,5.41,460.29,sad
fat and triglycerides and cholesterol.,460.29,2.26,462.55,sad

high sugar, and then the receptor becomes",484.68,5.97,490.65000000000003,sad
