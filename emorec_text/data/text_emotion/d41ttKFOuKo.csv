hey guys had another question that,0.03,2.73,2.76,surprise
someone want to know the difference,1.74,3.72,5.46,surprise
between having numbness in your hands or,2.76,6.21,8.969999999999999,surprise
feet versus tingling or pins and needle,5.46,4.98,10.440000000000001,
type sensation okay what's the,8.97,2.879,11.849,
difference here's what's probably,10.44,3.869,14.309,
happening when you have low bottom b1 in,11.849,6.481,18.33,
the presence of high blood sugar and/or,14.309,7.411,21.72,
high insulin you're going to destroy the,18.33,5.52,23.849999999999998,
circulation the blood flow to the nerves,21.72,3.87,25.59,
okay and then that leads to something,23.85,4.08,27.93,
called peripheral neuropathy it happens,25.59,4.679,30.269,
in the feet happens in the hands and it,27.93,4.59,32.519999999999996,
starts out as a little tingling then,30.269,5.911,36.18,
pain it can be burning and then pins and,32.52,5.879,38.399,
needles and then the last stage is,36.18,4.92,41.1,
numbness okay as that nerve is dying a,38.399,4.831,43.230000000000004,
simple solution would be to go to the,41.1,4.229,45.329,
health of store or go online and search,43.23,4.98,48.209999999999994,
out a product called benfotiamine this,45.329,6.271,51.6,
is a type of B vitamin that is made into,48.21,6.029,54.239000000000004,
a fat soluble form because normally b1,51.6,4.65,56.25,
is water-soluble but they make it into a,54.239,6.241,60.48,
fat soluble so it can innervate the fat,56.25,6.21,62.46,
that surrounds the nerves a lot better,60.48,4.2,64.67999999999999,
it's called the myelin sheath and yes,62.46,4.019,66.479,
it's synthetic but it doesn't seem to,64.68,4.11,68.79,
have any side effects but it's a great,66.479,5.191,71.67,
remedy for neurological damage it's also,68.79,5.67,74.46000000000001,
good for the damage to your retina when,71.67,5.07,76.74000000000001,
you have diabetes or even as a,74.46,4.89,79.35,
pre-diabetic so this is important this,76.74,5.34,82.08,
is why I always recommend also taking a,79.35,4.08,83.42999999999999,
nutritional yeast because it has the,82.08,2.76,84.84,neutral
natural be bad omens in there because,83.43,3.119,86.549,
this is just one of the beads you want,84.84,4.05,88.89,
to take all of the B's in a natural form,86.549,6.21,92.759,
but sometimes you can actually fix it,88.89,5.369,94.259,
with nutritional yeast but sometimes,92.759,2.97,95.729,
it's so far advanced you need something,94.259,2.371,96.63,
a little bit stronger,95.729,3.331,99.06,
okay so benfotiamine is what you need it,96.63,3.69,100.32,
could be another condition where the,99.06,2.73,101.79,
space inside the spinal column is,100.32,3.119,103.439,
getting smaller and smaller and that's,101.79,3.96,105.75,
called spinal stenosis okay that's,103.439,5.161,108.6,
another condition it could be something,105.75,4.979,110.729,
called thoracic outlet syndrome withers,108.6,4.35,112.94999999999999,
in the neck you have an obstruction,110.729,5.701,116.42999999999999,
whether it's a nerve damage or a spasm,112.95,5.279,118.229,
or some type of problem where it's,116.43,3.42,119.85000000000001,
obstructing not just the nerves but the,118.229,3.811,122.03999999999999,
blood vessels as well and it could also,119.85,5.309,125.15899999999999,
be that you have poor circulation where,122.04,4.649,126.68900000000001,
there's a clogged artery that's also,125.159,3.451,128.61,neutral
causing it but more than likely it's,126.689,4.29,130.97899999999998,
going to be neurological so as you,128.61,3.9,132.51000000000002,
change your diet in Duke,130.979,3.691,134.67000000000002,
in fasting and if that still doesn't,132.51,3.0,135.51,
clear it up,134.67,3.75,138.42,
go get check for a pinched nerve or poor,135.51,6.36,141.87,
circulation thanks for watching so if,138.42,5.19,143.60999999999999,
