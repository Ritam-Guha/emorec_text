hey guys had another question that someone want to know the difference between having numbness in your hands or feet versus tingling or pins and needle type sensation okay what's the,0.03,20.519000000000002,20.549000000000003,NA
difference here's what's probably happening when you have low bottom b1 in the presence of high blood sugar and/or high insulin you're going to destroy the circulation the blood flow to the nerves,10.44,27.151,37.591,NA
okay and then that leads to something called peripheral neuropathy it happens in the feet happens in the hands and it starts out as a little tingling then pain it can be burning and then pins and,23.85,25.138999999999996,48.989,NA
needles and then the last stage is numbness okay as that nerve is dying a simple solution would be to go to the health of store or go online and search out a product called benfotiamine this,36.18,25.231,61.411,NA
is a type of B vitamin that is made into a fat soluble form because normally b1 is water-soluble but they make it into a fat soluble so it can innervate the fat that surrounds the nerves a lot better,48.21,27.330000000000002,75.54,NA
it's called the myelin sheath and yes it's synthetic but it doesn't seem to have any side effects but it's a great remedy for neurological damage it's also good for the damage to your retina when,62.46,24.060000000000002,86.52000000000001,NA
you have diabetes or even as a pre-diabetic so this is important this is why I always recommend also taking a nutritional yeast because it has the natural be bad omens in there because,74.46,20.189,94.649,NA
this is just one of the beads you want to take all of the B's in a natural form but sometimes you can actually fix it with nutritional yeast but sometimes it's so far advanced you need something,84.84,20.97,105.81,NA
a little bit stronger okay so benfotiamine is what you need it could be another condition where the space inside the spinal column is getting smaller and smaller and that's,95.729,16.83,112.559,NA
called spinal stenosis okay that's another condition it could be something called thoracic outlet syndrome withers in the neck you have an obstruction whether it's a nerve damage or a spasm,103.439,25.47,128.909,NA
or some type of problem where it's obstructing not just the nerves but the blood vessels as well and it could also be that you have poor circulation where there's a clogged artery that's also,116.43,20.64,137.07,NA
causing it but more than likely it's going to be neurological so as you change your diet in Duke in fasting and if that still doesn't clear it up,126.689,18.631,145.32,NA
go get check for a pinched nerve or poor circulation thanks for watching so if you're enjoying these videos click share and spread the word,135.51,19.448,154.958,NA
