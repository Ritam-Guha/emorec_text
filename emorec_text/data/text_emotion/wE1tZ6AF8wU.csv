feelings,63.28,3.76,67.04,surprise
i'm just gonna tell you that if you,63.92,4.879,68.799,fear

blood sugars number one you're going to,72.0,4.08,76.08,fear
start going to the bathroom a lot,74.08,4.48,78.56,fear
here's why it happens your kidneys can,76.08,4.48,80.56,fear
only hold on to sugar so much,78.56,4.879,83.43900000000001,surprise
so after 220 blood sugar in diabetics if,80.56,4.559,85.119,fear
your blood sugar is staying above 220,83.439,3.601,87.03999999999999,fear
for a while you're going to dump the,85.119,3.36,88.479,fear
sugar into your bladder,87.04,3.439,90.47900000000001,fear
and as a result you will end up peeing,88.479,3.921,92.4,fear
bunch of sugar and the sugar attracts,90.479,3.6,94.079,fear
water so you're going to end up,92.4,4.399,96.799,fear
urinating a lot and that's going to make,94.079,3.601,97.67999999999999,fear
you what,96.799,2.32,99.119,fear
thirsty of course so you're gonna,97.68,2.799,100.47900000000001,neutral
urinate a lot you're gonna be thirsty,99.119,2.561,101.68,neutral
you're gonna drink more water and you're,100.479,2.481,102.96,neutral
gonna feel like you can drink all the,101.68,2.719,104.399,fear
water in the world you'll still be,102.96,2.799,105.759,fear
thirsty there's a problem,104.399,3.36,107.759,fear
if you don't have diabetes you may have,105.759,3.36,109.119,fear
diabetes so you better check your blood,107.759,2.961,110.72,fear
sugar or get tested,109.119,3.841,112.96,fear
you're going to feel tired as well why,110.72,4.16,114.88,fear
because if your body is not using the,112.96,3.6,116.55999999999999,fear
sugar that's running in your system it's,114.88,2.96,117.83999999999999,fear
like having a bank account with five,116.56,2.72,119.28,fear
million dollars but you cannot pay your,117.84,3.2,121.04,fear
rent that's a problem right it's painful,119.28,2.56,121.84,fear
it's fatigue,121.04,2.64,123.68,fear
it's gonna cause problems and this this,121.84,3.279,125.119,fear
your muscle will not be able to get to,123.68,2.32,126.0,fear
the glucose,125.119,2.721,127.84,fear
and as a result you are going to feel,126.0,3.44,129.44,fear
very tired and of course it's going to,127.84,2.96,130.8,surprise
come with headache as well,129.44,4.159,133.599,fear
again your brain runs on the glucose the,130.8,4.159,134.959,fear
moment that your being,133.599,3.041,136.64,fear
your your brain is unable to get that,134.959,3.521,138.48,fear
glucose then you are going to be in,136.64,3.44,140.07999999999998,fear
trouble and it's going to trigger a,138.48,2.32,140.79999999999998,surprise
headache,140.08,1.92,142.0,neutral
not just high blood sugars but,140.8,3.04,143.84,neutral
fluctuations in your blood sugars,142.0,3.68,145.68,fear
as well sometimes people will tell me,143.84,3.84,147.68,fear
hey if my blood sugar goes down to 110 i,145.68,3.52,149.20000000000002,fear
have a headache well that's not because,147.68,3.199,150.87900000000002,fear
110 blood sugar causes a headache,149.2,3.2,152.39999999999998,fear
it's because they're normally running up,150.879,4.0,154.879,fear
to 200 300 and then sudden drop in the,152.4,4.72,157.12,fear
blood sugar will definitely trigger a,154.879,4.241,159.12,fear
headache as well so fluctuations,157.12,4.24,161.36,fear
are definitely a problem now if your,159.12,3.92,163.04,fear
blood sugars are also running high,161.36,3.84,165.20000000000002,surprise
your lens in your eyes will swell and,163.04,3.919,166.959,neutral
you will start having blurry vision,165.2,3.52,168.72,surprise
so don't think that you're going blind,166.959,3.36,170.31900000000002,surprise
it's totally reversible,168.72,3.2,171.92,fear
but you're going to have blurry vision,170.319,3.28,173.599,fear
and that's not going to,171.92,4.8,176.72,fear
feel right having said that uh if you,173.599,4.401,178.0,fear
don't do anything about these symptoms,176.72,2.799,179.519,fear
then you continue to ignore yourself and,178.0,3.68,181.68,fear
hopefully you don't but if you do,179.519,3.36,182.87900000000002,fear
you may end up with something like,181.68,4.0,185.68,fear
called dka diabetes ketoacidosis now,182.879,4.72,187.599,fear
diabetic ketoacidosis typically happens,185.68,3.36,189.04000000000002,neutral
in type 1 patients,187.599,3.92,191.51899999999998,neutral
however type 2 diabetic patients can end,189.04,3.199,192.239,neutral
up with,191.519,3.041,194.56,neutral
diabetic ketoacidosis especially if,192.239,4.241,196.48000000000002,neutral
there are certain drugs that can make,194.56,3.12,197.68,surprise
them prone to it,196.48,3.28,199.76,fear
or if they leave their blood sugar,197.68,4.0,201.68,fear
staying running high,199.76,5.039,204.79899999999998,fear
for a prolonged period of time what,201.68,3.68,205.36,fear
happens,204.799,3.44,208.239,fear
is we call that gluco toxicity which,205.36,4.879,210.239,fear
means that the glucose the high glucose,208.239,2.56,210.799,fear
levels,210.239,2.961,213.20000000000002,fear
will basically paralyze your pancreas,210.799,4.401,215.20000000000002,fear
and your pancreas will stop making,213.2,4.72,217.92,neutral
insulin so what are the diabetic ketosis,215.2,3.52,218.72,fear
or the symptoms,217.92,3.52,221.44,fear
you're going to have nausea you're going,218.72,4.159,222.879,fear
to have abdominal pain,221.44,5.439,226.879,fear
you may vomit and the acidotic state,222.879,7.201,230.07999999999998,fear
will set in and that's not cool so,226.879,4.0,230.879,fear
basically,230.08,3.12,233.20000000000002,fear
you are going to also have this bad,230.879,4.0,234.879,fear
breath that sounds like a,233.2,4.239,237.439,fear
spoiled fruit and nobody wants to be,234.879,3.201,238.07999999999998,fear
around you,237.439,2.961,240.4,fear
uh so you're gonna feel weak you may,238.08,3.28,241.36,fear
feel confused,240.4,3.119,243.519,neutral
you may breathe rapidly because your,241.36,3.76,245.12,fear
body will try to,243.519,4.161,247.68,fear
excrete that excessive acid through,245.12,3.44,248.56,fear
breathing,247.68,3.199,250.87900000000002,fear
okay so these are the main problems,248.56,4.399,252.959,fear
associated with diabetes again diabetic,250.879,3.201,254.07999999999998,fear
ketoacidosis,252.959,4.081,257.04,fear
is the advanced like the towards the end,254.08,3.92,258.0,fear
stage of,257.04,4.64,261.68,fear

high blood sugars definitely blurred,274.56,4.32,278.88,fear
vision definitely can be,276.8,5.119,281.919,fear

glucose changes as well,285.12,4.48,289.6,fear
so you may realize the blurry vision,286.8,4.08,290.88,fear
