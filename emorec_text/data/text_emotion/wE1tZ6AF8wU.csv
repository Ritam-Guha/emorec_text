hi guys this is dr ahmed ergan i'm an endocrinologist i treat diabetes every day and i am going to answer a common question today,1.04,17.6,18.64,angry
which is the symptoms of high blood sugar so what do you feel like when you have high now a lot of people who are dealing with diabetes at some,9.2,17.759,26.959,angry
point in their life may have felt that they had the low blood sugar symptoms right so it doesn't feel good it's very easily identifiable but today i'm going to talk to you about,19.199,22.0,41.199,angry
high blood sugar symptoms now how do you really know uh that your blood sugars are high now one thing before we jump to that guys make sure you subscribe make sure you give a,29.76,17.441000000000003,47.20100000000001,angry
thumbs up make sure you share this video if you like it now back to the topic guys so a lot of people will sometimes will tell me in my,39.12,18.720000000000002,57.84,angry
in my clinic they'll be like oh doc i don't take my blood sugar i'm like why they'll be like ah well i can feel it what's your blood sugar right now they'll always be wrong now you know,47.76,21.358999999999998,69.119,angry
your feelings are not gonna always tell you what your blood sugar is so i wouldn't recommend just by going by your feelings i'm just gonna tell you that if you,58.64,16.96,75.6,angry
didn't check your blood sugar and you don't feel right and what symptoms can be related to high blood sugars number one you're going to start going to the bathroom a lot,67.04,18.801000000000002,85.84100000000001,angry
here's why it happens your kidneys can only hold on to sugar so much so after 220 blood sugar in diabetics if your blood sugar is staying above 220 for a while you're going to dump the,76.08,20.878999999999998,96.959,sad
sugar into your bladder and as a result you will end up peeing bunch of sugar and the sugar attracts water so you're going to end up urinating a lot and that's going to make,87.04,18.959999999999997,106.0,angry
you what thirsty of course so you're gonna urinate a lot you're gonna be thirsty you're gonna drink more water and you're gonna feel like you can drink all the,96.799,12.879999999999999,109.679,angry
water in the world you'll still be thirsty there's a problem if you don't have diabetes you may have diabetes so you better check your blood sugar or get tested,102.96,16.321,119.28099999999999,angry
you're going to feel tired as well why because if your body is not using the sugar that's running in your system it's like having a bank account with five million dollars but you cannot pay your,110.72,16.64,127.36,sad
rent that's a problem right it's painful it's fatigue it's gonna cause problems and this this your muscle will not be able to get to the glucose,119.28,13.52,132.8,sad
and as a result you are going to feel very tired and of course it's going to come with headache as well again your brain runs on the glucose the moment that your being,126.0,17.759,143.75900000000001,sad
your your brain is unable to get that glucose then you are going to be in trouble and it's going to trigger a headache not just high blood sugars but,134.959,14.241,149.2,sad
fluctuations in your blood sugars as well sometimes people will tell me hey if my blood sugar goes down to 110 i have a headache well that's not because 110 blood sugar causes a headache,142.0,17.439,159.439,sad
it's because they're normally running up to 200 300 and then sudden drop in the blood sugar will definitely trigger a headache as well so fluctuations are definitely a problem now if your,150.879,21.121000000000002,172.0,sad
blood sugars are also running high your lens in your eyes will swell and you will start having blurry vision so don't think that you're going blind it's totally reversible,161.36,17.839,179.199,angry
but you're going to have blurry vision and that's not going to feel right having said that uh if you don't do anything about these symptoms then you continue to ignore yourself and,170.319,18.96,189.279,angry
hopefully you don't but if you do you may end up with something like called dka diabetes ketoacidosis now diabetic ketoacidosis typically happens in type 1 patients,179.519,19.36,198.87900000000002,angry
however type 2 diabetic patients can end up with diabetic ketoacidosis especially if there are certain drugs that can make them prone to it,189.04,16.881,205.921,sad
or if they leave their blood sugar staying running high for a prolonged period of time what happens is we call that gluco toxicity which,197.68,21.037999999999997,218.71800000000002,sad
means that the glucose the high glucose levels will basically paralyze your pancreas and your pancreas will stop making insulin so what are the diabetic ketosis,208.239,18.162,226.401,angry
or the symptoms you're going to have nausea you're going to have abdominal pain you may vomit and the acidotic state will set in and that's not cool so,217.92,24.319,242.23899999999998,angry
basically you are going to also have this bad breath that sounds like a spoiled fruit and nobody wants to be around you,230.08,17.521,247.601,angry
uh so you're gonna feel weak you may feel confused you may breathe rapidly because your body will try to excrete that excessive acid through,238.08,17.759999999999998,255.84,angry
breathing okay so these are the main problems associated with diabetes again diabetic ketoacidosis is the advanced like the towards the end,247.68,18.799999999999997,266.48,angry
stage of uh diabetes uh symptoms uh on that scale but if you are feeling excessive urination if you're having excessive urination if you're feeling thirsty a,257.04,20.720000000000002,277.76000000000005,angry
lot if you're feeling headache weak tired those are the symptoms of high blood sugars definitely blurred vision definitely can be,267.52,25.039,292.55899999999997,angry
a quick tip for you if you don't feel any of these some people's eyes are very sensitive to glucose changes as well so you may realize the blurry vision,278.88,19.680999999999997,298.561,angry
faster than some other symptoms sometimes so i hope that was useful guys so please make sure you subscribe give a thumbs up and like our video and,289.6,16.88,306.48,angry
