i'd had health issues off and on for,0.399,4.641,5.04,surprise
several years i was in the process of,2.96,4.64,7.6,surprise
changing doctors the doctor had,5.04,4.16,9.2,neutral
asked me to come in and do some initial,7.6,3.999,11.599,neutral
setup work do blood tests blood work and,9.2,4.08,13.28,neutral
things like that,11.599,4.0,15.599,neutral
and he then called me a few days later,13.28,3.839,17.119,neutral
after i'd done the initial blood work,15.599,4.401,20.0,neutral
and said i need to see you today,17.119,4.801,21.92,neutral
at that point my,20.0,4.88,24.88,neutral
stomach fell out of me i was terrified,21.92,3.84,25.76,neutral
because,24.88,2.719,27.599,neutral
it was just scary,25.76,4.24,30.0,neutral
and at that point i went in and spoke,27.599,4.401,32.0,neutral
with him and he said,30.0,4.88,34.88,neutral
your blood tests are back and you're,32.0,4.64,36.64,neutral
borderline diabetic i want to throw you,34.88,3.359,38.239000000000004,neutral
into the diabetic category but i want to,36.64,3.68,40.32,neutral
give you a chance to remedy the,38.239,3.761,42.0,neutral
situation first,40.32,4.079,44.399,neutral
i was aware of pre-diabetes as a,42.0,3.6,45.6,
condition,44.399,3.521,47.92,
it was somewhat foreign to me,45.6,3.68,49.28,
because it was just something that i'd,47.92,3.36,51.28,
heard about kind of vaguely off of the,49.28,3.52,52.800000000000004,
periphery somewhere,51.28,4.88,56.160000000000004,neutral
but once i heard about it once he said,52.8,6.48,59.28,neutral
you have this or you're borderline,56.16,5.919,62.07899999999999,neutral
diabetic at that point i started doing,59.28,5.36,64.64,
some research about what do i need to do,62.079,4.961,67.04,
what are treatment options is there a,64.64,4.64,69.28,
way to come back from this,67.04,3.119,70.159,
and,69.28,2.72,72.0,
at that point i kind of made a,70.159,3.681,73.84,
resolution to myself that i was going to,72.0,4.24,76.24,
make some changes in my life and,73.84,3.52,77.36,
try to,76.24,3.04,79.28,
do something to remedy this,77.36,3.84,81.2,
people at the diabetes resource center,79.28,5.04,84.32000000000001,
provided an excellent framework in that,81.2,4.72,85.92,
they looked at all of the things that,84.32,3.68,88.0,neutral
you know how to do for the most part i,85.92,3.68,89.60000000000001,neutral
mean eat less,88.0,4.72,92.72,neutral
calories work out more but they gave you,89.6,5.6,95.19999999999999,neutral
specific and focused,92.72,5.12,97.84,
direction as to what particular things,95.2,5.12,100.32000000000001,
that you either doing improperly or you,97.84,4.319,102.159,
need to do better,100.32,4.32,104.63999999999999,neutral
they were mentors they were,102.159,6.161,108.32000000000001,neutral
encouraging they were always friendly,104.64,6.799,111.43900000000001,neutral
they weren't negative about aspects they,108.32,4.88,113.19999999999999,neutral
would they would nudge you in the right,111.439,3.521,114.96,neutral
direction,113.2,4.239,117.43900000000001,neutral
if i had not gotten this diagnosis,114.96,3.28,118.24,
i,117.439,3.921,121.36,
probably would be in a situation where,118.24,6.08,124.32,
five years down the road i'd be 260 270,121.36,5.439,126.799,
pounds still still eating on the road,124.32,4.159,128.47899999999998,
and not really paying attention to what,126.799,4.961,131.76000000000002,neutral
i was eating i would be diabetic i might,128.479,4.881,133.36,neutral
have a stroke at some point in the not,131.76,4.16,135.92,neutral
too distant future,133.36,5.04,138.4,neutral
just just generally not healthy i,135.92,4.56,140.48,neutral
probably wouldn't see my son graduate,138.4,4.479,142.87900000000002,
high school or college and get married,140.48,3.36,143.84,
and,142.879,2.321,145.2,
wouldn't be able to live a long life,143.84,3.36,147.20000000000002,neutral
with my wife and those are things that,145.2,4.08,149.28,neutral
are very important to me,147.2,5.6,152.79999999999998,
my message to a pre-diabetic would be,149.28,6.48,155.76,
that small steps at first will get you a,152.8,4.48,157.28,
long way,155.76,3.839,159.599,
back away from,157.28,5.039,162.319,neutral
diabetic condition of any type it's not,159.599,5.601,165.2,neutral
difficult necessarily but you do have to,162.319,4.64,166.95899999999997,neutral
make some changes and you do have to,165.2,5.759,170.959,neutral
make some decisions on what's important,166.959,4.0,170.959,
