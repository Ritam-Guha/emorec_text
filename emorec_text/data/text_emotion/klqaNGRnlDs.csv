are damaged or stop working for whatever reason There’s a number of different reasons and
it is the Vagus nerve that they believe to be the problem. And I don’t mean like Las Vegas... party... I can see where the link would be but it's
not vagus it is the Vagus nerve.",41.6,19.22,60.82,sad

combinations of things that can cause it but",60.92,20.759999999999998,81.68,angry

Gastroparesis. So if you are diabetic that is a very common

talking like worse than giving birth pain. Times the whole cold thing by like 50 and

try, you just bring it straight back up",289.129,30.051000000000002,319.18,sad

diagnose gastroparesis.",356.73,22.939999999999998,379.67,sad
"And you could have one of the tests, you could
have all of the tests. But the first thing that you will probably
have is an endoscopy which is a little camera going up your nose, down the back of your
throat and into your stomach. And it’s kind of like examining your stomach
lining and rules out other causes or conditions that could be going on.",379.75,21.979000000000003,401.729,angry
"Another thing that they can do is a barium
x-ray. Basically where you swallow a liquid which
is containing a chemical and it kind of has a chalky kind of texture from what I can feel. Not that I swallow chalk on a regular basis
but it's just what you would imagine chalk to be like.",401.729,18.91,420.639,angry
"And you swallow it and you basically watch
it on an x-ray and you can watch its like, it going through your digestive track. Another one which they can do and one that
I had, is a soup test. So it is basically an ultra sound and you
have to stop eating at a certain time. Then they do an ultrasound of your stomach
to see if there’s any food left in there.",420.639,24.37,445.009,sad
"How much is in there. That kind of thing. Then they make you have some soup or some
form of liquid that they have and then after so long they will check your stomach again
through the ultrasound and see what food is in there,
how much is left in there,",445.009,16.561,461.57,angry
"if anythings digested. That kind of thing. And it's not that bad of a test and I had
it and they actually ended up putting me on a liquid diet because,
it showed that I had a whole meal in there even though I hadn’t eaten for like 2 days.",461.57,14.658999999999999,476.229,sad
"Another test and I think is probably the main
test they use to diagnose Gastroparesis and it’s called the Gastric Emptying Test. This is basically a large machine that you
lie under and give you some food. I think I had mashed potato, which has a small
amount of radioactive dye in it and they basically watch your digestive system
for like 4 hours or so",476.229,29.08,505.30899999999997,sad
"and they see how long it takes for your body
to digest it and how much is in your stomach you know each
hour. As normal person food would be digested by
like 4 hours or most of it would be digested. So I think the number 
that they use is 10%. So if you have 10% or more of the food left in your stomach after 4 hours, then your diagnosis of Gastroparesis is there. And they can tell you how bad it is basically.",505.309,29.091,534.4,sad
"A newer version that I know that they're doing is the wireless capsule test. So it is a little capsule which I think has a camera in it and tracks the speed it moves through the digestive system. It is similar to the gastric emptying test but it is just done with a capsule. I have swallowing problems so i would never be able to have that. But i believe that this is like the newest thing that they're trying. [Music] Like I 
mentioned before there is no cure to Gastroparesis.",534.48,27.96,562.44,angry
"There’s just ways of managing the symptoms
so that you can live as normal a life as possible. One of the biggest things and probably the
first things that they will do is a dietary change. What they will probably get you to do is have
6 smaller meals in a day rather than 3 big meals.",563.49,19.580000000000002,583.07,angry
"And I mean we are all supposed to do that
anyway but I mean who’s got time for that in reality? It's hard to do when you’re living life
and you're at school or you're working. It is hard but it is really important with
Gastroparesis because it gives your body that little helping
hand to keep the motility of the stomach and",583.07,21.59,604.6600000000001,angry
"the digestive system going. But also gives it more of a chance to digest
food rather than just shoving it all in there which is totally what I do still. Another dietary change that they will make
you do, is to try softer foods that are easier to
digest rather than the harder foods that need",604.66,18.96,623.62,angry
"more work and take longer anyway. And chew like your food really really well. I know sometimes we just, we’re in a hurry
and we just kind of suck it and swallow it ewww …
but in reality we really need to chew our food because that is a form of digesting it.",623.62,19.36,642.98,angry
"So if it’s already broken down then,
it's going to be easier digest on the inside. And another dietary change that I personally
have found massively helpful is taking out any fizzy drinks. I wasn’t a big fizzy drink person anyways,
but I would have the odd one here and there But the gas and the bubbles and that…
will just play havoc on your insides.",642.98,23.21,666.19,sad

it makes you look like 9 months pregnant which a lot of food does. That's Gastroparesis And fatty food, sugary foods and basically
all the foods that you love…",666.19,14.92,681.11,sad
"yeah you gotta limite them because your body
doesn’t love it. Basically is the gist of it. Another form of treatment for Gastroparesis
is the medication route. Obviously we don’t want to be on medication
for life but if it helps then it’s giving you a life is my point of view on it.",681.11,21.14,702.25,angry
"So the first medication that I was ever put
on and it’s the most popular one anyone’s ever put on if you’re in the UK, if you’re
in the USA I know it’s banned there. And that is Domperidone.. not Domperidon the
wine or is it champagne? You can tell I’m a drinker HaHa
And this is actually called motilium for some brands and it basically helps the motility
and the movement of your insides.",702.25,24.839999999999996,727.09,angry
"The only problem with this medication is they’re
saying that there is a risk of heart problems with it which is why I have been taken off
of it but I’m not very good off of it. I need it every so often but they’ve taken
me off it for the most part. And is the reason why it is banned in the
US is it is said to have a lot of problems",727.091,24.459,751.55,angry
"with your heart further down the line. Anti sickness is another one that I was put
on and that does exactly what it says it does. It helps with the sickness and the nausea
and I really notice a difference if I don’t take it with my sickness levels and nausea
levels. And if i don’t it for a period of time i
am likely to ….",751.55,20.648999999999997,772.199,sad
"And I actually have a fear of being sick. So, not the best combination. Another medication that you’re likely to
be given if you are on a lot of medication is something like Lansoprazole or Omeprazole. One of those which basically helps protect
the lining of the stomach.",772.199,18.701,790.9,angry
"Another one that I have been on and tried
is an antiepileptic medication and this just means it kind of helps the spasms
that your nerve do rather than doing what they’re supposed to do. I am on Pregabalin and I find it’s probably
my most helpful medication, alongside the anti sickness medication.",790.9,23.82,814.72,happy
"When I’m not on it I notice the pain is
worse, which causes the sickness to be worse,
Your mood to be worse. Everything to be worse. So I don’t know if that’s like a kind
of world wide thing or that’s just from my pain management.",814.72,15.418999999999999,830.139,sad
"A pain medication that I’m on is Ketamine. I know this is a fairly new one and not many
places do this just yet. I think it’s kind of becoming slowly a bit
bigger. But I get injections of ketamine every 2-3
weeks which helps to switch off the nerve. There are other ways of doing this, you can
kind of do it with local aneasthetics and",830.139,24.361,854.5,angry

that i’ve tried, I am on, i’ve had. And we are still trying to get the dosage
there but I do notice when I haven’t had it or
when it’s starting to wear off.",854.5,15.899000000000001,870.399,happy
"It is a horse tranquiliser. I know. And it’s not safe if you have it every single
day, 3 times a day but in the way that my pain management team
are doing it, it is very safe. Which is just under supervision, with my blood
pressure being monitored because it can make",870.399,19.771,890.17,sad

So if you haven’t heard of it maybe you",890.17,16.12,906.29,angry
"could ask your pain management team about
it. Because i do rate it very highly. Another form of treatment that people have
used and I personally have as well is an electrical implant. So a pacemaker for the stomach.",906.29,14.579999999999998,920.87,angry
"And it does exactly what a pacemaker would
do in the heart which is kind of shock the nerves into contracting
and doing what they’re supposed to do. It does the exact same thing but to the nerves
in the stomach. And for me, I find it does help a lot. It’s more sickness than it is for pain.",920.87,21.269,942.139,happy

a bit fussy about covering it. And doing the operation. Another treatment that I have had
which a lot of you will know if you have seen my videos for a long time or if you have watched
any of my tube related ones. Is a feeding tube of some description.",942.139,18.861000000000004,961.0,NA

feeding tubes and a lot of the ones you will get if you
have Gastroparesis go into the Jejunum rather than into your stomach. And that is small intestine which is where
your food ends up after you have eaten. And that’s basically to avoid the area that
is the problem basically because it would",961.0,20.16,981.16,NA

of different ones. I have had two types. I have had the PEGJ tube which goes through
your stomach wall and down into your small intestine.",981.16,13.83,994.99,NA
"I’ve also had the Nasojejunal tube which
again a lot of you would have seen, probably more so than the other one. It goes up your nose,
down the back of your throat, through your stomach and through into your
intestines. And you then connect this to a machine which
pumps in a liquid feed that has all the nutrition",994.99,19.62,1014.61,NA

and everything that your body needs to survive. Similar to a feeding tube is a picc line or
a hickman line, there’s a few different ones. That’s basically where you have a little
needle that goes into like, around this kind of area
and it feeds you through your heart.",1014.61,18.68,1033.29,NA

tendency to cause sepsis and infection after infection. If it’s going to save your life then that’s
one thing but that is definitely not something that
I would jump into. I know there’s obviously alternative therapies
you can try.",1033.29,18.14,1051.43,NA
