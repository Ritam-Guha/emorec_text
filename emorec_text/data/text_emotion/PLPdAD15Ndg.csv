"A diabetic foot ulceration is a very dangerous
skin breakdown, opening the door to bacterial infection and possible amputation of the affected
foot. Most skin ulcers occur at the bottom aspect
of the feet as a result of these areas are subject to weight bearing. The most prevalent areas affected by skin
breakdown include:",23.75,21.1,44.85,sad
"- Bottom aspect of the feet, mainly heels
and ball of the foot; and - Tips of the most prominent or the most hypercontracted
toes. The poor peripheral blood circulation of diabetic
people, sometimes complicated with poor distal nerve conduction and protection, sooner or
later weaken the ability of the skin of the affected feet to regenerate and heal.",44.85,22.79,67.64,sad
"Ulcers will develop because feet are far away
from the hearth, the very last to receive blood nutrients as well as the very first
to suffer from an impaired blood circulation. The reduced blood flow to the foot results
is slow healing and low sensitivity. As a result, diabetic foot ulcers are responsible
for more hospitalizations than any other complication associated with diabetes.",67.64,20.549,88.189,sad

procedures when it comes to the treatment of your feet.",88.189,4.67,92.859,happy
