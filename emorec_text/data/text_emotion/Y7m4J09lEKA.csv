important to get that one-on-one contact with my patients to make sure that they're staying on track with lifestyle changes they're taking their medications appropriately or there's not something,141.57,21.990000000000002,163.56,angry

them the option of meeting with our behavioral health consultant to identify behaviors that might be impacting their diabetes [Music],165.69,24.020000000000003,189.71,angry
