diabetic retinopathy occurs when the,6.95,4.51,11.46,
blood vessels to the retina become,9.389,4.471,13.86,happy
blocked the retina sits in the back of,11.46,4.56,16.02,
the eye and is where our vision begins,13.86,5.91,19.77,
our body tries to supply blood to any,16.02,6.39,22.41,
organ any way possible so it tries to,19.77,5.22,24.99,
find new ways to do this when a vessel,22.41,4.14,26.55,
becomes blocked which can lead to,24.99,6.23,31.22,
blindness or detachment of the river,26.55,4.67,31.22,
it's one of the leading causes of,32.989,4.271,37.26,
blindness in the United States but it is,35.219,3.84,39.059,happy
the leading cause of blindness and,37.26,5.31,42.57,fear
people who are aged 25 to 60 we know,39.059,6.601,45.66,fear
that over 60% of our diabetics will have,42.57,5.25,47.82,fear
an eventual diagnosis of diabetic,45.66,8.85,54.51,
retinopathy diabetes and uncontrolled,47.82,9.719,57.539,
blood sugars affect the vasculature all,54.51,4.92,59.43,fear
over our bodies and cause significant,57.539,3.901,61.44,fear
damage our smallest vessels are at the,59.43,4.32,63.75,fear
highest risk for this damage which is,61.44,3.869,65.309,fear
especially true for the vessels in the,63.75,2.6,66.35,
back of the eye,65.309,2.721,68.03,
[Music],66.35,3.03,69.38,
[Applause],68.03,4.18,72.21000000000001,
this disease is not a catastrophic event,69.38,4.9,74.28,
it is progressive the longer a patient,72.21,4.77,76.97999999999999,fear
has uncontrolled blood sugars the higher,74.28,5.26,79.54,fear
their risk is for diabetic retinopathy,76.98,5.9,82.88000000000001,
[Music],79.54,5.48,85.02000000000001,
our patients with diabetes are,82.88,4.33,87.21,
recommended to get checked yearly with a,85.02,4.44,89.46,fear
comprehensive diabetic eye exam,87.21,4.409,91.619,fear
diabetics are also at higher risk for,89.46,4.05,93.50999999999999,fear
other diseases that affect the eye such,91.619,4.231,95.85,fear
as glaucoma and cataracts some of our,93.51,4.26,97.77000000000001,fear
primary care offices here at Christiana,95.85,3.96,99.80999999999999,fear
Care offer retinal screenings in the,97.77,4.83,102.6,fear
office these are effective tools to,99.81,4.86,104.67,fear
screen for diabetic retinopathy but,102.6,4.2,106.8,fear
should not replace the comprehensive eye,104.67,4.35,109.02,fear
exam because these retinal cameras do,106.8,4.63,111.42999999999999,
not screen for any of the other diseases,109.02,5.54,114.56,
[Music],111.43,5.89,117.32000000000001,
the first and probably most important is,114.56,5.19,119.75,
developing a healthy lifestyle which,117.32,5.97,123.28999999999999,fear
includes eating well and exercising on a,119.75,6.45,126.2,fear
regular basis the other modality that we,123.29,4.8,128.09,fear
use to help our patients control their,126.2,3.27,129.47,fear
blood Sugar's is with the use of,128.09,4.13,132.22,
medication,129.47,2.75,132.22,
so we usually recommend our diabetic,133.71,3.78,137.49,
patients see their primary care,136.02,3.81,139.83,fear
physician at least twice a year as a,137.49,4.08,141.57000000000002,fear
family physician I think it's very,139.83,3.66,143.49,fear
important to get that one-on-one contact,141.57,4.41,145.98,fear
with my patients to make sure that,143.49,4.83,148.32000000000002,fear
they're staying on track with lifestyle,145.98,4.35,150.32999999999998,fear
changes they're taking their medications,148.32,4.41,152.73,fear
appropriately or there's not something,150.33,3.99,154.32000000000002,fear
else that's going on that could be,152.73,4.5,157.23,fear
contributing to their diabetes not being,154.32,5.79,160.10999999999999,fear
under control it also allows me to talk,157.23,5.52,162.75,fear
about any social issues that might be,160.11,5.58,165.69000000000003,fear
impacting their disease and even give,162.75,4.86,167.61,fear
them the option of meeting with our,165.69,3.66,169.35,fear
behavioral health consultant to identify,167.61,4.08,171.69000000000003,fear
