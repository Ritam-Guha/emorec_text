"hey guys so today I want to talk to you
about the Dario glucose monitoring system this one it's a glucose meter but
it's actually way more than that so it's FDA cleared meaning that's accurate but
it's not just accurate measuring test over test I was really impressed with
how accurate and it gives you the reading in less than six seconds so
that's pretty neat as well but when I",0.03,21.150000000000002,21.180000000000003,sad
"save so much more it's so much more
because you use this with your phone so the people at Dario automatically know
if you're running low in strips so if you sign up for one of the programs you
get unlimited test strips every month that means that if they
know that you're running low they'll just automatically ship those to you you
can also sign up for different programs",21.18,21.78,42.96,sad
"and you can even get access to their
coaches so if that's what you need that's what you can get there but let me
show you how to use it so you use it together with your phone there we go so
here we go that's what that looks like okay so how does it work let me show you
again everything is in this little device you just slide it and there's the
actual meter look at that it's tiny",42.96,24.089,67.049,sad
"so that little meter slide into your
phone like that and it automatically connects and it'll ask you to insert the
test strips so where are the test strips they're in here too right here okay so
picking up the phone again just insert that into the slot and you'll tell you
to add a blood drop we can do that where is our Lancet device
it's in here too it's up here so it's",67.049,35.551,102.60000000000001,sad
"just there we go the spring is ready I
just push that button okay so hold drop against my finger push the button there

hold it up against the meter oh there were already go and in six seconds we
will, less than six seconds we will",102.6,22.53,125.13,sad
"know the reading oh that's pretty neat
so see now I came up with all these options because
the cool thing about the app is it can help us track not just our blood sugar's
but also what kind of activities you know when did we take this blood sugar
did we eat how much insulin did we take etc so it's a really cool one-stop
shop for all your data so this I have to look",125.13,21.139,146.269,sad
"at it it's post meal meaning I just ate
okay so if it had been pre meal I could have put in how many
carbohydrates I've even taken like photos of my food and they also have a
database with different kinds of food so you can store all this click that little
checkmark up in the corner my phone there we go and now it's recorded so
it's all in the lock book you can share",146.269,22.921,169.19,sad
"that with your coach or with your doctor
and just help you manage your diabetes pretty neat",169.19,7.07,176.26,happy
