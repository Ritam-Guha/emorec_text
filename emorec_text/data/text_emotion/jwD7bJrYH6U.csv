"If you’ve had a urinary tract infection
(UTI) before, you know they’re annoying! You have to start running to the bathroom
more, it hurts to pee, and somehow you have to get antibiotics. UTIs are usually caused by bacteria, therefore,
antibiotics typically solve the problem. If your UTI symptoms do not go away with antibiotics,
you may actually have something called painful",3.03,20.330000000000002,23.360000000000003,fear
"bladder syndrome and it’s worth while to
see your urologist to clarify this. UTIs are most common in women because women
have a short urethra, which is the tube you pee through. It’s only about 2-3 centimeters in length. Therefore, it’s not hard for bacteria to
travel across your urethra and set up shop",23.36,18.038999999999998,41.399,fear
"in your bladder. Common risk factors for a UTI include: 1) Having diabetes.
2) Having kidney stones. 3) Being postmenopausal.
4) Some of you will  have the great fortune of having multiple
UTIs in a year and this can really impact",41.399,21.671,63.07,fear
"your quality of life. My question for these patients tends to be,
do you notice a pattern of when you get UTIs? Flights, long car rides and dehydration tend
to be very common things that lead to UTIs because they reduce the number of times you’re
going to the bathroom. However, the most common cause is related
to sex.",63.07,16.659,79.729,fear
"Why? We have a lot of bacteria between our legs,
there’s bacteria around the anus and it’s just not that hard for the mechanics of sex
to push bacteria into the vagina and urethra. What’s really important for a women is to
make sure that you urinate within 5 to 10 minutes after having sex.",79.729,17.0,96.729,fear
"Why? This washes any bacteria out from where it
shouldn’t be! Unfortunately, there are all sorts of magazines
out there that support all sorts of rituals – there’s really no data to support one
ritual over another. Really, all you need to do is urinate after
sex.",96.729,12.701,109.43,fear
"Sex can also cause small tears in the vagina
and urethra. This can reduce some of your natural defenses
to fight off infection. This may be from certain positions or lubrication. Regardless, if you’re running into this
problem, you’ll know it quickly since it’ll burn to urinate right after you have sex.",109.43,20.910000000000004,130.34,fear
"General prevention strategies for a UTI include: 1) Staying well hydrated so that you urinate
every 2-3 hours. 2) When you urinate, make sure you wipe from
the vagina back to the anus. 3) Urinate after sex to wash out any unwanted
bacteria. 4) Consider more breathable, cotton underwear.",130.34,22.819000000000003,153.159,fear
"Something I’ve found anecdotally helpful
for my patients, however, there’s no research to really support this. Now, you might be doing all of these things
and STILL be getting UTIs. In scenarios like this, cranberry can come
into play! Cranberry has an active ingredient that reduces
the ability of bacteria to stick to your bladder",153.159,18.601,171.76,fear
"wall. There are mixed studies on how effective cranberry
is. However, the studies that showed support used
10-12 ounces a day of ocean spray cranberry juice cocktail. There are a lot of cranberry pills or supplements
on the market, of which I don’t tend to",171.76,17.67,189.43,fear
"recommend since it’s hard to check on the
purity of their ingredients. Also, because it’s an unregulated market,
many of these pills and supplements are very expensive! If you don’t want to use cranberry, consider
using D-Mannose. It works in the same way by reducing the ability
for bacteria to stick to your bladder wall.",189.43,21.33,210.76,fear
"Studies that were successful with D-Mannose
showed that using 2 grams in 200 ml (i.e. ~ 8 ounces) of water daily. If neither cranberry or D-Mannose end up working,
talk with your doctor about using an antibiotic. See if they recommend using a low dose antibiotic
daily or taking an antibiotic before “high risk” UTI scenarios (i.e. before sex, a
long car ride or flight).",210.76,21.020000000000003,231.78,fear
"Both of these options can reduce your risk
for infections as well. For women who are postmenopausal, the loss
of estrogen reduces the strength of some of your vaginal and urethra tissue. However, a vagina estrogen cream can be really
helpful in giving you some of this tissue balk back for better natural defenses against
an infection.",231.78,22.86,254.64,fear

or get ride of UTIs. Please, see your doctor to talk about what
will be the best options for you moving forward!",254.64,7.92,262.56,fear
