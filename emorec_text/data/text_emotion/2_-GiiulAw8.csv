hey in this quick video I want to talk,0.14,4.719,4.859,happy
to you about something called the Dolan,2.939,4.201,7.14,happy
phenomenon or the dawn effect this,4.859,4.891,9.75,happy
happens to every human on the planet and,7.14,4.49,11.629999999999999,happy
now that some of you are using,9.75,4.98,14.73,fear
glucometers as a tool to test your,11.63,4.93,16.560000000000002,fear
health and test your blood sugar you're,14.73,3.78,18.51,fear
catching this and I'm gonna explain to,16.56,4.5,21.06,fear
you what it is now first before I start,18.51,4.08,22.590000000000003,fear
I want you to take one second and click,21.06,3.27,24.33,angry
that subscribe button right down there,22.59,4.32,26.91,fear
that says subscribe and that way every,24.33,4.17,28.5,fear
time I get a bright idea you'll be one,26.91,3.539,30.449,fear
of the very first to know about it now,28.5,4.59,33.09,fear
let's talk about the dawn phenomenon or,30.449,5.971,36.42,fear
the dawn effects so this I've heard a,33.09,6.809,39.899,fear
couple of experts miss describe this in,36.42,4.709,41.129000000000005,fear
the past few days and that's why I,39.899,3.18,43.079,fear
wanted to make a video so you guys would,41.129,4.321,45.449999999999996,fear
know exactly what's going on with the,43.079,4.05,47.129,fear
dawn effect I'm gonna call it that,45.45,3.359,48.809000000000005,fear
because that saves me some syllables in,47.129,4.95,52.079,fear
the course of this video so everyone,48.809,6.39,55.199,fear
when we're going from sleeping to waking,52.079,5.07,57.149,fear
right when you're waking up in the,55.199,3.691,58.89,fear
morning sometime between 2 a.m. and 8,57.149,5.371,62.52,fear
a.m. for most of us your body has to do,58.89,5.43,64.32,fear
things to actually wake you up and I,62.52,3.54,66.06,fear
know the alarm clock wakes most of you,64.32,2.97,67.28999999999999,fear
love but you're already in the process,66.06,3.3,69.36,fear
of waking up before the alarm clock goes,67.29,5.54,72.83000000000001,fear
off your body does this by increasing,69.36,7.049,76.409,fear
secretions of cortisol epinephrine which,72.83,5.98,78.81,fear
is adrenaline and nor epinephrine which,76.409,4.921,81.33000000000001,fear
is noradrenaline depending on if you're,78.81,4.739,83.549,fear
watching this from the US and Canada or,81.33,5.39,86.72,fear
the UK so there's a there's a temporal,83.549,6.231,89.78,fear
elevation of these three hormones and,86.72,5.74,92.46,fear
that makes your blood sugar go up a few,89.78,5.08,94.86,fear
points now I've heard experts say in the,92.46,4.11,96.57,fear
last few days that this happens only in,94.86,3.899,98.759,fear
diabetics which is absolutely not true,96.57,3.81,100.38,fear
to my knowledge it happens in every,98.759,3.451,102.21,fear
human on the face of the planet every,100.38,3.83,104.21,fear
morning and then I've also heard people,102.21,4.619,106.829,fear
imply that it only happens if you're,104.21,4.75,108.96,fear
eating a ketogenic diet which is also,106.829,4.711,111.53999999999999,fear
silly and untrue this happens to,108.96,4.86,113.82,fear
everyone when they're waking up and some,111.54,4.41,115.95,fear
of you may start a lake like Oh,113.82,4.439,118.25899999999999,fear
something scared me that's the,115.95,4.169,120.119,fear
adrenaline right in the cortisol and,118.259,4.201,122.46,fear
when that happens your blood sugar goes,120.119,5.64,125.759,fear
up anywhere from 5 to 25 points but it,122.46,4.769,127.229,fear
doesn't stay up it's only up for a,125.759,3.39,129.149,neutral
little while and a lot of you have been,127.229,3.601,130.83,fear
checking a fasting blood sugar and,129.149,3.991,133.14000000000001,fear
that's how you've caught this this dawn,130.83,3.09,133.92000000000002,fear
effect,133.14,2.64,135.77999999999997,fear
right but then if you check again in an,133.92,3.48,137.39999999999998,fear
hour your blood Sugar's right back down,135.78,3.72,139.5,fear
to normal so there's no danger from this,137.4,3.78,141.18,fear
if you're a diabetic and you have this,139.5,3.84,143.34,fear
almost never should you adjust your,141.18,4.95,146.13,fear
medications based on this so don't worry,143.34,4.74,148.08,fear
about it just know about it and if,146.13,4.17,150.29999999999998,fear
you're using a glucometer - and sticking,148.08,3.96,152.04000000000002,fear
your finger watching your blood sugar,150.3,3.87,154.17000000000002,fear
carefully making sure that you don't,152.04,4.98,157.01999999999998,fear
have signs of hyperglycemia or insulin,154.17,5.73,159.89999999999998,fear
resistance then you'll know that's the,157.02,4.85,161.87,fear
dawn effect it's nothing to worry about,159.9,4.35,164.25,fear
like I said your blood sugar can go up,161.87,4.66,166.53,fear
anywhere from five to thirty points give,164.25,5.01,169.26,fear
or take depending on the person and it's,166.53,4.56,171.09,fear
not bad it's not dangerous there's,169.26,4.82,174.07999999999998,fear
nothing you need to do the amount of,171.09,5.13,176.22,fear
carbs that you've eaten the day before,174.08,4.42,178.5,fear
really don't have much of an effect on,176.22,4.89,181.10999999999999,fear
this at all and it's nothing to worry,178.5,4.739,183.239,fear
about it's called the dawn effect or the,181.11,5.159,186.269,fear
dawn phenomenon and you'll see this if,183.239,4.231,187.47,fear
