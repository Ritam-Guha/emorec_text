to you about something called the Dolan,2.939,4.201,7.14,sad
phenomenon or the dawn effect this,4.859,4.891,9.75,sad
happens to every human on the planet and,7.14,4.49,11.629999999999999,fear
now that some of you are using,9.75,4.98,14.73,sad
glucometers as a tool to test your,11.63,4.93,16.560000000000002,sad
health and test your blood sugar you're,14.73,3.78,18.51,sad
catching this and I'm gonna explain to,16.56,4.5,21.06,sad
you what it is now first before I start,18.51,4.08,22.590000000000003,sad
I want you to take one second and click,21.06,3.27,24.33,sad
that subscribe button right down there,22.59,4.32,26.91,sad
that says subscribe and that way every,24.33,4.17,28.5,sad
time I get a bright idea you'll be one,26.91,3.539,30.449,sad
of the very first to know about it now,28.5,4.59,33.09,sad
let's talk about the dawn phenomenon or,30.449,5.971,36.42,sad
the dawn effects so this I've heard a,33.09,6.809,39.899,fear
couple of experts miss describe this in,36.42,4.709,41.129000000000005,sad
the past few days and that's why I,39.899,3.18,43.079,sad
wanted to make a video so you guys would,41.129,4.321,45.449999999999996,sad
know exactly what's going on with the,43.079,4.05,47.129,sad
dawn effect I'm gonna call it that,45.45,3.359,48.809000000000005,sad
because that saves me some syllables in,47.129,4.95,52.079,sad
the course of this video so everyone,48.809,6.39,55.199,sad
when we're going from sleeping to waking,52.079,5.07,57.149,fear
right when you're waking up in the,55.199,3.691,58.89,fear
morning sometime between 2 a.m. and 8,57.149,5.371,62.52,sad
a.m. for most of us your body has to do,58.89,5.43,64.32,sad
things to actually wake you up and I,62.52,3.54,66.06,sad
know the alarm clock wakes most of you,64.32,2.97,67.28999999999999,sad
love but you're already in the process,66.06,3.3,69.36,sad
of waking up before the alarm clock goes,67.29,5.54,72.83000000000001,sad
off your body does this by increasing,69.36,7.049,76.409,sad
secretions of cortisol epinephrine which,72.83,5.98,78.81,sad
is adrenaline and nor epinephrine which,76.409,4.921,81.33000000000001,sad
is noradrenaline depending on if you're,78.81,4.739,83.549,sad
watching this from the US and Canada or,81.33,5.39,86.72,fear
the UK so there's a there's a temporal,83.549,6.231,89.78,sad
elevation of these three hormones and,86.72,5.74,92.46,sad
that makes your blood sugar go up a few,89.78,5.08,94.86,sad
points now I've heard experts say in the,92.46,4.11,96.57,sad
last few days that this happens only in,94.86,3.899,98.759,fear
diabetics which is absolutely not true,96.57,3.81,100.38,fear
to my knowledge it happens in every,98.759,3.451,102.21,fear
human on the face of the planet every,100.38,3.83,104.21,fear
morning and then I've also heard people,102.21,4.619,106.829,fear
imply that it only happens if you're,104.21,4.75,108.96,fear
eating a ketogenic diet which is also,106.829,4.711,111.53999999999999,fear
silly and untrue this happens to,108.96,4.86,113.82,sad
everyone when they're waking up and some,111.54,4.41,115.95,sad
of you may start a lake like Oh,113.82,4.439,118.25899999999999,sad
something scared me that's the,115.95,4.169,120.119,sad
adrenaline right in the cortisol and,118.259,4.201,122.46,sad
when that happens your blood sugar goes,120.119,5.64,125.759,sad
up anywhere from 5 to 25 points but it,122.46,4.769,127.229,sad
doesn't stay up it's only up for a,125.759,3.39,129.149,sad
little while and a lot of you have been,127.229,3.601,130.83,sad
checking a fasting blood sugar and,129.149,3.991,133.14000000000001,fear
that's how you've caught this this dawn,130.83,3.09,133.92000000000002,fear
effect,133.14,2.64,135.77999999999997,fear
right but then if you check again in an,133.92,3.48,137.39999999999998,sad
hour your blood Sugar's right back down,135.78,3.72,139.5,sad
to normal so there's no danger from this,137.4,3.78,141.18,sad
if you're a diabetic and you have this,139.5,3.84,143.34,sad
almost never should you adjust your,141.18,4.95,146.13,sad
medications based on this so don't worry,143.34,4.74,148.08,sad
about it just know about it and if,146.13,4.17,150.29999999999998,fear
you're using a glucometer - and sticking,148.08,3.96,152.04000000000002,fear
your finger watching your blood sugar,150.3,3.87,154.17000000000002,fear
carefully making sure that you don't,152.04,4.98,157.01999999999998,sad
have signs of hyperglycemia or insulin,154.17,5.73,159.89999999999998,sad
resistance then you'll know that's the,157.02,4.85,161.87,sad
dawn effect it's nothing to worry about,159.9,4.35,164.25,sad
like I said your blood sugar can go up,161.87,4.66,166.53,fear
anywhere from five to thirty points give,164.25,5.01,169.26,sad
or take depending on the person and it's,166.53,4.56,171.09,sad
not bad it's not dangerous there's,169.26,4.82,174.07999999999998,sad
nothing you need to do the amount of,171.09,5.13,176.22,sad
carbs that you've eaten the day before,174.08,4.42,178.5,sad
really don't have much of an effect on,176.22,4.89,181.10999999999999,sad
this at all and it's nothing to worry,178.5,4.739,183.239,sad
