don't you ever wish that people would,0.12,2.73,2.85,neutral
just make really simple videos for,1.319,3.361,4.68,neutral
really simple topics especially related,2.85,3.42,6.27,neutral
to health well I want to do that with,4.68,3.06,7.74,neutral
this video but make it short you make it,6.27,3.03,9.299999999999999,neutral
sweet make it straight to the point,7.74,3.54,11.280000000000001,neutral
we're talking about glycemic index vs.,9.3,3.299,12.599,neutral
glycemic load and this is probably,11.28,2.76,14.04,neutral
something you've wondered you've heard,12.599,2.851,15.45,neutral
glycemic index before you've heard,14.04,3.63,17.669999999999998,neutral
glycemic load but maybe you're even,15.45,4.53,19.98,neutral
afraid to ask like what the heck is it,17.67,3.48,21.150000000000002,neutral
and what's the difference so let's just,19.98,2.549,22.529,fear
make it really simple for you okay it,21.15,3.33,24.479999999999997,neutral
all comes down to how carbohydrates,22.529,4.17,26.698999999999998,neutral
react within our bodies and what they do,24.48,4.17,28.65,neutral

description that's an online grocery,37.5,3.45,40.95,neutral
store so I'm able to put like all my,39.239,4.291,43.53,neutral
keto boxes my fasting boxes all,40.95,4.05,45.0,
groceries that I would normally get I,43.53,3.36,46.89,
can consolidate them into like an online,45.0,4.2,49.2,neutral
grocery box that you guys can therefore,46.89,4.38,51.27,neutral
go and order so that way you utilize the,49.2,3.21,52.410000000000004,neutral
right market get groceries delivered,51.27,2.76,54.03,
right to your doorstep so please do,52.41,3.03,55.44,
check them out after you watch this,54.03,3.509,57.539,neutral
video super awesome deals there so,55.44,5.639,61.079,neutral
glycemic index is how quickly a fixed,57.539,6.48,64.019,neutral
amount of food or carbohydrates get,61.079,5.851,66.93,neutral
converted into glucose okay so yes if,64.019,5.881,69.9,neutral
you have one specific amount how quickly,66.93,5.34,72.27000000000001,neutral
does that elevate your blood sugar and,69.9,4.38,74.28,neutral
get converted into glucose okay so for,72.27,5.07,77.34,neutral
example glucose is 100 it's the highest,74.28,5.55,79.83,neutral
point that you can get to so for example,77.34,7.86,85.2,
wheat bread is a 75 okay carrots are a,79.83,10.38,90.21,
40 broccoli is a 15 and eggs are a zero,85.2,7.2,92.4,
it's just that's just how you measure,90.21,5.1,95.30999999999999,
sort of the carbohydrate glucose density,92.4,4.77,97.17,
of something but here's something pretty,95.31,3.48,98.79,
interesting so the American Journal of,97.17,3.57,100.74,
Clinical Nutrition published a study it,98.79,3.99,102.78,
was done out of Harvard took a look at,100.74,5.43,106.16999999999999,neutral
12 men gave them nearly identical meals,102.78,5.1,107.88,neutral
ok so literally they ate the same meal,106.17,4.409,110.57900000000001,
same calories the same macronutrient,107.88,5.04,112.92,
same proteins fats and carbs the only,110.579,6.091,116.66999999999999,
difference was the glycemic index was 37,112.92,6.989,119.909,
in one group and was 84 in another okay,116.67,5.4,122.07000000000001,
so high glycemic versus low glycemic the,119.909,3.99,123.899,
participants didn't even know their food,122.07,4.439,126.50899999999999,neutral
was different okay now what they found,123.899,4.621,128.52,neutral
is that the high glycemic index caused a,126.509,4.051,130.56,neutral
big blood sugar spike and then a strong,128.52,5.16,133.68,neutral
dip below baseline three hours later,130.56,4.62,135.18,neutral
but when they looked at their brains,133.68,4.41,138.09,neutral
under fMRI they found that the nucleus,135.18,5.699,140.87900000000002,
accumbens was lit up like a Christmas,138.09,4.95,143.04,
tree okay the nucleus accumbens is the,140.879,4.11,144.989,neutral
part that is associated with addiction,143.04,4.71,147.75,neutral
so we definitely saw that even when food,144.989,4.621,149.61,neutral
tastes the same higher glycemic index,147.75,3.359,151.109,neutral
will make you more addicted to it so,149.61,3.329,152.93900000000002,neutral
that's why you want to avoid high,151.109,3.481,154.59,neutral
glycemic foods you want to go low GI,152.939,4.231,157.17,neutral
even if it's comparable foods otherwise,154.59,6.3,160.89000000000001,neutral
now what's glycemic load okay see people,157.17,5.25,162.42,
interchange them and they get them mixed,160.89,4.11,165.0,
up class emic load is how much a non,162.42,5.489,167.909,neutral
fixed amount affects your blood glucose,165.0,4.019,169.019,neutral
okay,167.909,4.321,172.23,
so again it's basically our glycemic,169.019,5.97,174.989,
index multiplied by how much you eat so,172.23,4.289,176.51899999999998,
we use that same example of wheat bread,174.989,3.931,178.92000000000002,
wheat bread is no matter what going to,176.519,4.381,180.9,
be a 75 whether you eat one piece of,178.92,4.17,183.08999999999997,neutral
wheat bread or hundred pieces of wheat,180.9,5.399,186.299,neutral
bread it's still the same glycemic index,183.09,4.83,187.92000000000002,neutral
it still spikes your blood sugar at the,186.299,4.34,190.639,neutral
same rate of speed but glycemic load,187.92,6.06,193.98,neutral
ends up factoring in how much of it,190.639,5.591,196.23000000000002,
there is so in this case we read times,193.98,5.909,199.88899999999998,neutral
to still 75 GI but two times the load,196.23,6.599,202.82899999999998,neutral
okay the best way to compare it is like,199.889,5.581,205.47,neutral
caloric density we say we look at one,202.829,4.321,207.15,neutral
piece of food compared to another and we,205.47,3.0,208.47,NA
say oh well that's more calorically,207.15,3.54,210.69,NA
dense than the other so a simple thing,208.47,5.46,213.93,NA
and be like a square of butter might,210.69,5.99,216.68,NA
have just as many calories as an entire,213.93,6.089,220.019,NA
steak okay but it's because the butter,216.68,6.369,223.049,NA
is more calorically dense than the steak,220.019,5.94,225.959,NA
right so it's all about balancing this,223.049,5.25,228.299,NA
glycemic index in this glycemic load so,225.959,3.93,229.889,NA
when you look at like Simic a load at,228.299,3.87,232.169,NA
that number you want to understand well,229.889,5.07,234.959,NA
how much of this food is making how much,232.169,4.74,236.90900000000002,NA
of an impact in my body so you should,234.959,3.601,238.56,NA
always look at glycemic index and,236.909,4.26,241.16899999999998,NA
glycemic load because this can carry you,238.56,4.889,243.449,NA
over for a longer period of time anyhow,241.169,4.32,245.489,NA
that's a basic understanding of it hope,243.449,3.75,247.199,NA
that helped cleared some simple science,245.489,3.271,248.76,NA
up for you and make sure you're coming,247.199,3.18,250.37900000000002,NA
back here every single day because we've,248.76,3.629,252.38899999999998,NA
got new videos at 7:30 a.m. Pacific time,250.379,5.57,255.94899999999998,NA
every day see you tomorrow,252.389,3.56,255.949,NA
