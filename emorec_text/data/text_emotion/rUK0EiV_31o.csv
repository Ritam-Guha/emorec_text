"Well hello everyone and welcome back to my
channel, or if you are new,
hello welcome to my channel, my name is Sophie. Gastroparesis is a *BEEP* lets be honest. And there sadly isn’t ‘safe’ options
when it comes to food. There are safe-er options but these still
come with consequences…",15.12,21.198999999999998,36.318999999999996,angry
"at least for me anyway. I recently saw a nutritionist or dietician,
is there a difference between the two? I don’t know. But she actually made quite a lot of sense
in what she said. Now in my many years of Gastroparesis,
I have certainly been through my fair share",36.319,19.66,55.979,neutral
"of nutritionists and they’ve basically told
me what foods to avoid, and that i can’t ear anything besides water
pretty much. This lady actually told me what I CAN eat
to try and reduce those symptoms. It’s not a cure and it’s still going to
come with some consequences, but it tries to reduce the symptoms whilst
giving you a balanced diet",55.979,22.191,78.17,angry
"which is what I have really really struggled
with over the years. And whilst there are foods that do take longer
to digest and therefore give more symptoms, it is all about having things in moderation. Another interesting thing that I learnt from
her was that different foods actually digest differently
when eaten together than when eaten alone.",78.17,23.57,101.74000000000001,angry
"Puuuuuffff…. Mind Blown. Let me give you an example;
Bananas. I do love me a good banana,
however bananas do have a lot of fibre in. And whilst this is good for your body,
fibre is harder to break down,",101.74,13.600000000000001,115.34,angry
"especially with Gastroparesis. So when you eat them alone,
they take longer to digest and therefore can give more pain,
more nausea, and even lead to constipation. However,
if you add some almonds,",115.34,12.26,127.60000000000001,angry
"*pronounces differently* almonds…
al-monds… almonds…
into the mix, the two combined digest completely differently
and are then actually really good for you. Almonds can actually help aid digestion. Bet you didn’t know that one.",127.6,18.32,145.92,angry
"A lot of nutritionist have told me to avoid
fresh fruits where possible because of the sugars in them,
and they take longer to digest in terms of breaking down that sugar. And because of our stomach they sit there
for longer and they can rot and they can even lead to stomach infections.",145.92,16.78,162.7,angry

I’ve been there. It ain’t pleasant. It hurts. And it stinks because it gives you really
really .. really..
bad wind.",162.7,10.459,173.159,neutral

out because it smells so bad. Sorry mum and dad. But…
if you add a hard boiled egg with that fresh fruit.. BAMMMM….",173.159,11.16,184.319,angry
"different story all together. Something to do with the protein in the egg…
and the fruit…. I’m not a scientist,
I’m not a nutritionist, I don’t know the in depth reasoning for
these things. And I know that when you look up online it
does tell you certain things,",184.319,18.009999999999998,202.32899999999998,neutral
"some of the things on there will vary for
people with Gastroparesis because of the rate our body digests at anyway. But,
it is definitely worth asking your nutritionist. And obviously,
everybody is different. every person reacts to things differently.",202.329,16.101,218.43,angry

you probably have no idea what I’m talking about. But who remembers that advert? Or is it still on?",228.93,7.959,236.889,angry
"I don’t really watch TV anymore. Now there are still things that are better
to avoid just because they don’t digest very well. I was told to avoid peanuts still and rather
stick to tree nuts like almonds, cashews, walnuts,
because they can actually help aid digestion",236.889,17.86,254.74900000000002,angry

great.",254.749,10.770999999999999,265.52,angry

told by my mum, by my doctors,
by my Gastroparesis specialist, by like literally everyone,
is that you should have small meals little and often.",276.25,14.840000000000002,291.09,neutral
"Everyone is actually supposed to do this. You’re supposed to have 6 smaller meals
rather than 3 larger meals. But i mean…
ain’t nobody got time for that so everyone does it the wrong way basically. And there’s two reasons for…
particularly in Gastroparesis why you should",291.09,15.71,306.79999999999995,neutral
"do this. The first one is,
If you give you stomach a huge meal to digest it basically goes..
ajkhfsajfdfvihs.. What do I do with food..
i can’t even speak because my body is just like…
big meal….",306.8,12.17,318.97,angry
"NOOOO…. Basically it just makes your stomach go into
complete like.. OMG How do i digest this all. And it just spasms. And the second reason for this is because
by eating little bits of food regularly,",318.97,14.919999999999998,333.89000000000004,angry
"it actually helps to speed up your metabolism
because it encourages digestion. So,
little and often is the key for anyone in life but particularly if you have Gastroparesis. And that one,
you will see a difference. Because the more you eat,
the more pain you’re going to be in,",333.89,17.37,351.26,angry
"or the more you’re going to throw up. Or the more likely you are to throw up. Yes,
Gastroparesis has a mind of its own, and some days it will just do it even at the
smell of food. But you can try and help encourage it,
and if you’re encouraging your body maybe",351.26,14.93,366.19,neutral

I’m hoping, my body will be like,
oh, i’m gonna,
I’m gonna do what that’s telling me to do. And it might actually do the normal human
thing.",366.19,8.43,374.62,NA
"I can hope. For me personally,
I don’t have any Gluten just because that when I do have gluten I do get very bloated. which in turn causes more pain. So i do tend to stick to a gluten free diet.",374.62,13.42,388.04,neutral
"I also don’t have dairy very much. Like a bit of chocolate or a bit of cheese
is ok. because i wouldn’t go and have a glass of
milk, a yoghurt, ice cream, that sort of thing because it just makes me
feel really sick and unwell. And that is because gluten and dairy are actually
very hard for the stomach to digest.",388.04,18.15,406.19,neutral
"In small amounts,
yes for some people. I am gluten intolerant so for me personally,
I can tolerate like a little bit in a sauce or something,
but give me a sandwich or pasta, me and my body ain’t gonna be very happy
basically. I also find red meats are harder to digest.",406.19,18.880000000000003,425.07,angry
"And that is because they are fattier and they
do just take longer for the body to digest, so i get more pain,
so i tend to avoid it for the most part. I tend to stick to chicken, turkey, tuna,
salmon. They are all very good for your body. They are easy to digest.",425.07,17.049999999999997,442.12,angry

your body needs which is always really handy. Those for me are the ‘easiest’ on my stomach. Most the time… Sometimes…

nice to me.",442.12,16.740000000000002,458.86,neutral
