thirty million people in the United,0.0,3.36,3.36,happy
States have diabetes the vast majority,1.56,4.38,5.9399999999999995,happy
of them have type 2 diabetes some of,3.36,4.439,7.7989999999999995,fear
those are testing their blood sugar at,5.94,4.05,9.99,happy
home but the best research is telling us,7.799,3.96,11.759,happy
that they don't need do that in fact,9.99,3.72,13.71,fear
it's a waste of money it's not a small,11.759,4.05,15.809000000000001,fear
problem the waste is running into the,13.71,4.23,17.94,fear
billions of dollars and it's costing all,15.809,3.451,19.259999999999998,fear
of us money through the healthcare,17.94,3.599,21.539,
system that's the topic of this week's,19.26,10.8,30.060000000000002,
healthcare triage for people with type 1,21.539,10.77,32.309,
diabetes blood glucose monitoring and,30.06,4.53,34.589999999999996,
insulin administration is the standard,32.309,4.261,36.57,
of care patients need to check their,34.59,3.989,38.579,
blood sugar multiple times a day then,36.57,4.02,40.59,
give themselves insulin to replace what,38.579,3.171,41.75,
would have been made in the pancreas,40.59,3.809,44.399,
treatment for type 2 diabetes however,41.75,4.51,46.26,
doesn't involve these critical,44.399,3.66,48.059,
calculations of insulin it's usually,46.26,3.27,49.53,
maintained with pretty regular,48.059,3.301,51.36,
administration of the same drugs on a,49.53,3.9,53.43,
set schedule self-monitoring for blood,51.36,5.1,56.46,
glucose therefore may be unnecessary for,53.43,5.28,58.71,
those not on insulin this has been,56.46,4.349,60.809,
tested in well-designed studies the,58.71,3.899,62.609,
monitor trial published two years ago in,60.809,3.93,64.739,
JAMA internal medicine was a pragmatic,62.609,4.561,67.17,
trial that took place in 15 primary care,64.739,4.74,69.479,
practices in North Carolina patients,67.17,4.559,71.729,
with type 2 non insulin treated diabetes,69.479,3.811,73.28999999999999,
were randomly assigned to one of three,71.729,3.871,75.6,
groups people in the first group were,73.29,4.079,77.369,
told to check their blood glucose once a,75.6,4.32,79.91999999999999,
day people in the second were told to,77.369,4.201,81.57,
check their blood glucose once a day and,79.92,3.269,83.18900000000001,
then they were given tailored advice,81.57,3.27,84.83999999999999,
depending on the results from the meter,83.189,4.411,87.6,
the third group was told not to check,84.84,5.099,89.93900000000001,
their blood sugar at all after one year,87.6,4.08,91.67999999999999,
which is a pretty impressive length for,89.939,3.421,93.36,
a study like this there were no,91.68,4.259,95.93900000000001,
differences in the hemoglobin a1c levels,93.36,4.02,97.38,
which is the best way to monitor,95.939,3.72,99.65899999999999,
long-term blood glucose control between,97.38,3.779,101.15899999999999,
the three groups there were also no,99.659,2.67,102.32900000000001,
differences in the health-related,101.159,2.85,104.009,
quality of life measures for the,102.329,3.33,105.65899999999999,
patients there were no differences in,104.009,3.031,107.04,
the number of times they experience,105.659,3.39,109.049,
hypoglycemia how much care they needed,107.04,3.93,110.97000000000001,
and how many progressed to the need for,109.049,4.32,113.369,
insulin in other words there were no,110.97,4.2,115.17,
measurable differences in how patients,113.369,3.811,117.18,
fared whether they check blood sugar or,115.17,4.11,119.28,
not this evidence while the best to date,117.18,5.06,122.24000000000001,
confirm what previous work had shown a,119.28,5.909,125.18900000000001,
2012 Cochrane review assessed all the,122.24,4.36,126.6,
randomized controlled trials through,125.189,4.261,129.45,
2011 that had investigated how testing,126.6,4.409,131.009,
for blood glucose at home improved,129.45,4.5,133.95,fear
outcomes it included 12 trials,131.009,6.031,137.04,fear
involving more than 3200 patients by 12,133.95,5.16,139.10999999999999,fear
months the overall benefit to testing,137.04,3.87,140.91,fear
with respect to lab values was,139.11,4.62,143.73000000000002,
statistically insignificant there were,140.91,4.86,145.77,
never any benefits with respect to,143.73,4.56,148.29,
patient satisfaction still not everyone,145.77,4.92,150.69,
is on board critics of this most recent,148.29,4.02,152.31,
trial said it didn't prove that blood,150.69,4.14,154.82999999999998,
glucose monitoring couldn't help it's,152.31,4.83,157.14000000000001,
possible to with better training or more,154.83,4.44,159.27,
attention to detail there might be ways,157.14,4.11,161.25,
to make it work the point of pragmatic,159.27,3.33,162.60000000000002,
comparative effectiveness trials though,161.25,3.09,164.34,
which we've covered in previous episodes,162.6,4.08,166.68,
is to test how practices work in the,164.34,5.28,169.62,happy
real world in these high-quality primary,166.68,5.67,172.35,happy
care practices even with customized help,169.62,4.53,174.15,happy
in interpreting the measurements which,172.35,4.41,176.76,happy
is more than most patients get testing,174.15,3.899,178.049,happy
blood sugar didn't make a difference,176.76,3.42,180.17999999999998,
choosing wisely we've covered it before,178.049,4.561,182.61,
is an educational campaign aiming to,180.18,4.29,184.47,
reduce unnecessary medical tests and,182.61,4.349,186.959,
procedures and it advises against,184.47,4.68,189.15,
routine home glucose monitoring for,186.959,4.231,191.19,
patients with type 2 diabetes who are,189.15,4.2,193.35,
not on insulin it says that there is no,191.19,4.56,195.75,
benefit admit there are potential harms,193.35,3.99,197.34,
like an association with increased,195.75,3.45,199.2,
anxiety this argument is supported by,197.34,3.209,200.549,
the American Academy of Family,199.2,3.36,202.56,
Physicians the Society of general,200.549,3.901,204.45000000000002,
internal medicine and The Endocrine,202.56,3.84,206.4,
Society of course there are exceptions,204.45,3.87,208.32,
when patients are acutely ill or,206.4,3.66,210.06,
changing regimens or finding that their,208.32,2.93,211.25,
blood sugar is not well controlled,210.06,3.54,213.6,
testing may be appropriate such,211.25,4.299,215.549,
decisions should be made in consultation,213.6,4.62,218.22,
with a physician but for most people,215.549,4.681,220.23000000000002,
with type 2 diabetes not an insulin,218.22,4.62,222.84,happy
testing is inappropriate most of the,220.23,5.22,225.45,happy
time that message is not getting through,222.84,5.22,228.06,happy
at the end of last year another study,225.45,3.87,229.32,happy
was published in JAMA internal medicine,228.06,3.149,231.209,happy
that quantified the prevalence of,229.32,4.199,233.519,
glucose testing and adults researchers,231.209,4.201,235.41,
examined a database that contain data on,233.519,3.121,236.64000000000001,
more than three hundred and seventy,235.41,3.21,238.62,

type 2 diabetes of the more than 23,240.78,3.72,244.5,happy
percent of patients who were using,243.239,3.601,246.84,happy
testing strips more than half were,244.5,4.44,248.94,happy
probably doing so in spite of widespread,246.84,3.959,250.799,happy
recommendations that they should not,248.94,4.799,253.739,
they were using a median of two testing,250.799,4.861,255.66,
strips a day at a cost of more than,253.739,3.03,256.769,
three hundred and twenty-five dollars,255.66,4.109,259.769,
per year per patient on another front,256.769,4.861,261.63,
the New York Times and other places have,259.769,3.421,263.19,fear
reported that a surprisingly large,261.63,3.9,265.53,
number of people who use insulin,263.19,4.95,268.14,
are using less because they can't afford,265.53,5.52,271.04999999999995,
it putting themselves in danger with a,268.14,4.65,272.78999999999996,
healthcare system as complicated as ours,271.05,3.72,274.77000000000004,
it's hard to take money from one pot and,272.79,4.35,277.14000000000004,happy
shifted easily to another efficiency and,274.77,4.74,279.51,happy
each system is crucial the fact that a,277.14,4.56,281.7,fear
necessary facet of diabetes care is,279.51,4.05,283.56,happy
increasingly out of reach,281.7,4.14,285.84,happy
while unnecessary and potentially,283.56,4.28,287.84,happy
harmful care is easily overused,285.84,4.62,290.46,happy
illustrates how much work still needs to,287.84,2.95,290.78999999999996,happy
