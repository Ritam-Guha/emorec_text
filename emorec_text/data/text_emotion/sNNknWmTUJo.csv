hi guys in this video I want to talk,0.0,3.659,3.659,surprise
about why diabetics tend to get high,1.319,4.951,6.27,surprise
blood pressure okay well first of all if,3.659,4.77,8.428999999999998,surprise
you're a type 2 diabetic you have,6.27,4.59,10.86,surprise
insulin resistance which means you have,8.429,5.34,13.769,surprise
higher levels of insulin okay so what,10.86,5.279,16.139,surprise
happens the insulin is not working so,13.769,3.991,17.76,sad
you have to take metformin or glucophage,16.139,3.931,20.07,sad
to be able to get the receptor to obsess,17.76,5.67,23.43,surprise
accept insulin but then on the other,20.07,4.89,24.96,surprise
hand because there's no return,23.43,3.48,26.91,sad
communication to the pancreas the,24.96,4.35,29.310000000000002,sad
feedback loops you get increased insulin,26.91,5.34,32.25,sad
by five to seven times a normal person,29.31,5.22,34.53,surprise
if you want others to understand more of,32.25,3.54,35.79,surprise
that I put a link down below but the,34.53,3.42,37.95,happy
point is that diabetics type to have,35.79,4.589,40.379,surprise
higher levels of insulin which then,37.95,5.91,43.86,surprise
cause the retention of sodium okay which,40.379,5.551,45.93,happy
then caused the retention of water so,43.86,4.62,48.48,sad
they have edema swelling and yes also,45.93,4.949,50.879,surprise
increase insulin increases inflammation,48.48,5.419,53.898999999999994,surprise
in the arteries as well as certain,50.879,5.45,56.329,sad
constriction in the tone of the vessels,53.899,4.451,58.35,surprise
but the point is that the main thing,56.329,4.0,60.329,surprise
will do is a cause retention of sodium,58.35,4.59,62.94,surprise
retention of fluid increased blood,60.329,5.61,65.93900000000001,surprise
pressure that's that's the mechanism now,62.94,4.77,67.71,surprise
the treatment of course is to go on a,65.939,4.47,70.40899999999999,happy
low salt diet right well what's gonna,67.71,4.5,72.21,sad
happen if you lower salt you still,70.409,4.381,74.79,sad
haven't fixed the high insulin so now,72.21,5.61,77.82,surprise
you create a sodium deficiency so you're,74.79,6.17,80.96000000000001,surprise
going to get weakness fatigue constant,77.82,5.85,83.66999999999999,surprise
constipation things like that because,80.96,5.08,86.03999999999999,surprise
you need a certain amount of sodium for,83.67,4.949,88.619,surprise
a nerve and muscle function and then,86.04,4.619,90.659,happy
there's you put on medication usually a,88.619,5.011,93.63,happy
diuretic which then has a side effect of,90.659,6.301,96.96000000000001,sad
lowering potassium well guess what,93.63,5.94,99.57,sad
if you lower potassium which normally,96.96,4.32,101.28,sad
lowers blood pressure you're going to,99.57,3.869,103.439,sad
increase the relative ratio of higher,101.28,4.949,106.229,sad
sodium when you because potassium and,103.439,4.89,108.329,happy
sodium work together so you don't want,106.229,3.721,109.95,happy
to lose any more potassium from your,108.329,3.9,112.229,surprise
body in fact one of the best things you,109.95,3.27,113.22,surprise
could do if you're diabetic has,112.229,3.18,115.409,surprise
increased more potassium from the diet a,113.22,4.14,117.36,fear
lot of vegetables and even even as a,115.409,3.721,119.13000000000001,fear
supplement as well when you can improve,117.36,3.09,120.45,fear
the situation so you don't want to,119.13,4.26,123.39,fear
necessarily restrict sodium too much and,120.45,4.32,124.77000000000001,neutral
then also another side effect from the,123.39,4.29,127.68,fear
diuretic is insulin resistance which,124.77,6.12,130.89,happy
will increase more insulin,127.68,5.37,133.05,happy
so the medication in dips ends up,130.89,4.29,135.17999999999998,sad
aggravating the condition in making it,133.05,5.52,138.57000000000002,sad
worse okay why because it's not treating,135.18,5.01,140.19,sad
the underlying cause in sort of,138.57,4.8,143.37,happy
resistance so here's what do you do what,140.19,4.98,145.17,sad
you want to do is get on a keto program,143.37,3.48,146.85,sad
I put a link down below which is,145.17,2.58,147.75,sad
basically going to reduce your,146.85,2.73,149.57999999999998,fear
carbohydrates which will then reduce,147.75,4.2,151.95,sad
your need for insulin which will then,149.58,4.29,153.87,sad
reduce the need for retention of sodium,151.95,4.02,155.97,sad
and you'll find that you'll lose your,153.87,4.589,158.459,fear
fluid you'll actually have normal,155.97,3.87,159.84,happy
balance of sodium and you probably have,158.459,3.781,162.24,happy
to consume more sodium because you'll,159.84,4.8,164.64000000000001,happy
you won't retain it anymore okay,162.24,4.41,166.65,sad
so I watched those links down below and,164.64,5.58,170.22,sad
let me know what you think hey you,166.65,4.95,171.6,surprise
