hi guys in this video I want to talk about why diabetics tend to get high blood pressure okay well first of all if you're a type 2 diabetic you have insulin resistance which means you have,0.0,23.31,23.31,angry
higher levels of insulin okay so what happens the insulin is not working so you have to take metformin or glucophage to be able to get the receptor to obsess accept insulin but then on the other,10.86,23.761000000000003,34.621,angry
hand because there's no return communication to the pancreas the feedback loops you get increased insulin by five to seven times a normal person if you want others to understand more of,23.43,21.93,45.36,angry
that I put a link down below but the point is that diabetics type to have higher levels of insulin which then cause the retention of sodium okay which then caused the retention of water so,34.53,24.09,58.620000000000005,angry
they have edema swelling and yes also increase insulin increases inflammation in the arteries as well as certain constriction in the tone of the vessels but the point is that the main thing,45.93,24.269,70.199,angry
will do is a cause retention of sodium retention of fluid increased blood pressure that's that's the mechanism now the treatment of course is to go on a low salt diet right well what's gonna,58.35,23.939999999999998,82.28999999999999,angry
happen if you lower salt you still haven't fixed the high insulin so now you create a sodium deficiency so you're going to get weakness fatigue constant constipation things like that because,70.409,27.091,97.5,angry
you need a certain amount of sodium for a nerve and muscle function and then there's you put on medication usually a diuretic which then has a side effect of lowering potassium well guess what,83.67,26.820000000000004,110.49000000000001,sad
if you lower potassium which normally lowers blood pressure you're going to increase the relative ratio of higher sodium when you because potassium and sodium work together so you don't want,96.96,21.749,118.70899999999999,angry
to lose any more potassium from your body in fact one of the best things you could do if you're diabetic has increased more potassium from the diet a lot of vegetables and even even as a,108.329,18.211,126.53999999999999,angry
supplement as well when you can improve the situation so you don't want to necessarily restrict sodium too much and then also another side effect from the diuretic is insulin resistance which,117.36,22.080000000000002,139.44,angry
will increase more insulin so the medication in dips ends up aggravating the condition in making it worse okay why because it's not treating the underlying cause in sort of,127.68,24.99,152.67000000000002,angry
resistance so here's what do you do what you want to do is get on a keto program I put a link down below which is basically going to reduce your carbohydrates which will then reduce,140.19,17.970000000000002,158.16,angry
your need for insulin which will then reduce the need for retention of sodium and you'll find that you'll lose your fluid you'll actually have normal balance of sodium and you probably have,149.58,20.549999999999997,170.13,angry
to consume more sodium because you'll you won't retain it anymore okay so I watched those links down below and let me know what you think hey you probably already subscribed but if you,159.84,22.740000000000002,182.58,angry
haven't press this little button down below and I will keep you updated,171.6,9.34,180.94,neutral
