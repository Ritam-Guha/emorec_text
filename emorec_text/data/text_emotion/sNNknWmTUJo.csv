hi guys in this video I want to talk,0.0,3.659,3.659,
about why diabetics tend to get high,1.319,4.951,6.27,
blood pressure okay well first of all if,3.659,4.77,8.428999999999998,
you're a type 2 diabetic you have,6.27,4.59,10.86,
insulin resistance which means you have,8.429,5.34,13.769,surprise
higher levels of insulin okay so what,10.86,5.279,16.139,surprise
happens the insulin is not working so,13.769,3.991,17.76,fear
you have to take metformin or glucophage,16.139,3.931,20.07,neutral
to be able to get the receptor to obsess,17.76,5.67,23.43,surprise
accept insulin but then on the other,20.07,4.89,24.96,surprise
hand because there's no return,23.43,3.48,26.91,neutral
communication to the pancreas the,24.96,4.35,29.310000000000002,neutral
feedback loops you get increased insulin,26.91,5.34,32.25,fear
by five to seven times a normal person,29.31,5.22,34.53,surprise
if you want others to understand more of,32.25,3.54,35.79,surprise
that I put a link down below but the,34.53,3.42,37.95,
point is that diabetics type to have,35.79,4.589,40.379,surprise
higher levels of insulin which then,37.95,5.91,43.86,surprise
cause the retention of sodium okay which,40.379,5.551,45.93,neutral
then caused the retention of water so,43.86,4.62,48.48,neutral
they have edema swelling and yes also,45.93,4.949,50.879,surprise
increase insulin increases inflammation,48.48,5.419,53.898999999999994,surprise
in the arteries as well as certain,50.879,5.45,56.329,neutral
constriction in the tone of the vessels,53.899,4.451,58.35,surprise
but the point is that the main thing,56.329,4.0,60.329,surprise
will do is a cause retention of sodium,58.35,4.59,62.94,surprise
retention of fluid increased blood,60.329,5.61,65.93900000000001,surprise
pressure that's that's the mechanism now,62.94,4.77,67.71,surprise
the treatment of course is to go on a,65.939,4.47,70.40899999999999,neutral
low salt diet right well what's gonna,67.71,4.5,72.21,neutral
happen if you lower salt you still,70.409,4.381,74.79,neutral
haven't fixed the high insulin so now,72.21,5.61,77.82,surprise
you create a sodium deficiency so you're,74.79,6.17,80.96000000000001,surprise
going to get weakness fatigue constant,77.82,5.85,83.66999999999999,surprise
constipation things like that because,80.96,5.08,86.03999999999999,surprise
you need a certain amount of sodium for,83.67,4.949,88.619,surprise
a nerve and muscle function and then,86.04,4.619,90.659,
there's you put on medication usually a,88.619,5.011,93.63,
diuretic which then has a side effect of,90.659,6.301,96.96000000000001,neutral
lowering potassium well guess what,93.63,5.94,99.57,neutral
if you lower potassium which normally,96.96,4.32,101.28,neutral
lowers blood pressure you're going to,99.57,3.869,103.439,neutral
increase the relative ratio of higher,101.28,4.949,106.229,neutral
sodium when you because potassium and,103.439,4.89,108.329,neutral
sodium work together so you don't want,106.229,3.721,109.95,
to lose any more potassium from your,108.329,3.9,112.229,surprise
body in fact one of the best things you,109.95,3.27,113.22,surprise
could do if you're diabetic has,112.229,3.18,115.409,surprise
increased more potassium from the diet a,113.22,4.14,117.36,neutral
lot of vegetables and even even as a,115.409,3.721,119.13000000000001,neutral
supplement as well when you can improve,117.36,3.09,120.45,fear
the situation so you don't want to,119.13,4.26,123.39,neutral
necessarily restrict sodium too much and,120.45,4.32,124.77000000000001,neutral
then also another side effect from the,123.39,4.29,127.68,neutral
diuretic is insulin resistance which,124.77,6.12,130.89,neutral
will increase more insulin,127.68,5.37,133.05,neutral
so the medication in dips ends up,130.89,4.29,135.17999999999998,
aggravating the condition in making it,133.05,5.52,138.57000000000002,neutral
worse okay why because it's not treating,135.18,5.01,140.19,neutral
the underlying cause in sort of,138.57,4.8,143.37,neutral
resistance so here's what do you do what,140.19,4.98,145.17,
you want to do is get on a keto program,143.37,3.48,146.85,neutral
I put a link down below which is,145.17,2.58,147.75,neutral
basically going to reduce your,146.85,2.73,149.57999999999998,neutral
carbohydrates which will then reduce,147.75,4.2,151.95,neutral
your need for insulin which will then,149.58,4.29,153.87,neutral
reduce the need for retention of sodium,151.95,4.02,155.97,neutral
and you'll find that you'll lose your,153.87,4.589,158.459,neutral
fluid you'll actually have normal,155.97,3.87,159.84,neutral
balance of sodium and you probably have,158.459,3.781,162.24,neutral
to consume more sodium because you'll,159.84,4.8,164.64000000000001,
you won't retain it anymore okay,162.24,4.41,166.65,
so I watched those links down below and,164.64,5.58,170.22,neutral
let me know what you think hey you,166.65,4.95,171.6,neutral
probably already subscribed but if you,170.22,3.0,173.22,neutral
haven't press this little button down,171.6,5.48,177.07999999999998,neutral
below and I will keep you updated,173.22,3.86,177.08,neutral
