so I had a question from someone that,0.03,3.24,3.27,neutral
was on metformin because they were a,1.62,3.57,5.1899999999999995,neutral
diabetic and they wanted to know is that,3.27,4.2,7.470000000000001,neutral
gonna bump me out of ketosis is it gonna,5.19,4.67,9.86,neutral
prevent me getting into ketosis,7.47,5.85,13.32,fear
well metformin is used for type 2,9.86,5.319,15.178999999999998,fear
diabetes is also used for polycystic,13.32,5.16,18.48,fear
ovarian syndrome and it doesn't increase,15.179,6.6,21.779,neutral
insulin like other diabetic medications,18.48,6.389,24.869,neutral
do it basically focuses on the insulin,21.779,6.481,28.259999999999998,neutral
receptor okay so it targets insulin,24.869,6.691,31.56,neutral
resistance it allows the insulin to be,28.26,5.61,33.870000000000005,neutral
more efficient and to work better in the,31.56,4.92,36.48,neutral
body okay so that sounds good,33.87,5.67,39.54,neutral
it sounds like a great strategy doctors,36.48,5.25,41.73,fear
say it's safe you know it's all the,39.54,4.74,44.28,neutral
medications it's at least damaging then,41.73,5.97,47.699999999999996,neutral
why do they put a black box warning on,44.28,7.14,51.42,NA
this medication okay I mean in order to,47.7,6.179,53.879000000000005,NA
put a black box warning there has to be,51.42,6.45,57.870000000000005,fear
some serious side effects there is small,53.879,7.741,61.62,fear
but fatal lactic acidosis risk okay so,57.87,5.849,63.718999999999994,fear
there's a small risk that you may,61.62,4.71,66.33,fear
develop lactic acidosis and there's a,63.719,5.01,68.729,fear
complication that you may die but it's a,66.33,3.78,70.11,fear
small risk so they have to put this,68.729,4.531,73.26,fear
black box warning so what is lactic,70.11,6.66,76.77,fear
acidosis well it's a condition where you,73.26,5.429,78.68900000000001,fear
become hypoxic you you decrease your,76.77,5.31,82.08,NA
oxygen absorption to the cells your pH,78.689,5.97,84.65899999999999,fear
becomes more acidic in the blood you get,82.08,5.1,87.17999999999999,fear
tired electrical problems with the heart,84.659,5.46,90.119,fear
like an electrolytes you can have heart,87.18,7.079,94.259,fear

what you need to know right here severe,103.079,6.591,109.66999999999999,NA
lactic acidosis can be reversed by,106.17,7.8,113.97,NA
thiamine that's vitamin b1 within 24,109.67,6.76,116.43,fear
hours I'll put the data down below you,113.97,5.46,119.42999999999999,fear

solution to a very major problem okay b1,119.43,8.46,127.89000000000001,fear
you also need to know this metformin,124.009,7.361,131.37,fear
inhibits be warned transportation so,127.89,5.819,133.709,fear
basically it blocks b1,131.37,4.589,135.959,fear
the more you take metformin the more you,133.709,4.351,138.06,fear
depleted with b1 the more you're,135.959,3.661,139.62,fear
deficient the more you're gonna have,138.06,4.62,142.68,fear
lactic acidosis it's kind of crazy so,139.62,5.1,144.72,fear
you need to know that like if you're,142.68,3.54,146.22,fear
taking that form and you want to take it,144.72,4.469,149.189,fear
you better be taking b1 the ideal scene,146.22,6.329,152.549,fear
is to just do healthy keto and then I'm,149.189,4.711,153.9,fear
gonna fasting to the point where you,152.549,3.631,156.18,fear
don't need this anymore now the other,153.9,4.47,158.37,fear
interesting thing is this there's,156.18,4.29,160.47,fear
certain contraindications for taking,158.37,4.64,163.01,NA
that form in the first place if you have,160.47,5.189,165.659,NA

you to take that form in because it will,168.329,4.08,172.40900000000002,NA
increase the risk of eating a lot again,170.639,5.13,175.769,fear
so dosis now if someone's taking that,172.409,5.491,177.89999999999998,fear
form in there probably a diabetic right,175.769,4.431,180.20000000000002,fear
as a diabetic they probably have some,177.9,5.009,182.909,fear
kidney liver and heart problems don't,180.2,5.05,185.25,NA

healthy to take neck Foreman nowadays to,185.25,6.03,191.28,NA
prevent this risk again it's very very,188.519,6.271,194.79,NA
simple take vitamin b1 and you can,191.28,6.209,197.489,NA
actually greatly reduce the risk of,194.79,6.46,201.25,NA
lactic acidosis thanks for watching,197.489,6.311,203.8,fear
so if you're enjoying this content go,201.25,3.99,205.24,fear
ahead and share it with someone that,203.8,4.55,208.35000000000002,fear
