tons of diets out there recommend eating low glycemic index foods but what exactly is the glycemic index let's science it hey welcome to nourishment i'm dr lara,0.16,22.559,22.719,angry
the glycemic index or gi is a method used to rank foods based on how they impact your blood glucose does eating this apple make your blood sugar spike super high and super fast or is the rise,13.28,22.72,36.0,angry
more gradual it was originally created to help people with diabetes select foods to improve their glycemic control by ranking foods as low medium or high gi,24.72,21.921,46.641,angry
you can't just guess the gi of a food by looking at the food label it has to be tested in order to express the impact of a particular food we need a reference to compare it to and we want this reference,35.92,22.32,58.24,angry
to be something that has maximum spike potential enter the sugar drink 50 grams of pure sucrose dissolved in water requires little digestion so the glucose can be rapidly absorbed into the,46.96,23.439,70.399,angry
bloodstream so i've fasted for over 12 hours and i haven't had any physical activity this morning and so now i can drink my pure sugar drink and i'm using a continuous glucose monitor to measure,58.719,23.121000000000002,81.84,angry
my blood glucose every five minutes cheers oh my goodness that's so sweet okay and now i'm going to sit tight for two hours so we can see the impact on my,70.08,24.558999999999997,94.639,angry
blood glucose so we see a pretty rapid spike in blood glucose it looks like it peaks 45 minutes after the drink and then normalizes back to baseline around 75 minutes so it's the next day and now,84.32,22.96,107.28,angry
we can do an experiment to find out the glycemic index of a particular test food so i'm going to test this dave's killer bread the 21 whole grains and seed version not an ad just a fan so,96.32,24.479,120.79899999999999,sad
we want to compare like to like and yesterday i drank a sugar beverage with 50 grams of sugar so it's 50 grams of digestible carbohydrate so today i'm going to eat a serving of bread that,108.399,22.321,130.72,NA
also gives me 50 grams of digestible carbohydrate now that word digestible is actually important because products like whole wheat breads and other fruits and vegetables they also contain fiber which,119.28,22.240000000000002,141.52,angry
is a carbohydrate but we can't actually digest it so when we're looking at the serving size that we want to eat to make sure we get 50 grams of digestible carbohydrate we have to actually,130.72,19.36,150.07999999999998,angry
subtract the fiber from the total carbohydrates in the product so when i look at the nutrition facts panel what i see is one slice of bread has 22 grams of carbohydrates in it but five of those,140.08,24.96,165.04000000000002,NA
grams are fiber so i take 22 minus five to get 17 grams of digestible carbohydrate per slice and so if i want to get 50 grams total then i need to eat almost three full slices of bread still,152.4,28.36,180.76,NA
not my typical breakfast but here we go those killer seeds in this graph we see my blood glucose to the sugar drink in red and to the bread in blue it's pretty striking how different they,165.2,23.320999999999998,188.521,NA
are over the two hours the bread caused a much more gradual rise in blood glucose and the peak was substantially lower compared to the sugar drink now to actually calculate the glycemic index we,181.92,23.759999999999998,205.67999999999998,angry
need to calculate the area under the curve for both the sugar drink and the bread separately then we divide the bread test area by the sugar drink reference and multiply,193.84,21.438000000000002,215.27800000000002,angry
by 100 to express it as a percent using this method the glycemic index for dave's killer seed bread is which puts it in the low gi category from this n of one experiment we,204.159,24.322000000000003,228.481,angry
observed that dave's killer seed bread raises my blood glucose only 34 percent as much as sugar drink over a two-hour period i was actually pretty surprised at how,216.72,19.839,236.559,sad
low the gi for this bread was i definitely expected it to be lower than the sugar drink due to the fiber content since fiber slows down the absorption of glucose but i really didn't think that,226.48,23.52,250.0,sad
it would be categorized as a low gi food because it's still bread and the reality is it might not be we can't exactly conclude that the gi of dave's killer seed bread is for sure 34 just from this,238.0,24.080000000000002,262.08,fear
experiment determining the gi of a food needs to be done in a larger sample of study participants than just me and each participant needs to do the experiment,250.879,20.32,271.199,NA
in duplicate or triplicate meaning drinking the sugar drink on three separate days and eating the test food on three separate days usually that sugar drink is made of pure,260.239,21.04,281.279,NA
glucose rather than the sucrose table sugar that i used it also turns out that there's a few more complications about the glycemic index and its applicability i dig into all of this in my video,271.04,24.08,295.12,NA
