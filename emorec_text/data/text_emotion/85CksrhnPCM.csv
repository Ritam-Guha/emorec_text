tons of diets out there recommend eating,0.16,4.8,4.96,happy
low glycemic index foods but what,2.0,5.52,7.52,happy
exactly is the glycemic index let's,4.96,5.12,10.08,happy
science it,7.52,2.56,10.08,happy
hey welcome to nourishment i'm dr lara,11.28,4.559,15.838999999999999,neutral
the glycemic index or gi is a method,13.28,4.72,18.0,neutral
used to rank foods based on how they,15.839,4.481,20.32,neutral
impact your blood glucose does eating,18.0,4.0,22.0,neutral
this apple make your blood sugar spike,20.32,4.4,24.72,neutral
super high and super fast or is the rise,22.0,5.119,27.119,neutral
more gradual it was originally created,24.72,4.479,29.198999999999998,
to help people with diabetes select,27.119,4.56,31.679,
foods to improve their glycemic control,29.199,5.681,34.88,neutral
by ranking foods as low medium or high,31.679,4.241,35.92,neutral
gi,34.88,2.96,37.84,neutral
you can't just guess the gi of a food by,35.92,4.0,39.92,neutral
looking at the food label it has to be,37.84,4.719,42.559000000000005,neutral
tested in order to express the impact of,39.92,4.799,44.719,
a particular food we need a reference to,42.559,4.401,46.959999999999994,
compare it to and we want this reference,44.719,4.401,49.120000000000005,
to be something that has maximum spike,46.96,5.04,52.0,neutral
potential enter the sugar drink,49.12,5.2,54.32,neutral
50 grams of pure sucrose dissolved in,52.0,4.559,56.559,neutral
water requires little digestion so the,54.32,4.399,58.719,
glucose can be rapidly absorbed into the,56.559,4.241,60.8,
bloodstream so i've fasted for over 12,58.719,3.441,62.160000000000004,
hours and i haven't had any physical,60.8,3.759,64.559,
activity this morning and so now i can,62.16,5.12,67.28,neutral
drink my pure sugar drink and i'm using,64.559,5.521,70.08,neutral
a continuous glucose monitor to measure,67.28,5.28,72.56,
my blood glucose every five minutes,70.08,4.719,74.79899999999999,
cheers,72.56,5.919,78.479,
oh my goodness that's so sweet,74.799,3.68,78.47900000000001,
okay and now i'm going to sit tight for,79.119,5.201,84.32,
two hours so we can see the impact on my,81.84,5.04,86.88000000000001,
blood glucose so we see a pretty rapid,84.32,4.799,89.119,neutral
spike in blood glucose it looks like it,86.88,4.559,91.439,neutral
peaks 45 minutes after the drink and,89.119,4.721,93.84,neutral
then normalizes back to baseline around,91.439,4.881,96.32,neutral
75 minutes so it's the next day and now,93.84,4.0,97.84,neutral
we can do an experiment to find out the,96.32,4.159,100.479,
glycemic index of a particular test food,97.84,4.559,102.399,
so i'm going to test this,100.479,4.721,105.2,
dave's killer bread the 21 whole grains,102.399,6.0,108.399,neutral
and seed version not an ad just a fan so,105.2,5.04,110.24000000000001,neutral
we want to compare like to like and,108.399,4.161,112.56,neutral
yesterday i drank a sugar beverage with,110.24,4.72,114.96,
50 grams of sugar so it's 50 grams of,112.56,4.559,117.119,
digestible carbohydrate so today i'm,114.96,4.32,119.28,
going to eat a serving of bread that,117.119,4.561,121.68,
also gives me 50 grams of digestible,119.28,4.879,124.159,
carbohydrate now that word digestible is,121.68,5.2,126.88000000000001,
actually important because products like,124.159,4.16,128.31900000000002,
whole wheat breads and other fruits and,126.88,3.84,130.72,
vegetables they also contain fiber which,128.319,4.161,132.48,
is a carbohydrate but we can't actually,130.72,4.0,134.72,
digest it so when we're looking at the,132.48,4.0,136.48,neutral
serving size that we want to eat to make,134.72,3.44,138.16,neutral
sure we get 50 grams of digestible,136.48,3.6,140.07999999999998,
carbohydrate we have to actually,138.16,4.32,142.48,
subtract the fiber from the total,140.08,4.799,144.87900000000002,
carbohydrates in the product so when i,142.48,4.64,147.11999999999998,
look at the nutrition facts panel what i,144.879,5.201,150.07999999999998,
see is one slice of bread has 22 grams,147.12,5.28,152.4,
of carbohydrates in it but five of those,150.08,5.04,155.12,
grams are fiber so i take 22 minus five,152.4,4.88,157.28,
to get 17 grams of digestible,155.12,4.24,159.36,
carbohydrate per slice and so if i want,157.28,4.959,162.239,
to get 50 grams total then i need to eat,159.36,5.84,165.20000000000002,
almost three full slices of bread still,162.239,8.441,170.68,
not my typical breakfast but here we go,165.2,5.48,170.67999999999998,
those killer seeds in this graph we see,172.879,4.561,177.44,neutral
my blood glucose to the sugar drink in,175.2,4.88,180.07999999999998,neutral
red and to the bread in blue,177.44,4.48,181.92,happy
it's pretty striking how different they,180.08,3.92,184.0,neutral
are over the two hours the bread caused,181.92,4.319,186.23899999999998,neutral
a much more gradual rise in blood,184.0,4.879,188.879,neutral
glucose and the peak was substantially,186.239,5.521,191.76,neutral
lower compared to the sugar drink now to,188.879,4.961,193.84,
actually calculate the glycemic index we,191.76,4.08,195.84,
need to calculate the area under the,193.84,4.16,198.0,
curve for both the sugar drink and the,195.84,3.84,199.68,neutral
bread separately,198.0,3.92,201.92,neutral
then we divide the bread test area by,199.68,4.479,204.15900000000002,neutral
the sugar drink reference and multiply,201.92,5.039,206.95899999999997,neutral
by 100 to express it as a percent,204.159,5.041,209.2,neutral
using this method the glycemic index for,206.959,4.881,211.84,neutral
dave's killer seed bread is,209.2,5.679,214.879,
which puts it in the low gi category,211.84,4.88,216.72,
from this n of one experiment we,214.879,3.841,218.72,neutral
observed that dave's killer seed bread,216.72,4.72,221.44,neutral
raises my blood glucose only 34 percent,218.72,4.96,223.68,neutral
as much as sugar drink over a two-hour,221.44,3.28,224.72,neutral
period,223.68,2.8,226.48000000000002,neutral
i was actually pretty surprised at how,224.72,4.079,228.799,fear
low the gi for this bread was i,226.48,4.24,230.72,fear
definitely expected it to be lower than,228.799,4.481,233.28,fear
the sugar drink due to the fiber content,230.72,4.879,235.599,fear
since fiber slows down the absorption of,233.28,4.72,238.0,fear
glucose but i really didn't think that,235.599,5.2,240.79899999999998,fear
it would be categorized as a low gi food,238.0,5.2,243.2,fear
because it's still bread and the reality,240.799,4.961,245.76000000000002,NA
is it might not be we can't exactly,243.2,4.64,247.83999999999997,NA
conclude that the gi of dave's killer,245.76,5.119,250.879,NA
seed bread is for sure 34 just from this,247.84,4.16,252.0,NA
experiment,250.879,2.961,253.84,NA
determining the gi of a food needs to be,252.0,3.76,255.76,NA
done in a larger sample of study,253.84,4.399,258.239,NA
participants than just me and each,255.76,4.479,260.239,NA
participant needs to do the experiment,258.239,4.721,262.96,NA
in duplicate or triplicate meaning,260.239,4.481,264.71999999999997,NA
drinking the sugar drink on three,262.96,4.0,266.96,NA
separate days and eating the test food,264.72,4.16,268.88000000000005,NA
on three separate days,266.96,4.08,271.03999999999996,NA
usually that sugar drink is made of pure,268.88,4.319,273.199,NA
glucose rather than the sucrose table,271.04,4.64,275.68,NA
sugar that i used it also turns out that,273.199,4.56,277.759,NA
there's a few more complications about,275.68,5.04,280.72,NA
the glycemic index and its applicability,277.759,4.88,282.639,NA
