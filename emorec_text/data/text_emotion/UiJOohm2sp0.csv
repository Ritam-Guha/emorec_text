hey guys in this video we're going to,0.03,3.54,3.57,fear
talk about the side effects of metformin,1.17,4.95,6.12,NA
okay this is a diabetic medication,3.57,4.83,8.4,fear
that's used for insulin resistance so,6.12,4.53,10.65,fear
basically it just makes the receptor,8.4,5.01,13.41,fear
cells absorb insulin better and it,10.65,5.879,16.529,NA
blocks the liver from making sugar it,13.41,5.369,18.779,NA
was originally developed from the lilac,16.529,4.08,20.609,NA
flower which is another name for that is,18.779,4.5,23.279,NA
called go true there is a active,20.609,7.221,27.830000000000002,NA
ingredient called guanidine that helps,23.279,7.051,30.33,NA
insulin resistance but the problem is,27.83,5.47,33.3,NA
that it creates lactic acidosis which is,30.33,5.61,35.94,NA
a bigger side effect it's a toxic side,33.3,4.41,37.709999999999994,fear
effect which you would get fatigue,35.94,4.35,40.29,fear
weakness muscle pain difficulty,37.71,6.029,43.739000000000004,fear
breathing vomiting and you know a 50% of,40.29,5.609,45.899,fear
the time you die okay so that's a,43.739,4.291,48.03,NA
problem however when you're consuming,45.899,4.111,50.01,NA
metformin you're not consuming straight,48.03,4.32,52.35,NA
guanidine it's a slight different,50.01,3.99,54.0,NA
variation of it I don't know exactly the,52.35,4.2,56.550000000000004,NA
details but it's not the same thing okay,54.0,4.35,58.35,NA
so what are the side effects of,56.55,5.75,62.3,NA
metformin diarrhea headaches heartburn,58.35,9.72,68.07000000000001,NA
stomach cramps and lactic acidosis okay,62.3,8.859,71.15899999999999,NA
I mean metformin has a black box warning,68.07,6.75,74.82,NA
that's a very severe warning now this,71.159,5.611,76.77000000000001,NA
may be rare but if you get this,74.82,4.38,79.19999999999999,NA
condition it's not good,76.77,5.459,82.229,NA
so if someone is on this medication I,79.2,5.73,84.93,fear
always always recommend also taking,82.229,5.82,88.049,NA
vitamin b1 from nutritional yeast,84.93,7.32,92.25,NA
because severe lactic acidosis can be,88.049,8.661,96.71000000000001,NA
reversed by taking b1 within 24 hours,92.25,7.92,100.17,NA
b1 protects against lactic acidosis now,96.71,6.189,102.899,NA
here's the problem and that Foreman,100.17,5.97,106.14,NA
blocks your absorption of b1 and if,102.899,4.771,107.67,NA
you're a diabetic already taking,106.14,3.33,109.47,NA
metformin you're already going to be,107.67,4.44,112.11,NA
deficient to b1 in the first place so,109.47,5.28,114.75,NA
you that's why you need to take b1 to,112.11,4.619,116.729,NA
minimize the side effects specifically,114.75,4.799,119.549,NA
this one and do healthy ketosis in a,116.729,4.89,121.619,NA
minute fasting to ultimately correct the,119.549,4.381,123.93,NA
deeper cause of the reason why you're on,121.619,3.901,125.52,NA
this in the first place but as your,123.93,3.45,127.38000000000001,NA
transition of healing your body and,125.52,4.709,130.22899999999998,NA
coming off this definitely take vitamin,127.38,4.89,132.26999999999998,NA
b1 in the form of nutritional yeast,130.229,4.951,135.18,NA
alright thanks for watching if you're,132.27,4.32,136.59,NA
