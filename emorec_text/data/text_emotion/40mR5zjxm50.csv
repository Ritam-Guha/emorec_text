We can explore what happens in Type 1 because,14.68,1.86,16.54,fear
it really does depend on what kind,17.32,1.78,19.1,fear
of person you are,19.16,1.28,20.44,
and how your Type 1 diabetes evolved and developed.,20.44,3.36,23.8,
If you have an interest in diabetes,24.8,1.88,26.68,
and you want to keep up to date,26.68,1.82,28.5,
"then subscribe, share, comment and like this page.",28.54,4.12,32.66,
So I'm just going to plot,33.28,1.72,35.0,
a simple graph here,35.5,1.24,36.74,
where we are looking at,36.74,0.74,37.480000000000004,
insulin production on one side against time,37.96,2.84,40.8,
and if we imagine that a person,41.58,1.66,43.239999999999995,angry
who doesn't have Type 1 diabetes,43.24,1.52,44.760000000000005,sad
is producing,44.76,1.06,45.82,
100% of their insulin needs.,46.32,2.0,48.32,
And so in producing 100% of their insulin needs,49.16,2.38,51.54,sad
something comes along,51.54,1.74,53.28,sad
that produces pancreatic trauma.,53.88,3.0,56.88,
Now that could be immediate.,57.14,1.98,59.12,
And that would be something like,59.86,1.8,61.66,sad
if your pancreas is removed,61.66,1.36,63.019999999999996,sad
and that often occurs if people have,63.02,1.9,64.92,angry
chronic pancreatitis or trauma,64.92,2.62,67.54,fear
or pancreatic carcinoma.,67.86,1.8,69.66,
So the more typical person who has Type 1 diabetes,70.02,2.9,72.92,
has a very sort of rapid onset,73.0,2.22,75.22,sad
but takes weeks to months to develop.,75.22,3.7,78.92,angry
And in this situation,79.96,1.28,81.24,sad
the pancreatic trauma that occurs,81.24,1.34,82.58,sad
is related to antibodies production.,83.28,2.24,85.52,sad
"Often it follows a viral infection,",85.94,2.62,88.56,
the body produces antibodies against that virus,88.98,2.76,91.74000000000001,
but unfortunately the antibodies,92.1,1.78,93.88,
also seem to,94.4,1.36,95.76,
look for the specific cells,95.92,3.42,99.34,
in the pancreas that produce insulin,99.44,1.84,101.28,sad
called beta cells,101.28,0.9,102.18,
and it destroys them over time.,102.48,1.9,104.38000000000001,
And people in that situation would,104.78,1.7,106.48,
develop symptoms over weeks to months,106.48,2.54,109.02000000000001,
where the pancreatic trauma event occurs,109.62,3.24,112.86,sad
and very quickly insulin production,112.92,1.74,114.66,
falls very dramatically.,114.66,1.46,116.11999999999999,sad
So symptoms start quite quickly,116.68,2.96,119.64,
and it becomes quite obvious.,119.98,2.42,122.4,
But there is another group of people,123.24,1.64,124.88,sad
with Type 1 diabetes,124.88,0.92,125.8,angry
who have a very slow progression of diabetes.,125.8,4.4,130.2,
And they are often misrepresented,130.52,2.56,133.08,
and thought of as having Type 2 diabetes,133.08,2.06,135.14000000000001,
because it evolves so slowly,135.82,2.9,138.72,
that their diabetes control,138.72,1.54,140.26,sad
can actually deteriorate over years,140.26,2.34,142.6,
rather than weeks.,142.98,1.6,144.57999999999998,
And so our classic description,144.82,1.98,146.79999999999998,
of someone developing Type 1 diabetes,146.8,1.46,148.26000000000002,sad
over weeks,148.26,0.78,149.04,sad
doesn't quite fit that mould,149.04,1.64,150.67999999999998,sad
and this group of people,150.68,0.88,151.56,sad
are often missed,152.04,1.22,153.26,angry
and are often treated with insulin very late.,153.26,2.72,155.98,sad
And then the final group of people,157.1,1.52,158.62,sad
that we see,158.62,0.82,159.44,sad
who have a pancreatic trauma event,159.7,2.92,162.61999999999998,
are people who have,163.46,1.36,164.82000000000002,
for whatever reason,164.94,1.14,166.07999999999998,
a small self-limiting event,166.46,3.06,169.52,
which takes out a percentage of their,169.78,1.9,171.68,
pancreatic production.,171.68,1.5,173.18,
So it may be that a virus comes along,173.72,2.98,176.7,sad
"the pancreas is affected,",176.86,1.26,178.12,sad
it takes about 20% of beta cell function,178.12,2.68,180.8,sad
and then they recover.,181.16,1.34,182.5,sad
And it may be that they end up,183.24,1.68,184.92000000000002,
still producing a decent amount of insulin,184.92,2.06,186.98,
and can have a great result,187.22,2.68,189.9,
"with a small amount of insulin to top them up,",190.0,2.0,192.0,
it may be that they have 50% production of insulin,192.26,3.44,195.7,
or it might be that they even have 20% or 30%.,196.18,3.6,199.78,
But this group of people continue,200.18,1.66,201.84,
to produce insulin,201.84,1.32,203.16,
forever,204.66,0.66,205.32,NA
and their short term self-limiting illness,205.78,2.82,208.6,NA
kind of resolves,208.84,1.16,210.0,NA
but leaves them with an ongoing,210.0,2.0,212.0,NA
permanent reduction in insulin production,212.0,2.3,214.3,NA
that requires them to manage,214.7,1.56,216.26,NA
their insulin deficiency,216.26,1.94,218.2,NA
with insulin in the long term.,218.24,2.14,220.38,NA
