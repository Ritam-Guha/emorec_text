Thank You Teresa,4.43,5.74,10.17,happy
and thanks to everyone of you and for,6.45,5.58,12.030000000000001,happy
the organizer to organize this is a,10.17,4.589,14.759,happy
fantastic thing I actually found out,12.03,4.979,17.009,happy
this morning that today in Europe,14.759,4.801,19.560000000000002,happy
they're having a stem-cell day,17.009,4.77,21.779,happy
it's called uni stem it's sponsored by,19.56,3.929,23.488999999999997,happy
unis stem so I think it's quite a,21.779,3.12,24.899,happy
coincidence and I think it's nice that,23.489,3.33,26.819000000000003,happy
we're engaging with the public and,24.899,3.63,28.529,happy
university throughout the world,26.819,3.75,30.569,happy
discussed this of course I'm a stem cell,28.529,4.44,32.969,happy
biologist so I'm gonna argue for the,30.569,7.071,37.64,happy
stem cell use of cells or pancreatic,32.969,7.32,40.289,happy
cells derived from the embryonic stem,37.64,4.149,41.789,neutral
cells are pluripotent stem cells to,40.289,4.531,44.82,sad
treat type 1 diabetes and as you heard,41.789,6.98,48.769000000000005,sad
from Derek before in the introduction,44.82,7.289,52.109,sad
the current treatment for type 1,48.769,7.47,56.239,sad
diabetes is insulin injection either by,52.109,7.68,59.789,sad
needles or with pumps which you will,56.239,6.611,62.849999999999994,sad
hear in the second debate but this,59.789,7.561,67.35,sad
treatment is not very efficient because,62.85,8.46,71.31,happy
we cannot control in real time the sugar,67.35,6.299,73.649,happy
concentration in your blood in the blood,71.31,4.949,76.259,happy
and this is the job of the beta cells,73.649,5.211,78.86,happy
the beta cells in your pancreas is,76.259,5.911,82.17,happy
constantly monitoring the sugar level in,78.86,6.219,85.079,happy
your blood and constantly adjusting so,82.17,5.01,87.18,happy
if there is too much sugar the beta,85.079,4.5,89.579,happy
cells releases insulin insulin is like a,87.18,4.68,91.86000000000001,happy
message goes to the other organs and say,89.579,3.54,93.119,happy
there is too much sugar in your blood,91.86,5.939,97.799,happy
take it up so if we can substitute these,93.119,7.371,100.49,happy
beta cells there is destroyed in type 1,97.799,6.03,103.82900000000001,sad
diabetics patients then we can cure the,100.49,5.559,106.04899999999999,sad
disease and we know we can do this,103.829,4.89,108.719,sad
because transplantation of the entire,106.049,5.371,111.42,sad
pancreas or the islets as you heard,108.719,4.89,113.609,sad
before which are isolated from the,111.42,5.64,117.06,sad
pancreas works but it doesn't work for a,113.609,5.82,119.429,sad
long time as we heard after five years,117.06,4.979,122.039,sad
usually a patient needs to have another,119.429,5.071,124.5,sad
transplant of islets unless they receive,122.039,5.551,127.59,happy
the whole pancreas which is usually more,124.5,5.22,129.72,happy
successful but the problem with that,127.59,3.88,131.47,happy
there are two problems with that,129.72,3.91,133.63,sad
the first problem is immunosuppressants,131.47,4.08,135.55,sad
immunosuppressants are very harsh drugs,133.63,4.08,137.71,happy
but you know you don't want to give with,135.55,4.17,139.72,happy
to pay to patients with type 1 diabetes,137.71,4.29,142.0,happy
it's actually better to be on insulin,139.72,3.93,143.65,sad
treatment rather than having,142.0,4.17,146.17,happy
immunosuppressants so only patients are,143.65,5.91,149.56,happy
really sick and cannot control their,146.17,5.79,151.95999999999998,happy
blood glucose with insulin injection,149.56,4.74,154.3,happy
will be candidate for all pancreas,151.96,4.29,156.25,happy
transplantation or islet transplantation,154.3,5.1,159.4,happy
the second biggest problem that we have,156.25,5.82,162.07,happy
with the transplantation is that we,159.4,5.43,164.83,happy
don't have enough donors even if you,162.07,5.34,167.41,happy
want to you know if you want a cure even,164.83,5.1,169.93,happy
if everybody in the world decides to,167.41,5.79,173.2,happy
become a donor after their death we will,169.93,6.06,175.99,happy
not have enough patients we would not,173.2,5.49,178.69,happy
have enough donors to cure every patient,175.99,6.09,182.08,happy
with type 1 diabetes so how are we gonna,178.69,6.11,184.8,sad
address this we're gonna generate cells,182.08,5.91,187.99,sad
from pure potent stem cells and that,184.8,5.29,190.09,happy
will allow us to generate an unlimited,187.99,5.13,193.12,happy
source of beta cells that can cure type,190.09,5.52,195.61,happy
1 diabetes and we know we can do this,193.12,5.64,198.76,happy
and when I say this is because this is,195.61,5.19,200.8,happy
not the future this is happening now,198.76,4.62,203.38,happy
it's not science fiction we can actually,200.8,3.51,204.31,happy
do this,203.38,3.78,207.16,sad
every day I do it in the lab not this,204.31,5.13,209.44,sad
tower here but on the other side of Mars,207.16,4.59,211.75,sad
and if you know if you haven't become,209.44,4.019,213.459,happy
interested in science and you want to,211.75,3.84,215.59,happy
come and become a summer student in my,213.459,4.291,217.75,happy
lab and maybe graduate students I'm here,215.59,5.34,220.93,happy
promoting my love you can come and I'll,217.75,5.489,223.239,happy
teach you how to do this we we take an,220.93,4.5,225.43,sad
embryonic stem cells or an IPS cells,223.239,5.551,228.79,happy
which is as dr. Ali apigenin showed you,225.43,6.21,231.64000000000001,happy
before itself from you any one of you,228.79,4.949,233.739,sad
here that I can revert to become,231.64,4.59,236.23,sad
embryonic stem cell like and we can,233.739,5.131,238.87,sad
convert it into a pancreatic cells and,236.23,6.18,242.41,happy
as of last year two groups one in Canada,238.87,5.7,244.57,happy
and one in the u.s. showed that we can,242.41,4.53,246.94,happy
actually make beta cells in vitro and,244.57,5.01,249.57999999999998,happy
we've been able to reproduce that so,246.94,5.609,252.549,happy
what we're doing now is taking these,249.58,7.469,257.04900000000004,happy
cells either a cell that can become a,252.549,6.66,259.209,sad
pancreatic reject can become a beta,257.049,4.471,261.52,sad
cells or in the future a beta cell,259.209,2.981,262.19,sad
itself,261.52,3.1,264.62,happy
and we can transplant it into patients,262.19,4.11,266.3,happy
with type 1 diabetes to cure the disease,264.62,5.58,270.2,happy
and again this is not the future this is,266.3,6.27,272.57,happy
already happening there is a clinical,270.2,6.74,276.94,happy
trial undergoing right now in the States,272.57,7.11,279.68,happy
treating patient with this type of cells,276.94,4.96,281.9,happy
treating patient with type 1 diabetes,279.68,5.28,284.96,sad
with this type of cells and very soon I,281.9,5.85,287.75,happy
expect that Canada will launch the same,284.96,5.91,290.87,happy
clinical trial the FDA approved the,287.75,6.75,294.5,happy
trial in the u.s. and Health Canada has,290.87,7.14,298.01,happy
approved the trial in in in Canada it,294.5,5.37,299.87,happy
hasn't started yet but I think he's,298.01,4.68,302.69,happy
gonna start very soon so you can see how,299.87,5.46,305.33,happy
this is not a question of how and,302.69,4.95,307.64,NA
whether we're gonna do this we're gonna,305.33,5.1,310.43,NA
do it and we're just gonna get better at,307.64,5.91,313.55,NA
this and the best you know the the best,310.43,5.58,316.01,NA
side of this is that we we're gonna put,313.55,5.28,318.83,NA
these cells inside the device imagine,316.01,5.52,321.53,NA
this device to be like a tea bag where,318.83,4.23,323.06,NA
you're gonna have the cells inside the,321.53,4.14,325.66999999999996,NA
tea bag they're protected from the,323.06,4.89,327.95,NA
immune system that would normally attack,325.67,4.59,330.26,NA
the cells but they can sense the sugar,327.95,5.16,333.11,NA
coming through the pores of the membrane,330.26,5.55,335.81,NA
and can release insulin into the,333.11,5.16,338.27000000000004,NA
bloodstream so even even if something,335.81,5.91,341.72,NA
goes wrong in the preparation that we,338.27,5.97,344.24,NA
put into a patient we can figure it out,341.72,5.07,346.79,NA
and remove the tea bag from the patient,344.24,4.98,349.22,NA
so you know when I heard from Theresa,346.79,4.92,351.71000000000004,NA
that my opponent was Derrick Vander coy,349.22,5.99,355.21000000000004,NA
I was a bit scared because he's the,351.71,6.45,358.15999999999997,NA
hardest person to debate against but as,355.21,5.32,360.53,NA
you can see this argument is pretty,358.16,4.77,362.93,NA
strong so I'm actually looking forward,360.53,5.7,366.22999999999996,NA
to hear what he can come up with and you,362.93,7.14,370.07,NA
know please stay on my side thank you,366.23,5.52,371.75,NA
very much and take questions after,370.07,4.43,374.5,NA
Derrick start,371.75,2.75,374.5,NA
