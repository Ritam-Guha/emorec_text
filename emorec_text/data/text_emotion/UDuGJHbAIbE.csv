Thank You Teresa and thanks to everyone of you and for the organizer to organize this is a fantastic thing I actually found out this morning that today in Europe,4.43,25.689,30.119,neutral
they're having a stem-cell day it's called uni stem it's sponsored by unis stem so I think it's quite a coincidence and I think it's nice that we're engaging with the public and,17.009,18.779,35.788,neutral
university throughout the world discussed this of course I'm a stem cell biologist so I'm gonna argue for the stem cell use of cells or pancreatic cells derived from the embryonic stem,26.819,26.730000000000004,53.54900000000001,neutral
cells are pluripotent stem cells to treat type 1 diabetes and as you heard from Derek before in the introduction the current treatment for type 1 diabetes is insulin injection either by,40.289,33.949999999999996,74.239,neutral
needles or with pumps which you will hear in the second debate but this treatment is not very efficient because we cannot control in real time the sugar concentration in your blood in the blood,56.239,33.88,90.119,neutral
and this is the job of the beta cells the beta cells in your pancreas is constantly monitoring the sugar level in your blood and constantly adjusting so if there is too much sugar the beta,73.649,26.851,100.5,neutral
cells releases insulin insulin is like a message goes to the other organs and say there is too much sugar in your blood take it up so if we can substitute these beta cells there is destroyed in type 1,87.18,27.560000000000002,114.74000000000001,neutral
diabetics patients then we can cure the disease and we know we can do this because transplantation of the entire pancreas or the islets as you heard before which are isolated from the,100.49,26.35,126.84,neutral
pancreas works but it doesn't work for a long time as we heard after five years usually a patient needs to have another transplant of islets unless they receive the whole pancreas which is usually more,113.609,26.641,140.25,neutral
successful but the problem with that there are two problems with that the first problem is immunosuppressants immunosuppressants are very harsh drugs but you know you don't want to give with,127.59,20.12,147.71,neutral
to pay to patients with type 1 diabetes it's actually better to be on insulin treatment rather than having immunosuppressants so only patients are really sick and cannot control their,137.71,24.09,161.8,neutral
blood glucose with insulin injection will be candidate for all pancreas transplantation or islet transplantation the second biggest problem that we have with the transplantation is that we,149.56,25.380000000000003,174.94,neutral
don't have enough donors even if you want to you know if you want a cure even if everybody in the world decides to become a donor after their death we will not have enough patients we would not,162.07,27.78,189.85,neutral
have enough donors to cure every patient with type 1 diabetes so how are we gonna address this we're gonna generate cells from pure potent stem cells and that will allow us to generate an unlimited,175.99,28.529999999999998,204.52,neutral
source of beta cells that can cure type 1 diabetes and we know we can do this and when I say this is because this is not the future this is happening now it's not science fiction we can actually,190.09,24.480000000000004,214.57,neutral
do this every day I do it in the lab not this tower here but on the other side of Mars and if you know if you haven't become interested in science and you want to,203.38,21.358999999999998,224.739,neutral
come and become a summer student in my lab and maybe graduate students I'm here promoting my love you can come and I'll teach you how to do this we we take an embryonic stem cells or an IPS cells,213.459,25.171,238.63,neutral
which is as dr. Ali apigenin showed you before itself from you any one of you here that I can revert to become embryonic stem cell like and we can convert it into a pancreatic cells and,225.43,27.06,252.49,neutral
as of last year two groups one in Canada and one in the u.s. showed that we can actually make beta cells in vitro and we've been able to reproduce that so what we're doing now is taking these,238.87,28.318,267.188,neutral
cells either a cell that can become a pancreatic reject can become a beta cells or in the future a beta cell itself and we can transplant it into patients,252.549,21.322,273.871,neutral
with type 1 diabetes to cure the disease and again this is not the future this is already happening there is a clinical trial undergoing right now in the States treating patient with this type of cells,264.62,30.66,295.28000000000003,neutral
treating patient with type 1 diabetes with this type of cells and very soon I expect that Canada will launch the same clinical trial the FDA approved the trial in the u.s. and Health Canada has,279.68,30.93,310.61,neutral
approved the trial in in in Canada it hasn't started yet but I think he's gonna start very soon so you can see how this is not a question of how and whether we're gonna do this we're gonna,294.5,25.560000000000002,320.06,NA
do it and we're just gonna get better at this and the best you know the the best side of this is that we we're gonna put these cells inside the device imagine this device to be like a tea bag where,307.64,26.52,334.15999999999997,NA
you're gonna have the cells inside the tea bag they're protected from the immune system that would normally attack the cells but they can sense the sugar coming through the pores of the membrane,321.53,24.330000000000002,345.85999999999996,NA
and can release insulin into the bloodstream so even even if something goes wrong in the preparation that we put into a patient we can figure it out and remove the tea bag from the patient,333.11,27.09,360.2,NA
so you know when I heard from Theresa that my opponent was Derrick Vander coy I was a bit scared because he's the hardest person to debate against but as you can see this argument is pretty,346.79,27.45,374.24,NA
strong so I'm actually looking forward to hear what he can come up with and you know please stay on my side thank you very much and take questions after Derrick start,360.53,25.54,386.07,NA
