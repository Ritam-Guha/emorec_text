familiar with with your diabetic,2.7,7.35,10.05,neutral
diagnosis is the phrase hba1c it's not,4.94,7.199,12.139,neutral
very user friendly it is a medical term,10.05,7.02,17.07,sad
it's to do with your hemoglobin in your,12.139,8.021,20.16,neutral
blood hemoglobin actually gives the red,17.07,5.31,22.38,neutral
color to red blood cells making your,20.16,4.5,24.66,neutral
blood red and one of the things that,22.38,5.01,27.39,neutral
happens in the body's metabolism is that,24.66,5.689,30.349,sad
glucose actually sticks to hemoglobin,27.39,6.3,33.69,neutral
hemoglobin molecules usually live for,30.349,6.341,36.69,neutral
eight to 12 weeks so within that life,33.69,5.43,39.12,neutral
cycle they just give an average of the,36.69,6.17,42.86,neutral
whole two to three months of your,39.12,7.74,46.86,neutral
control you should be getting an HP a1c,42.86,7.12,49.98,neutral
reading every time you go to clinic and,46.86,4.44,51.3,neutral
type one diabetics really ought to be,49.98,3.03,53.01,neutral
going to clinic every three to four,51.3,3.89,55.19,sad
months if possible,53.01,7.02,60.03,neutral
not all GPS do hba1c tests you might,55.19,6.43,61.62,neutral
actually actually end up being sent,60.03,4.349,64.379,neutral
either to a phlebotomist at your GPS or,61.62,4.89,66.50999999999999,neutral
going to the local hospital to get blood,64.379,5.31,69.68900000000001,neutral
drawn to get this done it's not usually,66.51,5.429,71.93900000000001,neutral
something that can get measured on a,69.689,4.381,74.07,neutral
certainly not on everyday meter where,71.939,4.051,75.99,neutral
there are some meters coming out that,74.07,4.68,78.75,neutral
are being designed for GPS surgery so,75.99,4.89,80.88,neutral
that they can do an hba1c on the spot,78.75,6.18,84.93,neutral
like any number it it needs to be taken,80.88,7.169,88.04899999999999,neutral
in context it's presented as a,84.93,6.149,91.07900000000001,neutral
percentage I mean for example my hba1c,88.049,5.851,93.9,neutral
is normally eight point two eight point,91.079,5.43,96.50899999999999,neutral
three percent it's not bad but it's not,93.9,7.579,101.479,neutral
great ideally it should be under six,96.509,7.831,104.34,neutral
normal diet well normal people who are,101.479,6.541,108.02,neutral
not diabetic it's usually under five now,104.34,6.63,110.97,neutral
because the diabetic is dealing with the,108.02,4.75,112.77,neutral
fact that their blood Sugar's can rise,110.97,4.56,115.53,neutral
quite a lot you know we can't literally,112.77,5.639,118.40899999999999,neutral
be expected to have the same reading as,115.53,5.97,121.5,neutral
a non diabetic in fact there's some,118.409,5.941,124.35000000000001,sad
evidence to point that trying to achieve,121.5,6.599,128.099,sad
that level actually reduces your chances,124.35,5.639,129.989,sad
of living a really long time if you do,128.099,3.901,132.0,fear
try and achieve that with diabetes it,129.989,2.991,132.98000000000002,fear
means such too,132.0,6.26,138.26,neutral
control having said that the hba1c is,132.98,8.97,141.95,neutral
the best guide we have so what are the,138.26,5.16,143.42,neutral
things that's happening today is the HP,141.95,3.45,145.39999999999998,sad
a1c test is actually being used to,143.42,5.399,148.819,neutral
diagnose diabetes it has been for a long,145.4,6.449,151.84900000000002,neutral
time but the fact is if people just do a,148.819,5.371,154.19,neutral
one-off blood test if your doctor does a,151.849,4.92,156.76899999999998,neutral
one-off blood test on you you might,154.19,5.189,159.379,neutral
actually be at that stage having a,156.769,6.03,162.799,neutral
normal or low blood sugar so you won't,159.379,7.741,167.12,neutral
show as having an abnormal blood sugar,162.799,7.41,170.209,neutral
reading but if you have blood tests done,167.12,4.56,171.68,neutral
over the space of a couple of weeks you,170.209,3.0,173.209,neutral
might find that there are peaks and,171.68,4.139,175.81900000000002,neutral
troughs that are not normal normal non,173.209,4.411,177.62,sad
diabetics simply don't go out of this,175.819,4.321,180.14,sad
range if the range is like this people,177.62,5.759,183.37900000000002,sad
stay within it diabetics tend to do this,180.14,5.84,185.98,NA
thing if you go over and above the norm,183.379,7.621,191.0,neutral
so the hba1c test is a it's a stake in,185.98,6.94,192.92,neutral
the ground it's literally something you,191.0,3.0,194.0,neutral
can hang your hat on,192.92,4.319,197.23899999999998,neutral
it that you can't judge all your,194.0,5.31,199.31,neutral
diabetic control from it because of the,197.239,4.921,202.16,neutral
fact it's an average if your hba1c is,199.31,5.94,205.25,neutral
6.5 it might actually be hiding quite,202.16,5.04,207.2,neutral
badly but controlled diabetes we you,205.25,3.15,208.4,neutral
might be spending an awful lot of time,207.2,3.569,210.76899999999998,sad
having hypos which wouldn't be very,208.4,5.48,213.88,neutral
desirable in terms of quality of life,210.769,6.53,217.299,neutral
having said that it's very important,213.88,7.509,221.389,neutral
because it's the clearest indicator we,217.299,8.53,225.829,neutral
have as to your long-term ability to,221.389,6.331,227.72,neutral
live with diabetes and not end up with,225.829,3.75,229.579,neutral
what they call diabetic complications,227.72,4.71,232.43,neutral
which is damage to the body there was a,229.579,5.52,235.09900000000002,neutral
test called the DC CT it was done in,232.43,4.739,237.169,neutral
America it wasn't a test as a study and,235.099,5.631,240.73,neutral
it went on for ten years between 1983 to,237.169,6.781,243.95000000000002,neutral
1993 and they took more than a thousand,240.73,5.259,245.98899999999998,neutral
people with diabetes you had only had it,243.95,4.2,248.14999999999998,neutral
between one and fifteen years and who,245.989,4.47,250.459,neutral
had no signs of either nerve damage or,248.15,5.339,253.489,neutral
eye damage or kidney damage and they put,250.459,6.541,257.0,neutral
them into two groups one had normal,253.489,9.721,263.21,neutral
control as per the time frame that they,257.0,6.93,263.93,sad
were history,263.21,1.63,264.84,neutral
how it was,263.93,2.769,266.699,neutral
looked at being controlled back then,264.84,6.03,270.86999999999995,neutral
which is 25 years ago at versus what,266.699,6.091,272.79,neutral
they called tight control which is,270.87,4.65,275.52,neutral
really its carb counting multiple blood,272.79,5.64,278.43,neutral
testing multiple injections and they,275.52,6.72,282.24,neutral
were able to show that the multiple you,278.43,7.049,285.479,neutral
know that the tight control helps stave,282.24,5.82,288.06,sad
off any complications it helped to have,285.479,6.061,291.53999999999996,sad
much better hba1c results and good age,288.06,5.85,293.91,sad
be able to see results lead to a much,291.54,4.08,295.62,neutral
better long-term prognosis,293.91,6.33,300.24,neutral
so the hba1c is an important number and,295.62,6.42,302.04,neutral
you should be getting it looked at at,300.24,4.26,304.5,neutral
least every three to six months and if,302.04,3.99,306.03000000000003,fear
the numbers always good and there's no,304.5,4.26,308.76,neutral
need to worry but if it's always bad,306.03,5.34,311.36999999999995,neutral
then you know you need to keep keep,308.76,4.5,313.26,neutral
trying with new medications and new,311.37,3.87,315.24,neutral
tools until you can get the balance,313.26,4.62,317.88,neutral
right in your life so just two points,315.24,5.34,320.58,sad
about using the hba1c test to diagnose,317.88,6.3,324.18,sad
diabetes if it comes up at as higher,320.58,7.41,327.99,sad
than or greater than 6.5 percent you're,324.18,5.85,330.03000000000003,sad
pretty much defined as having diabetes,327.99,5.82,333.81,sad
if it comes up between six and six point,330.03,5.759,335.789,neutral
five you're probably going to get,333.81,4.38,338.19,neutral
diagnosed with pre-diabetes or what's,335.789,4.201,339.99,neutral
for a while was called at one point five,338.19,4.979,343.169,neutral
diabetes as opposed to type one or type,339.99,7.17,347.16,neutral
two but if your reading is less than six,343.169,6.151,349.32,neutral
percent then you're not considered to be,347.16,5.93,353.09000000000003,neutral
either pre-diabetic or diabetic,349.32,3.77,353.09,neutral
