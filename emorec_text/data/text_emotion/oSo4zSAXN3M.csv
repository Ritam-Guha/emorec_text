okay one of the things will become familiar with with your diabetic diagnosis is the phrase hba1c it's not very user friendly it is a medical term it's to do with your hemoglobin in your,0.06,34.47,34.53,angry
blood hemoglobin actually gives the red color to red blood cells making your blood red and one of the things that happens in the body's metabolism is that glucose actually sticks to hemoglobin,17.07,26.809,43.879000000000005,angry
hemoglobin molecules usually live for eight to 12 weeks so within that life cycle they just give an average of the whole two to three months of your control you should be getting an HP a1c,30.349,32.801,63.150000000000006,angry
reading every time you go to clinic and type one diabetics really ought to be going to clinic every three to four months if possible not all GPS do hba1c tests you might,46.86,24.810000000000002,71.67,angry
actually actually end up being sent either to a phlebotomist at your GPS or going to the local hospital to get blood drawn to get this done it's not usually something that can get measured on a,60.03,24.359,84.38900000000001,angry
certainly not on everyday meter where there are some meters coming out that are being designed for GPS surgery so that they can do an hba1c on the spot like any number it it needs to be taken,71.939,26.97,98.90899999999999,angry
in context it's presented as a percentage I mean for example my hba1c is normally eight point two eight point three percent it's not bad but it's not great ideally it should be under six,84.93,32.84,117.77000000000001,angry
normal diet well normal people who are not diabetic it's usually under five now because the diabetic is dealing with the fact that their blood Sugar's can rise quite a lot you know we can't literally,101.479,28.119999999999997,129.599,angry
be expected to have the same reading as a non diabetic in fact there's some evidence to point that trying to achieve that level actually reduces your chances of living a really long time if you do,115.53,28.049999999999997,143.57999999999998,angry
try and achieve that with diabetes it means such too control having said that the hba1c is the best guide we have so what are the things that's happening today is the HP,129.989,26.831,156.82,angry
a1c test is actually being used to diagnose diabetes it has been for a long time but the fact is if people just do a one-off blood test if your doctor does a one-off blood test on you you might,143.42,27.328000000000003,170.748,angry
actually be at that stage having a normal or low blood sugar so you won't show as having an abnormal blood sugar reading but if you have blood tests done over the space of a couple of weeks you,156.769,28.741,185.51,angry
might find that there are peaks and troughs that are not normal normal non diabetics simply don't go out of this range if the range is like this people stay within it diabetics tend to do this,171.68,24.470000000000002,196.15,angry
thing if you go over and above the norm so the hba1c test is a it's a stake in the ground it's literally something you can hang your hat on it that you can't judge all your,183.379,27.189999999999998,210.569,angry
diabetic control from it because of the fact it's an average if your hba1c is 6.5 it might actually be hiding quite badly but controlled diabetes we you might be spending an awful lot of time,197.239,22.619999999999997,219.859,angry
having hypos which wouldn't be very desirable in terms of quality of life having said that it's very important because it's the clearest indicator we have as to your long-term ability to,208.4,34.38,242.78,angry
live with diabetes and not end up with what they call diabetic complications which is damage to the body there was a test called the DC CT it was done in America it wasn't a test as a study and,225.829,24.35,250.179,angry
it went on for ten years between 1983 to 1993 and they took more than a thousand people with diabetes you had only had it between one and fifteen years and who had no signs of either nerve damage or,237.169,26.049,263.218,angry
eye damage or kidney damage and they put them into two groups one had normal control as per the time frame that they were history how it was,250.459,27.591,278.05,angry
looked at being controlled back then which is 25 years ago at versus what they called tight control which is really its carb counting multiple blood testing multiple injections and they,264.84,29.131,293.971,angry
were able to show that the multiple you know that the tight control helps stave off any complications it helped to have much better hba1c results and good age be able to see results lead to a much,278.43,28.86,307.29,angry
better long-term prognosis so the hba1c is an important number and you should be getting it looked at at least every three to six months and if the numbers always good and there's no,293.91,25.259999999999998,319.17,angry
need to worry but if it's always bad then you know you need to keep keep trying with new medications and new tools until you can get the balance right in your life so just two points,306.03,23.67,329.7,angry
about using the hba1c test to diagnose diabetes if it comes up at as higher than or greater than 6.5 percent you're pretty much defined as having diabetes if it comes up between six and six point,317.88,31.139000000000003,349.019,angry
five you're probably going to get diagnosed with pre-diabetes or what's for a while was called at one point five diabetes as opposed to type one or type two but if your reading is less than six,333.81,26.880999999999997,360.691,angry
percent then you're not considered to be either pre-diabetic or diabetic,347.16,9.7,356.86,angry
