okay one of the things will become,0.06,4.88,4.9399999999999995,angry
familiar with with your diabetic,2.7,7.35,10.05,angry
diagnosis is the phrase hba1c it's not,4.94,7.199,12.139,angry
very user friendly it is a medical term,10.05,7.02,17.07,angry
it's to do with your hemoglobin in your,12.139,8.021,20.16,angry
blood hemoglobin actually gives the red,17.07,5.31,22.38,angry
color to red blood cells making your,20.16,4.5,24.66,angry
blood red and one of the things that,22.38,5.01,27.39,angry
happens in the body's metabolism is that,24.66,5.689,30.349,angry
glucose actually sticks to hemoglobin,27.39,6.3,33.69,angry
hemoglobin molecules usually live for,30.349,6.341,36.69,angry
eight to 12 weeks so within that life,33.69,5.43,39.12,angry
cycle they just give an average of the,36.69,6.17,42.86,angry
whole two to three months of your,39.12,7.74,46.86,angry
control you should be getting an HP a1c,42.86,7.12,49.98,angry
reading every time you go to clinic and,46.86,4.44,51.3,angry
type one diabetics really ought to be,49.98,3.03,53.01,angry
going to clinic every three to four,51.3,3.89,55.19,angry
months if possible,53.01,7.02,60.03,angry
not all GPS do hba1c tests you might,55.19,6.43,61.62,angry
actually actually end up being sent,60.03,4.349,64.379,fear
either to a phlebotomist at your GPS or,61.62,4.89,66.50999999999999,angry
going to the local hospital to get blood,64.379,5.31,69.68900000000001,angry
drawn to get this done it's not usually,66.51,5.429,71.93900000000001,fear
something that can get measured on a,69.689,4.381,74.07,angry
certainly not on everyday meter where,71.939,4.051,75.99,angry
there are some meters coming out that,74.07,4.68,78.75,angry
are being designed for GPS surgery so,75.99,4.89,80.88,angry
that they can do an hba1c on the spot,78.75,6.18,84.93,angry
like any number it it needs to be taken,80.88,7.169,88.04899999999999,angry
in context it's presented as a,84.93,6.149,91.07900000000001,fear
percentage I mean for example my hba1c,88.049,5.851,93.9,angry
is normally eight point two eight point,91.079,5.43,96.50899999999999,angry
three percent it's not bad but it's not,93.9,7.579,101.479,angry
great ideally it should be under six,96.509,7.831,104.34,angry
normal diet well normal people who are,101.479,6.541,108.02,angry
not diabetic it's usually under five now,104.34,6.63,110.97,angry
because the diabetic is dealing with the,108.02,4.75,112.77,angry
fact that their blood Sugar's can rise,110.97,4.56,115.53,angry
quite a lot you know we can't literally,112.77,5.639,118.40899999999999,fear
be expected to have the same reading as,115.53,5.97,121.5,angry
a non diabetic in fact there's some,118.409,5.941,124.35000000000001,angry
evidence to point that trying to achieve,121.5,6.599,128.099,angry
that level actually reduces your chances,124.35,5.639,129.989,angry
of living a really long time if you do,128.099,3.901,132.0,angry
try and achieve that with diabetes it,129.989,2.991,132.98000000000002,angry
means such too,132.0,6.26,138.26,angry
control having said that the hba1c is,132.98,8.97,141.95,angry
the best guide we have so what are the,138.26,5.16,143.42,angry
things that's happening today is the HP,141.95,3.45,145.39999999999998,angry
a1c test is actually being used to,143.42,5.399,148.819,angry
diagnose diabetes it has been for a long,145.4,6.449,151.84900000000002,angry
time but the fact is if people just do a,148.819,5.371,154.19,angry
one-off blood test if your doctor does a,151.849,4.92,156.76899999999998,angry
one-off blood test on you you might,154.19,5.189,159.379,angry
actually be at that stage having a,156.769,6.03,162.799,angry
normal or low blood sugar so you won't,159.379,7.741,167.12,angry
show as having an abnormal blood sugar,162.799,7.41,170.209,angry
reading but if you have blood tests done,167.12,4.56,171.68,angry
over the space of a couple of weeks you,170.209,3.0,173.209,angry
might find that there are peaks and,171.68,4.139,175.81900000000002,angry
troughs that are not normal normal non,173.209,4.411,177.62,angry
diabetics simply don't go out of this,175.819,4.321,180.14,angry
range if the range is like this people,177.62,5.759,183.37900000000002,angry
stay within it diabetics tend to do this,180.14,5.84,185.98,angry
thing if you go over and above the norm,183.379,7.621,191.0,angry
so the hba1c test is a it's a stake in,185.98,6.94,192.92,angry
the ground it's literally something you,191.0,3.0,194.0,angry
can hang your hat on,192.92,4.319,197.23899999999998,angry
it that you can't judge all your,194.0,5.31,199.31,angry
diabetic control from it because of the,197.239,4.921,202.16,angry
fact it's an average if your hba1c is,199.31,5.94,205.25,angry
6.5 it might actually be hiding quite,202.16,5.04,207.2,angry
badly but controlled diabetes we you,205.25,3.15,208.4,angry
might be spending an awful lot of time,207.2,3.569,210.76899999999998,angry
having hypos which wouldn't be very,208.4,5.48,213.88,angry
desirable in terms of quality of life,210.769,6.53,217.299,angry
having said that it's very important,213.88,7.509,221.389,angry
because it's the clearest indicator we,217.299,8.53,225.829,angry
have as to your long-term ability to,221.389,6.331,227.72,angry
live with diabetes and not end up with,225.829,3.75,229.579,angry
what they call diabetic complications,227.72,4.71,232.43,angry
which is damage to the body there was a,229.579,5.52,235.09900000000002,angry
test called the DC CT it was done in,232.43,4.739,237.169,angry
America it wasn't a test as a study and,235.099,5.631,240.73,angry
it went on for ten years between 1983 to,237.169,6.781,243.95000000000002,angry
1993 and they took more than a thousand,240.73,5.259,245.98899999999998,angry
people with diabetes you had only had it,243.95,4.2,248.14999999999998,angry
between one and fifteen years and who,245.989,4.47,250.459,angry
had no signs of either nerve damage or,248.15,5.339,253.489,angry
eye damage or kidney damage and they put,250.459,6.541,257.0,angry
them into two groups one had normal,253.489,9.721,263.21,angry
control as per the time frame that they,257.0,6.93,263.93,angry
were history,263.21,1.63,264.84,
how it was,263.93,2.769,266.699,
looked at being controlled back then,264.84,6.03,270.86999999999995,angry
which is 25 years ago at versus what,266.699,6.091,272.79,angry
they called tight control which is,270.87,4.65,275.52,angry
really its carb counting multiple blood,272.79,5.64,278.43,angry
testing multiple injections and they,275.52,6.72,282.24,angry
were able to show that the multiple you,278.43,7.049,285.479,angry
know that the tight control helps stave,282.24,5.82,288.06,angry
off any complications it helped to have,285.479,6.061,291.53999999999996,angry
much better hba1c results and good age,288.06,5.85,293.91,angry
be able to see results lead to a much,291.54,4.08,295.62,angry
better long-term prognosis,293.91,6.33,300.24,angry
so the hba1c is an important number and,295.62,6.42,302.04,angry
you should be getting it looked at at,300.24,4.26,304.5,angry
least every three to six months and if,302.04,3.99,306.03000000000003,angry
the numbers always good and there's no,304.5,4.26,308.76,angry
need to worry but if it's always bad,306.03,5.34,311.36999999999995,angry
then you know you need to keep keep,308.76,4.5,313.26,angry
trying with new medications and new,311.37,3.87,315.24,angry
tools until you can get the balance,313.26,4.62,317.88,angry
right in your life so just two points,315.24,5.34,320.58,angry
about using the hba1c test to diagnose,317.88,6.3,324.18,angry
diabetes if it comes up at as higher,320.58,7.41,327.99,angry
than or greater than 6.5 percent you're,324.18,5.85,330.03000000000003,angry
pretty much defined as having diabetes,327.99,5.82,333.81,angry
if it comes up between six and six point,330.03,5.759,335.789,angry
five you're probably going to get,333.81,4.38,338.19,angry
diagnosed with pre-diabetes or what's,335.789,4.201,339.99,angry
for a while was called at one point five,338.19,4.979,343.169,angry
diabetes as opposed to type one or type,339.99,7.17,347.16,angry
two but if your reading is less than six,343.169,6.151,349.32,angry
percent then you're not considered to be,347.16,5.93,353.09000000000003,angry
either pre-diabetic or diabetic,349.32,3.77,353.09,angry
