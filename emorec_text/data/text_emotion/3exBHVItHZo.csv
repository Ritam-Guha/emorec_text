hello its Lisa here from pens and I'm,3.53,5.55,9.08,sad
going to demonstrate for you how to use,6.56,5.249,11.809,sad
the trusty of a pen properly so the,9.08,4.889,13.969000000000001,sad
first thing I want you to do is take the,11.809,5.941,17.75,sad
pen cap off and we are then going to get,13.969,7.921,21.89,sad
an alcohol way and I want you to wipe,17.75,7.699,25.448999999999998,sad
the tip of the pen needle off to be as,21.89,6.51,28.4,sad
sterile as possible and then what you're,25.449,4.42,29.869,sad
going to do is grab your pen needle,28.4,3.81,32.21,sad
there's a little blue paper tab on the,29.869,4.531,34.4,sad
outside of the needle I just want you to,32.21,5.58,37.79,sad
pull that tab off there there is an,34.4,6.54,40.94,sad
outer pen needle and an inner pen needle,37.79,5.82,43.61,sad
cap so what you're going to do is just,40.94,5.939,46.879,sad
take the needle and kind of press and,43.61,7.5,51.11,sad
then turn clockwise until that it stops,46.879,6.0,52.879,sad
turning and then you're going to take,51.11,4.62,55.73,sad
the outer pen needle off and just place,52.879,4.891,57.769999999999996,sad
it on the table near you you know the,55.73,2.82,58.55,sad
inner pen needle,57.77,4.05,61.82,sad
I want you then to take the inner pen,58.55,5.789,64.339,sad
needle off and immediately discard this,61.82,4.98,66.8,sad
so that you don't accidentally try to,64.339,3.871,68.21,sad
recap the needle and prick yourself,66.8,3.929,70.729,sad
because that wouldn't be fun and what,68.21,4.589,72.79899999999999,sad
you're going to do is give yourself an,70.729,3.661,74.39,sad
air shot and the reason we're doing that,72.799,3.511,76.31,fear
is just to make sure that the pen needle,74.39,3.269,77.659,fear
is clear and you're going to get the,76.31,3.48,79.79,sad
right dose of insulin so what you do is,77.659,3.78,81.43900000000001,sad
you just put your what you're going to,79.79,4.98,84.77000000000001,sad
do first is dial in two units on the pen,81.439,6.031,87.47,sad
dial put your thumb on the little white,84.77,5.489,90.259,sad
button here point it away from you as,87.47,4.35,91.82,sad
you don't make so that we score yourself,90.259,4.081,94.34,sad
and just press until you hear the little,91.82,4.47,96.28999999999999,sad
clip to know that the dose is done and,94.34,4.02,98.36,sad
you should see one to two drops of,96.29,3.57,99.86,sad
insulin come through the tip of the,98.36,3.689,102.049,sad
needle so so that you know we're good,99.86,4.5,104.36,sad
now what you're going to do is dial in,102.049,4.261,106.31,sad
the correct dose of insulin that you,104.36,5.009,109.369,sad
need at that time so for example let's,106.31,5.28,111.59,sad
say I'm going to dial in four units of,109.369,4.381,113.75,sad
insulin so I'm at the number four on the,111.59,5.04,116.63000000000001,sad
pen dial you're going to hold the pen,113.75,6.6,120.35,sad
like a dagger and put your finger on the,116.63,5.76,122.39,sad
little white button there for today's,120.35,3.39,123.74,sad
purposes I'm going to use this little,122.39,4.079,126.469,neutral
cushion here to give the insulin,123.74,4.469,128.209,sad
normally you might want to pinch a,126.469,3.24,129.709,sad
little bit the pen needles are really,128.209,3.341,131.55,sad
short which makes it nice these,129.709,4.181,133.89000000000001,sad
is to use the pen needle that's the,131.55,4.71,136.26000000000002,sad
shortest so you're going to pinch and,133.89,5.16,139.04999999999998,sad
then what you do is just pop the pen in,136.26,6.0,142.26,sad
and press the wait button at the end of,139.05,6.69,145.74,sad
the pen until you hear the click once,142.26,4.62,146.88,sad
you hear the click you know that the,145.74,3.12,148.86,fear
correct dose of insulin has been given,146.88,4.68,151.56,fear
and at that time I want you to count to,148.86,5.25,154.11,fear
10 to make sure that you get the full,151.56,5.19,156.75,fear
dose and there's no leak back so sing a,154.11,4.74,158.85000000000002,fear
song or count one one thousand two one,156.75,4.44,161.19,sad
thousand till you get to ten and then,158.85,4.65,163.5,sad
take the pen needle out and then what,161.19,5.37,166.56,sad
you're going to do is grab the outer pen,163.5,4.89,168.39,sad
needle that we talked about earlier and,166.56,5.37,171.93,sad
just pop it on to the pen needle you,168.39,5.34,173.73,sad
kind of need to squeeze it a little bit,171.93,3.78,175.71,sad
and then turn it counterclockwise until,173.73,4.17,177.89999999999998,sad
it comes off and then you're going to,175.71,5.34,181.05,sad
immediately discard it in a sharps,177.9,6.6,184.5,sad
container and then you're going to recap,181.05,6.54,187.59,sad
your pen and that's it for today's,184.5,5.82,190.32,sad
demonstration of the trace eva pen hope,187.59,5.81,193.4,sad
to see you in pen soon,190.32,3.08,193.4,fear
