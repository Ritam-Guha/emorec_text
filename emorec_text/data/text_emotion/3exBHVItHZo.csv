hello its Lisa here from pens and I'm going to demonstrate for you how to use the trusty of a pen properly so the first thing I want you to do is take the pen cap off and we are then going to get,3.53,29.549999999999997,33.08,sad
an alcohol way and I want you to wipe the tip of the pen needle off to be as sterile as possible and then what you're going to do is grab your pen needle there's a little blue paper tab on the,17.75,26.969999999999995,44.72,sad
outside of the needle I just want you to pull that tab off there there is an outer pen needle and an inner pen needle cap so what you're going to do is just take the needle and kind of press and,32.21,31.379,63.589,sad
then turn clockwise until that it stops turning and then you're going to take the outer pen needle off and just place it on the table near you you know the inner pen needle,46.879,22.381,69.25999999999999,sad
I want you then to take the inner pen needle off and immediately discard this so that you don't accidentally try to recap the needle and prick yourself because that wouldn't be fun and what,58.55,23.158,81.708,sad
you're going to do is give yourself an air shot and the reason we're doing that is just to make sure that the pen needle is clear and you're going to get the right dose of insulin so what you do is,70.729,17.701,88.43,sad
you just put your what you're going to do first is dial in two units on the pen dial put your thumb on the little white button here point it away from you as you don't make so that we score yourself,79.79,24.931,104.721,sad
and just press until you hear the little clip to know that the dose is done and you should see one to two drops of insulin come through the tip of the needle so so that you know we're good,91.82,20.249,112.06899999999999,sad
now what you're going to do is dial in the correct dose of insulin that you need at that time so for example let's say I'm going to dial in four units of insulin so I'm at the number four on the,102.049,23.971,126.02000000000001,sad
pen dial you're going to hold the pen like a dagger and put your finger on the little white button there for today's purposes I'm going to use this little cushion here to give the insulin,113.75,24.298000000000002,138.048,sad
normally you might want to pinch a little bit the pen needles are really short which makes it nice these is to use the pen needle that's the shortest so you're going to pinch and,126.469,20.632,147.101,sad
then what you do is just pop the pen in and press the wait button at the end of the pen until you hear the click once you hear the click you know that the correct dose of insulin has been given,136.26,25.110000000000003,161.37,sad
and at that time I want you to count to 10 to make sure that you get the full dose and there's no leak back so sing a song or count one one thousand two one thousand till you get to ten and then,148.86,24.270000000000003,173.13000000000002,sad
take the pen needle out and then what you're going to do is grab the outer pen needle that we talked about earlier and just pop it on to the pen needle you kind of need to squeeze it a little bit,161.19,24.75,185.94,sad
and then turn it counterclockwise until it comes off and then you're going to immediately discard it in a sharps container and then you're going to recap your pen and that's it for today's,173.73,28.47,202.2,sad
