hello its Lisa here from pens and I'm,3.53,5.55,9.08,surprise
going to demonstrate for you how to use,6.56,5.249,11.809,surprise
the trusty of a pen properly so the,9.08,4.889,13.969000000000001,surprise
first thing I want you to do is take the,11.809,5.941,17.75,surprise
pen cap off and we are then going to get,13.969,7.921,21.89,surprise
an alcohol way and I want you to wipe,17.75,7.699,25.448999999999998,surprise
the tip of the pen needle off to be as,21.89,6.51,28.4,surprise
sterile as possible and then what you're,25.449,4.42,29.869,surprise
going to do is grab your pen needle,28.4,3.81,32.21,surprise
there's a little blue paper tab on the,29.869,4.531,34.4,surprise
outside of the needle I just want you to,32.21,5.58,37.79,fear
pull that tab off there there is an,34.4,6.54,40.94,surprise
outer pen needle and an inner pen needle,37.79,5.82,43.61,surprise
cap so what you're going to do is just,40.94,5.939,46.879,neutral
take the needle and kind of press and,43.61,7.5,51.11,fear
then turn clockwise until that it stops,46.879,6.0,52.879,fear
turning and then you're going to take,51.11,4.62,55.73,surprise
the outer pen needle off and just place,52.879,4.891,57.769999999999996,surprise
it on the table near you you know the,55.73,2.82,58.55,fear
inner pen needle,57.77,4.05,61.82,fear
I want you then to take the inner pen,58.55,5.789,64.339,surprise
needle off and immediately discard this,61.82,4.98,66.8,surprise
so that you don't accidentally try to,64.339,3.871,68.21,fear
recap the needle and prick yourself,66.8,3.929,70.729,fear
because that wouldn't be fun and what,68.21,4.589,72.79899999999999,fear
you're going to do is give yourself an,70.729,3.661,74.39,surprise
air shot and the reason we're doing that,72.799,3.511,76.31,surprise
is just to make sure that the pen needle,74.39,3.269,77.659,surprise
is clear and you're going to get the,76.31,3.48,79.79,surprise
right dose of insulin so what you do is,77.659,3.78,81.43900000000001,surprise
you just put your what you're going to,79.79,4.98,84.77000000000001,fear
do first is dial in two units on the pen,81.439,6.031,87.47,surprise
dial put your thumb on the little white,84.77,5.489,90.259,surprise
button here point it away from you as,87.47,4.35,91.82,surprise
you don't make so that we score yourself,90.259,4.081,94.34,angry
and just press until you hear the little,91.82,4.47,96.28999999999999,angry
clip to know that the dose is done and,94.34,4.02,98.36,fear
you should see one to two drops of,96.29,3.57,99.86,fear
insulin come through the tip of the,98.36,3.689,102.049,fear
needle so so that you know we're good,99.86,4.5,104.36,fear
now what you're going to do is dial in,102.049,4.261,106.31,surprise
the correct dose of insulin that you,104.36,5.009,109.369,surprise
need at that time so for example let's,106.31,5.28,111.59,surprise
say I'm going to dial in four units of,109.369,4.381,113.75,neutral
insulin so I'm at the number four on the,111.59,5.04,116.63000000000001,neutral
pen dial you're going to hold the pen,113.75,6.6,120.35,neutral
like a dagger and put your finger on the,116.63,5.76,122.39,fear
little white button there for today's,120.35,3.39,123.74,fear
purposes I'm going to use this little,122.39,4.079,126.469,neutral
cushion here to give the insulin,123.74,4.469,128.209,neutral
normally you might want to pinch a,126.469,3.24,129.709,angry
little bit the pen needles are really,128.209,3.341,131.55,surprise
short which makes it nice these,129.709,4.181,133.89000000000001,surprise
is to use the pen needle that's the,131.55,4.71,136.26000000000002,neutral
shortest so you're going to pinch and,133.89,5.16,139.04999999999998,neutral
then what you do is just pop the pen in,136.26,6.0,142.26,neutral
and press the wait button at the end of,139.05,6.69,145.74,fear
the pen until you hear the click once,142.26,4.62,146.88,fear
you hear the click you know that the,145.74,3.12,148.86,surprise
correct dose of insulin has been given,146.88,4.68,151.56,surprise
and at that time I want you to count to,148.86,5.25,154.11,surprise
10 to make sure that you get the full,151.56,5.19,156.75,surprise
dose and there's no leak back so sing a,154.11,4.74,158.85000000000002,surprise
song or count one one thousand two one,156.75,4.44,161.19,surprise
thousand till you get to ten and then,158.85,4.65,163.5,angry
take the pen needle out and then what,161.19,5.37,166.56,surprise
you're going to do is grab the outer pen,163.5,4.89,168.39,surprise
needle that we talked about earlier and,166.56,5.37,171.93,surprise
just pop it on to the pen needle you,168.39,5.34,173.73,neutral
kind of need to squeeze it a little bit,171.93,3.78,175.71,fear
and then turn it counterclockwise until,173.73,4.17,177.89999999999998,fear
it comes off and then you're going to,175.71,5.34,181.05,fear
immediately discard it in a sharps,177.9,6.6,184.5,fear
container and then you're going to recap,181.05,6.54,187.59,fear
your pen and that's it for today's,184.5,5.82,190.32,surprise
