I would never in a million years have guessed that ten days after surgery I would be out running around shop and walking the neighborhood life is grand the first couple of days,0.0,21.418,21.418,NA
are the hardest four days later I feel like a new person I was able to get up get out of bed walk around tolerate fluids get a shower it's just this little incision and you know you take,10.559,26.581,37.14,NA
your bandage off you get in the shower you let the warm soapy water run over it doesn't hurt at all it just it heals from the inside out and it'll eventually close on its own I am now eating chicken,24.66,19.441000000000003,44.101,NA

checking your turkey it's got to be moist I have learned that your bites have to be very small that's been a big challenge you use I'm used to taking a big bite and then chew in it up fairly,45.3,24.419,69.719,NA
small and then swallowing now your bites literally need to be about the size of an eraser on a pencil and so that's that's a big change and then you need to chew that very thoroughly because it,56.55,23.311,79.86099999999999,NA

morning breakfast was half a scrambled egg I think I expected that I would go in and I would have surgery I would feel bad for a month or so I would slowly get to moving around maybe tolerating a,82.049,26.611,108.66000000000001,NA
little bit of fluid here and there and that it would just be this long drawn-out process of recovery I'm ten days out and I think day six I was out shopping I mean really it's been amazing,95.31,25.399,120.709,NA
amazing I am down 23 pounds since starting the liquid diet 10 days before surgery I'm wearing jeans I haven't worn in two years I mean that was just talk about a happy moment I think I did like,107.18,28.06,135.24,angry
I said a little happy dance that I was able to put these jeans on I'm wearing blouses that I couldn't wear before that because they were so tight around my midsection,121.89,15.741,137.631,angry

walk around it's easier to sit in the chair when you go somewhere it's that little bit starting off has set me on fire in the next thirty days I should expect another 15 to 20 pounds of weight,140.56,23.67,164.23000000000002,NA
loss then after that I'm looking at a pound and a half to two pounds per week I have not been hungry at all I've not felt the first hunger pain at all it's and it's the oddest feeling sometimes,151.84,24.540000000000006,176.38,NA

hope that I won't be obese forever that I would I do I feel better already so there's this there's this fire that's been instilled in me and now to how much better can I feel when I lose 60 pounds,186.01,26.130000000000003,212.14,NA
when I lose 80 pounds what's life going to be like then because right right now life is grand I think if people really knew that you can do this it's not horrible it just takes commitment I mean,199.78,30.869999999999997,230.65,NA
you you have to be mentally prepared to do this and once you get to that point that you're mentally prepared it's there's no stopping it's amazing it's it's not as scary as I thought it would,215.62,23.13,238.75,NA
