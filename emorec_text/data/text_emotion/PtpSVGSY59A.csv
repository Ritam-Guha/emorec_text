I would never in a million years have,0.0,4.83,4.83,
guessed that ten days after surgery I,2.61,3.93,6.54,
would be out running around shop and,4.83,2.88,7.71,
walking the neighborhood,6.54,4.019,10.559000000000001,
life is grand the first couple of days,7.71,5.759,13.469000000000001,
are the hardest four days later I feel,10.559,4.95,15.509,
like a new person I was able to get up,13.469,4.681,18.15,fear
get out of bed walk around tolerate,15.509,5.131,20.64,fear
fluids get a shower it's just this,18.15,6.51,24.659999999999997,
little incision and you know you take,20.64,5.309,25.949,
your bandage off you get in the shower,24.66,3.18,27.84,
you let the warm soapy water run over it,25.949,3.781,29.73,
doesn't hurt at all it just it heals,27.84,3.0,30.84,
from the inside out and it'll eventually,29.73,3.63,33.36,
close on its own I am now eating chicken,30.84,5.85,36.69,
and fish shrimp eggs cottage cheese,33.36,4.289,37.649,fear

food is moist I mean definitely you're,43.379,3.691,47.07,
checking your turkey it's got to be,45.3,5.579,50.879,
moist I have learned that your bites,47.07,6.3,53.37,
have to be very small that's been a big,50.879,4.11,54.989,
challenge you use I'm used to taking a,53.37,3.18,56.55,
big bite and then chew in it up fairly,54.989,5.25,60.239,
small and then swallowing now your bites,56.55,5.43,61.98,
literally need to be about the size of,60.239,4.081,64.32,fear
an eraser on a pencil and so that's,61.98,4.26,66.24,fear
that's a big change and then you need to,64.32,3.99,68.30999999999999,fear
chew that very thoroughly because it,66.24,5.55,71.78999999999999,
will hurt going down otherwise so forces,68.31,5.849,74.159,
you to slow down but I was amazed I had,71.79,4.8,76.59,
a piece of fish yesterday just a little,74.159,5.011,79.17,fear
too obviously I think I ate maybe a,76.59,5.459,82.049,fear
third of it and was too full and this,79.17,4.5,83.67,fear
morning breakfast was half a scrambled,82.049,5.191,87.24000000000001,fear
egg I think I expected that I would go,83.67,5.58,89.25,fear
in and I would have surgery I would feel,87.24,5.669,92.90899999999999,fear
bad for a month or so I would slowly get,89.25,6.06,95.31,fear
to moving around maybe tolerating a,92.909,4.111,97.02000000000001,
little bit of fluid here and there and,95.31,3.33,98.64,
that it would just be this long,97.02,4.98,102.0,
drawn-out process of recovery I'm ten,98.64,5.189,103.82900000000001,
days out and I think day six I was out,102.0,5.18,107.18,

surgery I'm wearing jeans I haven't worn,112.47,6.63,119.1,fear
in two years I mean that was just talk,115.079,6.811,121.88999999999999,fear
about a happy moment I think I did like,119.1,4.799,123.899,fear
I said a little happy dance that I was,121.89,3.689,125.57900000000001,fear
able to put these jeans on I'm wearing,123.899,3.661,127.56,fear
blouses that I couldn't wear before that,125.579,3.24,128.819,fear
because they were so tight around my,127.56,2.29,129.85,surprise
midsection,128.819,2.861,131.67999999999998,surprise
it's embarrassing nobody wants to look,129.85,4.53,134.38,fear
like that so I wear blouses now that I,131.68,5.55,137.23000000000002,fear
couldn't wear before everything it's,134.38,4.44,138.82,fear
just that little bit of weight it's it's,137.23,3.33,140.56,fear
easier to do anything it's easier to,138.82,3.45,142.26999999999998,fear
walk around it's easier to sit in the,140.56,3.99,144.55,fear
chair when you go somewhere it's that,142.27,4.29,146.56,fear
little bit starting off has set me on,144.55,4.47,149.02,fear
fire in the next thirty days I should,146.56,5.28,151.84,fear
expect another 15 to 20 pounds of weight,149.02,5.64,154.66,
loss then after that I'm looking at a,151.84,4.44,156.28,
pound and a half to two pounds per week,154.66,5.16,159.82,
I have not been hungry at all I've not,156.28,6.42,162.7,
felt the first hunger pain at all it's,159.82,4.74,164.56,
and it's the oddest feeling sometimes,162.7,3.78,166.48,
you think my goodness it's dinnertime,164.56,3.57,168.13,neutral
you know it's a speed the kids you know,166.48,3.84,170.32,neutral
see the family and why I'm not even,168.13,2.76,170.89,neutral
hungry,170.32,2.67,172.98999999999998,neutral
you don't think about food all the time,170.89,4.29,175.17999999999998,
anymore whereas that food was,172.99,4.89,177.88,
controlling me before this now I can,175.18,5.34,180.52,
control it for the first time in years I,177.88,6.51,184.39,fear
have hope about my weight I mean I don't,180.52,5.49,186.01000000000002,
even know how to express that I have,184.39,5.97,190.35999999999999,
hope that I won't be obese forever that,186.01,7.02,193.03,
I would I do I feel better already so,190.36,5.28,195.64000000000001,fear
there's this there's this fire that's,193.03,4.23,197.26,fear
been instilled in me and now to how much,195.64,4.14,199.77999999999997,fear
better can I feel when I lose 60 pounds,197.26,5.46,202.72,fear
when I lose 80 pounds what's life going,199.78,5.49,205.27,fear
to be like then because right right now,202.72,6.9,209.62,fear
life is grand I think if people really,205.27,7.38,212.65,neutral
knew that you can do this it's not,209.62,6.0,215.62,fear
horrible it just takes commitment I mean,212.65,5.1,217.75,
you you have to be mentally prepared to,215.62,4.08,219.70000000000002,
do this and once you get to that point,217.75,4.41,222.16,
that you're mentally prepared it's,219.7,4.68,224.38,
there's no stopping it's amazing it's,222.16,4.8,226.96,fear
it's not as scary as I thought it would,224.38,5.16,229.54,fear
be I was terrified in the beginning now,226.96,4.26,231.22,fear
I just want everyone to know it's not,229.54,5.23,234.76999999999998,
that bad just be committed,231.22,3.62,234.84,
