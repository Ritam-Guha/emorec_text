hello dr. Burke here in this video we're going to talk about peripheral neuropathy now we're going to relate this to diabetes there's other conditions that you can have it as well,0.0,17.34,17.34,angry
but what is it basically the sensation of pain burning pain numbness numbness and tingling or any combination thereof on your hands or your feet okay and so what happens in diabetes it's one of the,8.16,31.769,39.929,angry
symptoms that you want to watch out for when you start experiencing that it's starting to advance a little bit too deep in the body now the reason why it's affecting the hands and the feet first,24.51,19.141,43.650999999999996,angry
is simply because those nerves are the longest so if you envision having this tube of carrying oxygen and nutrition the very end of that tube is going to experience the deficiency burst right,34.14,24.09,58.230000000000004,angry
because it has to go all the way over there same thing with the hands in the feet now what causes this is the high levels of sugar in the blood causing micro vascular injury the body does not,46.44,29.07,75.50999999999999,angry
like too much sugar it's toxic so it creates very small arterial or vascular injury to the nervous system so the blood vessels that feed the nerves get disrupted okay that's number one,59.94,32.638999999999996,92.579,angry
number two glycated end-products now what is that that's just another mechanism that you have this protein that's building up because the high sugar on the nerves stopping the flow of,77.1,21.089,98.189,angry
nerve impulses okay number three vitamin b12 deficiency or vitamin b1 deficiency okay both of those vitamins control the synthesis of mild in around the nerve myelin is the kind of the fat insulator,86.939,29.642000000000003,116.58099999999999,angry
of the nerve just like if you had a wire you have this plastic or rubber insulation myelin is the fat insulation around the nerve well if you don't have the b12 or the b1 you're not going to,102.6,21.419999999999998,124.02,angry
make the insulation so that's going to go away so you're going to start short-circuiting that electrical flow and start getting all sorts of nerve issues okay so now what is the solution,113.46,22.839,136.29899999999998,angry
well number one you've got to fix the sugar problem which is an insulin problem I'm going to put some links down below and secondly you need to start taking b12 and b1 I would,124.1,22.500999999999998,146.601,angry
get those in a fat soluble form in addition to that you want to also consume nutritional yeast because diabetics or people that are pre-diabetics tend to always have,135.62,24.869999999999997,160.49,NA
deficiencies of these two vitamins and a lot of other ones so you need a little bit more nutritional yeast you can get it from any health food store all right thanks for watching hey if you haven't,148.25,18.81,167.06,NA
