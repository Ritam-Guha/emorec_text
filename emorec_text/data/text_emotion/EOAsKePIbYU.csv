come alongside PCOS otherwise known as,3.959,5.1,9.059,fear
polycystic ovary syndrome when I was,6.96,3.84,10.8,fear

words like infertility and type 2,12.769,4.84,17.609,fear
diabetes were being thrown around me at,15.719,3.511,19.23,fear
doctor's appointments and I was,17.609,4.711,22.32,fear
terrified no idea what was going on for,19.23,5.85,25.08,fear
those of you not in the know lucky you,22.32,5.219,27.539,fear
polycystic ovary syndrome is a very,25.08,3.99,29.07,fear

specifically estrogen testosterone and,35.579,6.121,41.7,fear
insulin there are a couple of widely,38.43,5.37,43.8,fear
known symptoms that come alongside PCOS,41.7,4.62,46.32,fear
but there are several that nobody talks,43.8,4.41,48.209999999999994,fear
about and that I am still learning about,46.32,4.82,51.14,fear
the most common side effect PCOS is,48.21,5.31,53.52,fear
irregular periods which can often lead,51.14,3.82,54.96,fear
to difficulties when it comes to,53.52,3.48,57.0,fear
conceiving other symptoms include,54.96,4.56,59.52,fear
excessive hair growth weight gain and,57.0,4.98,61.980000000000004,

the symptoms which affect women with,61.98,3.359,65.339,neutral

resistance going up I had some of these,79.5,4.5,84.0,fear
symptoms but in recent years I've,81.78,3.51,85.29,fear
learned that the ones that aren't,84.0,3.54,87.54,fear
readily discussed all the time are the,85.29,4.439,89.72900000000001,fear
ones that affected and continue to,87.54,3.869,91.409,fear
affect me when I was first diagnosed,89.729,4.021,93.75,fear
with PCOS it was a very confusing time I,91.409,5.1,96.509,fear
was becoming a teenager which in itself,93.75,5.1,98.85,fear
is a very confusing time but a teenager,96.509,5.4,101.909,fear
with PCOS I was making silly life,98.85,6.93,105.78,
choices I was going for fad diets and,101.909,6.39,108.299,
that as a habit that I'm still trying to,105.78,5.4,111.18,fear
break however symptoms like my mental,108.299,4.32,112.619,fear
health was something that I was never,111.18,3.689,114.869,fear
told about throughout my late teens and,112.619,6.42,119.039,fear
my 20s I felt like I was going crazy,114.869,5.79,120.659,fear
I was experiencing some of the highest,119.039,4.171,123.21000000000001,fear
highs and the lowest lows and it wasn't,120.659,5.161,125.82000000000001,fear
until I realized that other women who,123.21,4.74,127.94999999999999,fear
have PCOS were also going through the,125.82,3.63,129.45,fear
same emotions I awaked,127.95,3.75,131.7,fear
and my mental health are something that,129.45,5.88,135.32999999999998,fear
often go hand in hand and my fluctuating,131.7,5.49,137.19,fear
weight gain has been incredibly,135.33,4.439,139.769,neutral
exhausting to work through from my own,137.19,4.53,141.72,fear
personal experience and from what I was,139.769,4.47,144.239,fear
told when I was younger and as I could,141.72,4.56,146.28,fear
control my weight which was a direct,144.239,5.25,149.489,neutral
result of having PCOS the seven times,146.28,5.67,151.95,fear
all of my PCOS would significantly,149.489,4.351,153.84,fear
decrease which would then improve my,151.95,5.34,157.29,fear
fertility so suddenly it became ironic,153.84,5.88,159.72,fear
that the weight that I held became the,157.29,4.38,161.67,fear
weight on my shoulders people often,159.72,5.01,164.73,fear
thought that my PCOS was an excuse for,161.67,4.62,166.29,fear
me being overweight and it still bothers,164.73,4.2,168.92999999999998,fear
me when I get comments about it because,166.29,5.22,171.51,fear
I don't know how to tell someone that,168.93,3.99,172.92000000000002,fear
their diet,171.51,3.21,174.72,neutral
or their workout plan may not,172.92,3.69,176.60999999999999,fear
necessarily affect me in the same way it,174.72,3.989,178.709,fear
