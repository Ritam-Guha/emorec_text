today we're going to talk about a,0.03,4.53,4.5600000000000005,fear
nutrient called benfotiamine and this is,1.469,7.771,9.24,fear
a synthetic b1 b1 is naturally water,4.56,9.18,13.739999999999998,fear
Seibel this is a fat-soluble b1 and yes,9.24,7.83,17.07,neutral
it is made synthetically but this is one,13.74,5.25,18.990000000000002,neutral
of the only synthetic vitamins that I,17.07,3.42,20.490000000000002,neutral
would recommend because it has virtually,18.99,4.35,23.339999999999996,neutral
no side effects and I believe every,20.49,4.799,25.288999999999998,sad
single diabetic should be taking,23.34,3.63,26.97,NA
benfotiamine and here's why because,25.289,5.64,30.929000000000002,NA
vitamin b1 is intimately involved in the,26.97,6.63,33.6,fear
little mini engine in your mitochondria,30.929,5.581,36.51,fear
that involves the glucose metabolism and,33.6,5.61,39.21,NA
the more glucose that you have running,36.51,4.44,40.949999999999996,fear
through that machine the higher the,39.21,5.34,44.55,fear
blood sugar the more depleted of b1,40.95,6.24,47.190000000000005,fear
you're going to become and with,44.55,5.7,50.25,NA
diabetics there's four main tissues that,47.19,5.939,53.129,NA
are involved the nerves and brain the,50.25,5.75,56.0,NA
eyes the kidney and the heart vessels,53.129,5.151,58.28,happy
and it just so happens that benfotiamine,56.0,5.109,61.109,neutral
can help you with each one of them now,58.28,5.949,64.229,neutral
because benfotiamine is fat soluble it,61.109,6.091,67.2,neutral
can penetrate 3 to 5 times deeper into,64.229,5.221,69.45,neutral
the nerves in your brain and it can,67.2,4.25,71.45,NA
really create some really cool effects,69.45,5.66,75.11,fear
its main function is it protects against,71.45,6.54,77.99000000000001,fear
oxidation and this is really that the,75.11,6.07,81.18,fear
problem with diabetes you have so much,77.99,5.29,83.28,fear
glucose involved that the amount of,81.18,3.93,85.11000000000001,NA
oxidation is so high you're getting all,83.28,3.72,87.0,NA
sorts of free radical damage you're,85.11,4.32,89.43,NA
getting complications all the tissues,87.0,4.35,91.35,NA
start breaking down simply because of,89.43,4.47,93.9,NA
the oxidation of glucose well any type,91.35,4.74,96.08999999999999,NA
of b1 will counter that but benfotiamine,93.9,4.14,98.04,NA
goes a little bit deeper benfotiamine,96.09,6.8,102.89,NA
will also reduce advanced glycation,98.04,7.17,105.21000000000001,NA
end-products now what is that when you,102.89,4.36,107.25,NA
combine glucose with the protein or,105.21,5.159,110.369,NA
glucose with the fat under heat you,107.25,5.67,112.92,NA
start creating these these sticky,110.369,5.64,116.009,NA
proteins now your body can make these or,112.92,5.159,118.07900000000001,NA
you can consume them in certain foods so,116.009,3.691,119.7,NA
if you took like barbecued ribs for,118.079,3.72,121.79899999999999,NA
example where they are cooking this,119.7,5.699,125.399,NA
sugar with meat or even ice cream where,121.799,5.881,127.68,NA
you have a lot of sugar you have the,125.399,4.92,130.319,NA
milk protein and fat all cooked up,127.68,4.29,131.97,NA
that's going to give you a lot of these,130.319,3.211,133.53,NA
and this will basically,131.97,4.56,136.53,NA
add more oxidation accelerate the aging,133.53,5.88,139.41,NA
process create a lot of sticky proteins,136.53,4.98,141.51,NA
that get stuck in your arteries your,139.41,4.68,144.09,NA
brain your eyes and it creates a lot of,141.51,4.62,146.13,NA
other issues benfotiamine can also,144.09,4.92,149.01,NA
decrease your a1c as well now the main,146.13,4.17,150.29999999999998,NA
way that I used it when I was in,149.01,4.32,153.32999999999998,NA
practice is for peripheral neuropathy,150.3,4.65,154.95000000000002,NA
and that's a condition where you have a,153.33,3.27,156.60000000000002,NA
breakdown the nervous system in your,154.95,4.32,159.26999999999998,NA
feet or your fingertips so you might,156.6,5.82,162.42,NA
have pain in your feet or numbness or,159.27,5.85,165.12,NA
burning pain making you difficult to,162.42,5.58,168.0,NA
walk this stuff works like magic you'd,165.12,7.05,172.17000000000002,NA
want to take at least 600 milligrams per,168.0,7.05,175.05,NA
day and you can spread it out I don't,172.17,4.68,176.85,NA
have any specific benfotiamine to,175.05,3.6,178.65,NA
recommend you're gonna have to do your,176.85,3.63,180.48,NA
own research to find something that,178.65,3.96,182.61,NA
maybe has some good reviews but if,180.48,3.86,184.34,NA
you're a diabetic and you have feet pain,182.61,4.86,187.47000000000003,NA
this will work like magic so it's really,184.34,5.8,190.14000000000001,NA
good for restoring nerve function it's,187.47,4.8,192.27,NA
good for pain it's good for any type of,190.14,4.319,194.45899999999997,NA
neuropathies and it's also good to,192.27,5.34,197.61,neutral
protect the brain against diabetic,194.459,5.131,199.59,NA
complications because a lot of times a,197.61,4.47,202.08,NA
diabetic will have dementia to have,199.59,5.369,204.959,NA
memory loss I mean type 3 diabetes is,202.08,5.37,207.45000000000002,NA
Alzheimer's so it can actually help that,204.959,5.191,210.15,NA
condition greatly now as far as the eyes,207.45,5.52,212.97,NA
go there's a lot of secondary,210.15,6.27,216.42000000000002,NA
complications from diabetes concerning,212.97,5.79,218.76,NA
the eye and one is damage to the retina,216.42,4.95,221.36999999999998,NA
well guess what the retina is all nerve,218.76,5.31,224.07,NA
tissue so benfotiamine is really good,221.37,5.839,227.209,NA
for the retina to protect against damage,224.07,5.85,229.92,NA
it's also good to protect against the,227.209,4.721,231.93,NA
kidney cell called a nephron so if,229.92,3.72,233.64,NA
someone has kidney damage let's say they,231.93,4.14,236.07,NA
have stage three or four even five this,233.64,3.56,237.2,NA
is something I would highly recommend,236.07,3.33,239.4,NA
then we have the heart in the heart,237.2,5.379,242.57899999999998,NA
vessels there's a certain layer on the,239.4,4.95,244.35,NA
inside of the artery called the,242.579,6.181,248.76000000000002,NA
epithelial layer and the microvascular,244.35,6.06,250.41,NA
the tiny little blood vessels that,248.76,5.039,253.79899999999998,NA
innervate that can be protected when you,250.41,5.669,256.079,NA
take benefit Amin in fact if you're,253.799,6.831,260.63,NA
deficient in B one of Miss important,256.079,7.501,263.58,NA
antioxidant and you can develop damage,260.63,5.08,265.71,NA
dysfunction and then guess what,263.58,3.69,267.27,NA
cholesterol builds up,265.71,3.42,269.13,NA
calcium builds up and you start getting,267.27,4.08,271.34999999999997,NA
plaque in the arteries so benfotiamine,269.13,5.069,274.199,NA
is very very important in cardiovascular,271.35,5.999,277.34900000000005,NA
function and act to protect the arteries,274.199,5.4,279.599,NA
and of course I'm assuming that you're a,277.349,4.591,281.94,neutral
regular viewer because if you're not I'm,279.599,6.931,286.53,NA
also gonna recommend healthy keto okay,281.94,8.569,290.509,NA
and in a minute fasting as the basic,286.53,7.229,293.75899999999996,NA
diet that you need to do in addition to,290.509,4.991,295.5,NA
this because if you're doing this,293.759,4.981,298.74,NA
without correcting the diet it might not,295.5,5.07,300.57,NA
work as well I put a link down below,298.74,3.57,302.31,NA
