hello everyone my name is dr. Myers I am,2.54,5.979,8.519,
a practicing endocrinologist at Columbia,5.85,5.13,10.98,neutral
Hospital highball and I have my own,8.519,3.66,12.179,
clinic in Vijay Nagar,10.98,4.02,15.0,
which is known as health routes clinics,12.179,6.221,18.4,
[Music],15.0,6.94,21.94,
in any condition some normal or,18.4,6.73,25.13,
pre-diabetes or having diabetes the,21.94,6.88,28.82,
blood glucose level will increase after,25.13,7.65,32.78,
eating food or taking any glucose or any,28.82,8.04,36.86,
other eatables or liquid substance so it,32.78,7.17,39.95,neutral
the amount of glucose excursion depends,36.86,5.699,42.559,neutral
on two factors one is the body's ability,39.95,5.28,45.230000000000004,neutral
to metabolize so the form we take it in,42.559,4.891,47.449999999999996,neutral
whether it is a solid or a liquid form,45.23,4.59,49.81999999999999,neutral
second is whether it is containing,47.45,4.35,51.800000000000004,neutral
simple sugars or it contains complex,49.82,4.41,54.230000000000004,neutral
sugars with fat and protein if it,51.8,5.13,56.93,neutral
contains simple sugars the blood glucose,54.23,5.09,59.31999999999999,neutral
levels after 30 minutes can range from,56.93,5.879,62.809,neutral
anything between 100 to up to 200 or,59.32,7.18,66.5,neutral
sometimes even 250 if we take food that,62.809,6.631,69.44,neutral
is rich in complex carbohydrates with,66.5,5.37,71.87,neutral
fiber content and fat then the glucose,69.44,4.41,73.85,neutral
excursion is not very high it may just,71.87,5.4,77.27000000000001,neutral
reach around the 100 240 or hundred and,73.85,6.27,80.11999999999999,neutral
60 so if you take a fruit juice or,77.27,5.879,83.149,neutral
simple sugar drink or eat food like,80.12,6.209,86.32900000000001,neutral
white rice and potato rich food then the,83.149,5.671,88.82000000000001,neutral
sugar levels will really go high even,86.329,4.801,91.13,neutral
after 30 minutes it can reach up to 200,88.82,4.92,93.74,neutral
or even more than that sometimes but if,91.13,4.62,95.75,neutral
you take food that is rich in fiber and,93.74,4.68,98.41999999999999,neutral
low in carbohydrate then the glucose,95.75,5.789,101.539,neutral
levels will go from 100 to maximum 140,98.42,5.64,104.06,neutral
sometimes once it doesn't go so high,101.539,5.61,107.149,
because it blows my body metabolizes eat,104.06,5.25,109.31,
it when a slow thing and if you take,107.149,4.351,111.5,
solid foods also the glucose excursion,109.31,4.739,114.049,
will be a little late as compared to the,111.5,5.579,117.079,NA
liquid freedom so glucose levels can,114.049,4.951,119.0,NA
vary depending on the type of food and,117.079,5.43,122.50899999999999,NA
the form in which we take that is the,119.0,5.429,124.429,NA
liquid form and whether it is,122.509,4.881,127.39,NA
carbohydrate rich,124.429,2.961,127.39,NA
you,127.88,2.059,129.939,NA
