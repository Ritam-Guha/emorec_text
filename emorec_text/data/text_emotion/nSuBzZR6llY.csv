"The skin condition called Acanthosis Nigricans
fortunately is uncommon, but pseudo Acanthosis Nigricans unfortunately
isn’t. If you were formally schooled in Latin, you
know exactly what I’m talking about. But if you weren’t, stay tuned! Let’s start with what Acanthosis Nigricans,",0.12,27.330000000000002,27.450000000000003,NA
"which I'm going to refer to as AN in this
episode. Start with what it looks like, which’ll
then make you want to know more. And just to make it a little more interesting, the real Acanthosis Nigricans and “faux”
Acanthosis Nigricans, which is the more common Pseudo Acanthosis
Nigricans, look essentially identical.",27.45,18.490000000000002,45.94,NA
"Since Acanthosis just means a thickening or
overgrowth of the upper layer of your skin and Nigricans
really means dark or black, if we put this together its really a descriptive
term from which you expect to see a dark overgrowth or thickening
of your skin. Acanthosis Nigricans appears as tan to dark
brown velvety surfaced plaques",45.94,19.310000000000002,65.25,NA
"with parallel lines which when even deeper
look like velvety parallel ribs like the nap of carpeting. You usually get it on the parts of the body
where skin tends to rub against skin, such as underarms, neck and upper inner thighs, but it can occur in other areas as well.",65.25,17.18,82.43,angry
"Because these brown, raised, unattractive
patches and plaques don’t itch or burn or in any other way bother
you except cosmetically, which is personally important and a real quality
of life issue, the medical importance of Acanthosis Nigricans
is why it occurs and whether it reflects something important
internally.",82.43,18.95,101.38000000000001,NA
"Most cases of Acanthosis Nigricans are not
true Acanthosis Nigricans, but fortunately the Pseudo form which occurs
from being overweight. The real Acanthosis Nigricans comes from certain
endocrine diseases such as diabetes, polycystic ovary syndrome, other less common hormonal imbalances,",101.38,16.44,117.82,NA
"But and most importantly, Acanthosis Nigricans
can be a reflection of an internal cancer which most commonly are malignancies of the
gastrointestinal tract, uterus and sometimes even the lung, prostate,
breast or ovary. And last there are some people who have Acanthosis
Nigricans with no apparent associated disease and are
not overweight.",117.82,23.16,140.98,NA
"For the first group whose Acanthosis is associated
with obesity, endocrine problems or cancers, treating the
underlying condition will result in a remarkable improvement of the Acanthosis, but what about those people who fortunately
don’t have an underlying disease causing this",140.98,15.940000000000001,156.92,NA
"but still have the cosmetic impact of thickened
brown skin? For those people there are ways of minimizing the cosmetic impact of this unusual rash. Because it’s caused by thickening and darkening
of the skin, treatment with products that bleach the extra
brown",156.92,15.76,172.67999999999998,NA
"and reduce the dead layers of the skin are
helpful. So believe it or not, even with the unusual, here we are back to treatment with exfoliants
and bleaches once again.",172.68,23.5,196.18,NA
