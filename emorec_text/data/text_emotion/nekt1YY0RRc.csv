another very important topic that we want to talk about today is pre-diabetes the diagnosed cases of diabetes is only the tip of the iceberg,15.04,22.961,38.001,sad
so if you see the numbers in hand we have around 77 million people suffering from diabetes but in india itself all across the world the number goes up to,26.32,22.479999999999997,48.8,sad
around 400 millions and it's going to touch very soon to 600 million by the time we're in 2035 but a much much larger number are having,37.76,21.198,58.958,sad
pre-diabetes who had not yet been diagnosed and will be having diabetes very shortly if they do not make major lifestyle changes,48.879,22.48,71.359,sad
reduce their weight stop smoking start walking and things like that now pre-diabetes is a stage where the sugar levels are high,59.359,24.48,83.839,sad
higher than usual but it has not touched the zone which we can classify as diabetes so conventionally we do a fasting sugar we do a prandtl sugar that is the after,71.439,23.921,95.35999999999999,sad
meal sugar and we also do an average of the past three months sugar which we call hba1c so what is the diagnostic criteria of pre-diabetes,84.4,22.000999999999998,106.40100000000001,sad
so anyone who has got their fasting level between 100 and 126 or the after meal sugar between 140 and 200,94.56,21.958999999999996,116.519,sad
or the average sugar hba1c between 5.7 and 6.4 would be considered pre-diabetic the importance of pre-diabetes is that this is that particular place where,105.119,29.64,134.75900000000001,sad

first place for those kind of individuals we need to have a screening program where we do at least annually one test that is hpa1c or the average blood sugar,134.8,27.599999999999998,162.4,sad
to detect whether they have already started developing diabetes or predisposed to be having diabetes at a later life and these are the,148.0,19.28,167.28,NA
