Ellie: it's difficult to describe acromegaly",0.0,20.15,20.15,surprise
"to people. It's extremely hard. You can give
them resources and show them the definitions,",20.15,6.629,26.778999999999996,
"but unless you're experiencing it, there
really is no way to describe it to people.",26.779,7.071,33.85,
"My name is Ellie Kolosovsky and I was diagnosed
in 2010 with acromegaly. My first symptoms",33.85,6.869,40.719,

birth of my daughter. The reason that my OGBYN",71.439,6.451,77.88999999999999,
"was able to diagnose me was because she did
part of her residency in the endocrine clinic",77.89,5.28,83.17,
"at Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee, and with
that she saw a number of other acromegaly",83.17,7.01,90.18,
"patients, so she was able to spot, the
symptoms. Without that I don't think that",90.18,5.54,95.72000000000001,

After I was diagnosed, I met with a team,",95.72,5.13,100.85,
"a neurosurgeon and an endocrinologist, and
they decided that it was best that I receive",100.85,4.47,105.32,

The results of having residual tumor in my",105.32,5.79,111.11,

five years, it took that long for me to get,",122.92,6.679,129.599,
"relief from my symptoms of fatigue and
joint pain, sweating being able to get",129.599,8.381,137.98,
"back to a normal life again. A typical day
was pretty rough from the time that I woke",137.98,5.28,143.26,
"up if I even slept. It was very difficult
for me to take care of my newborn child. Waking",143.26,7.91,151.17,

she wanted to come with me. She was unbelievably",189.33,6.61,195.94000000000003,happy

and took notes. Took better notes than",195.94,5.39,201.32999999999998,

was when she looked at me and just said, ""I",201.33,8.299,209.62900000000002,
"can't believe that this is what you guys deal
with every day."" It was like somebody",209.629,5.19,214.819,fear

After surgery and radiation, I started on",214.819,7.711,222.53,
