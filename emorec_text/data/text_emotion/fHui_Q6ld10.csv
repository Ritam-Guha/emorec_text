Ellie: it's difficult to describe acromegaly to people. It's extremely hard. You can give
them resources and show them the definitions, but unless you're experiencing it, there
really is no way to describe it to people. My name is Ellie Kolosovsky and I was diagnosed
in 2010 with acromegaly. My first symptoms with acromegaly were a change in ring size
and feet size after the birth of my daughter.",0.0,48.24999999999999,48.24999999999999,sad
"Before acromegaly, I was a very active individual.
It was landscaping during college, loved to be outdoors. I loved rock climbing. I loved,
any kind of outdoor activity with, you know, my husband. We just really liked adventure.
My OGBYN diagnosed me kind of as a fluke. She saw me at my yearly checkup after the
birth of my daughter. The reason that my OGBYN was able to diagnose me was because she did
part of her residency in the endocrine clinic",48.25,34.92,83.17,sad
"at Froedtert Hospital in Milwaukee, and with
that she saw a number of other acromegaly patients, so she was able to spot, the
symptoms. Without that I don't think that I would have been diagnosed.
After I was diagnosed, I met with a team, a neurosurgeon and an endocrinologist, and
they decided that it was best that I receive surgery first to debulk most of my tumor.
The results of having residual tumor in my",83.17,27.939999999999998,111.11,sad
"brain is that now I need to follow up with
radiation and medication in order to continue to treat the IGF1 levels that are still
in my blood stream. Despite being on my medication for, four to
five years, it took that long for me to get, relief from my symptoms of fatigue and
joint pain, sweating being able to get back to a normal life again. A typical day
was pretty rough from the time that I woke",111.11,32.15,143.26,sad
"up if I even slept. It was very difficult
for me to take care of my newborn child. Waking up and putting my feet on the floor the
pain in my feet was so severe that sometimes I would fall over if I would forget to brace
myself when I would get out of bed. I'm extremely lucky to have the family support
that I have. A support system is so vital with this disease. I decided to go to the
last acromegaly conference kind of on a whim.",143.26,35.13,178.39,sad
"I'm part of the acromegaly community on Facebook
and I had seen that this conference was coming up. And I have a very good friend that has
kind of been with me through thick and thin, and she jumped right onboard and decided that
she wanted to come with me. She was unbelievably supportive the entire time that she was there,
and took notes. Took better notes than I did. And one of the most incredible things
was when she looked at me and just said, ""I",178.39,31.239,209.629,sad
"can't believe that this is what you guys deal
with every day."" It was like somebody finally got it.
After surgery and radiation, I started on my monthly injection. After that did not work,
then we went to daily injections as well as the monthly injection, and then I had the
birth of my son, so we kind of, we stopped the injections, and after he was born, we
went back up to the maximum dose of both injections.",209.629,29.321,238.95,sad
"In a regular treatment month I receive my
injection, and about three weeks into my injection I have some pretty severe wear-off effects.
I can immediately feel, you know, hip pain and joint pain, and my headaches get pretty
severe. It's regular almost to the, to the day of three weeks into my injections that
I start feeling that wear-off effect. Three months ago I started finally feeling
a lot better, able to physically do a lot",238.95,35.39,274.34,sad
"of the things that I was able to do before:
exercise, I lost a lot of weight, started looking like myself again. My husband and
I booked a trip to Colorado and looking into our trip, I was starting to plan things that
I never would have imagined planning in the last five years.
And we got out on the trail and of course my husband, who's super adventurous is feeling
ambitious, and he's like, ""Come on, let's",274.34,24.919000000000004,299.25899999999996,sad
"do it."" And I never would have done that before.
There's no way. It's the- absolutely the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, but I'm so
proud that I did it, and I can I can say that I conquered it.",299.259,13.581,312.84000000000003,sad
