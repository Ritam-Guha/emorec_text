hey so today we're going to talk about,0.03,3.84,3.8699999999999997,fear
intermittent fasting and diabetes is it,1.53,5.099,6.6290000000000004,fear
safe is it dangerous should you do it,3.87,6.059,9.929,fear
well if you actually pull up on Google,6.629,5.751,12.379999999999999,fear
data on this you're going to see that,9.929,5.58,15.509,fear
certain articles and videos will say,12.38,5.409,17.789,
it's not good to do this there's other,15.509,4.44,19.949,
diets that are better because they're,17.789,3.601,21.39,
trying to avoid something called,19.949,4.561,24.51,
hypoglycemia this really dangerous side,21.39,6.299,27.689,
effect but let's just take a look at the,24.51,5.16,29.67,
whole picture okay first of all what is,27.689,2.611,30.3,
diabetes,29.67,4.319,33.989000000000004,
it's hyperglycemia it's high sugar okay,30.3,6.96,37.26,
hypoglycemia is low blood sugar the,33.989,5.401,39.39,
purpose of the medication that a,37.26,5.22,42.48,
diabetic takes is to lower blood sugars,39.39,6.3,45.69,
and as one complication of this,42.48,5.16,47.64,
sometimes the medication can drive the,45.69,4.02,49.709999999999994,
blood sugars to low and you end up with,47.64,3.93,51.57,
hypoglycemia and so they give you these,49.71,3.84,53.55,
little sugar pill especially if you're a,51.57,6.149,57.719,
type 1 diabetic now when you do,53.55,6.3,59.849999999999994,
intermittent fasting you basically,57.719,4.89,62.609,
decrease the need for insulin okay you,59.85,5.91,65.76,
decrease the need for medication for,62.609,5.251,67.86,
diabetics now if you actually continue,65.76,5.31,71.07000000000001,
to take the same medication okay and do,67.86,5.79,73.65,
in a minute fasting at the same time you,71.07,3.96,75.02999999999999,
are going to have problems because it's,73.65,2.64,76.29,
going to drive your blood Sugar's too,75.03,6.18,81.21000000000001,
low but the goal I would think which,76.29,7.32,83.61000000000001,
makes total logical sense is to be able,81.21,5.76,86.97,
to decrease the need for medication,83.61,5.61,89.22,
right without make sense decrease the,86.97,6.149,93.119,fear
need for metformin for insulin and other,89.22,5.67,94.89,fear
diabetic medications that would be a,93.119,3.93,97.049,surprise
good thing because even insulin has side,94.89,4.26,99.15,surprise
effects when you take too much insulin,97.049,4.14,101.18900000000001,happy
and by the way the insulin that a,99.15,5.19,104.34,
diabetic is taking is not the same as,101.189,5.401,106.58999999999999,
your body is supposed to produce it's a,104.34,4.4,108.74000000000001,
genetically modified version of your own,106.59,4.26,110.85000000000001,
insulin and that's a whole other topic,108.74,4.12,112.86,
but the point is that there are side,110.85,4.799,115.649,
effects from taking too much insulin,112.86,5.219,118.079,
okay even if it's regulating your blood,115.649,5.01,120.659,
sugars I mean look it up yourself I'll,118.079,4.381,122.46,
put a link down below so you you can see,120.659,3.901,124.56,
this but when a diabetic type one for,122.46,2.6,125.05999999999999,
example,124.56,3.559,128.119,
consumes a large carbohydrate meal,125.06,5.71,130.77,
they're gonna need more insulin to deal,128.119,4.061,132.18,
with that excessive car,130.77,3.719,134.489,
right but they don't consume as many,132.18,4.52,136.70000000000002,
carbs they're gonna need less insulin,134.489,4.711,139.20000000000002,
when you do in a minute fasting the,136.7,4.899,141.599,
Nitra insulin goes down now the question,139.2,3.33,142.53,
is it dangerous,141.599,3.12,144.719,
well it's only dangerous if number one,142.53,4.95,147.48,
you don't do it gradually and you don't,144.719,4.711,149.43,
adjust your medication you don't get,147.48,3.929,151.409,
help from your doctor to make those,149.43,4.199,153.62900000000002,
adjustments with the quantity of,151.409,4.321,155.73,
medication so when you're doing in a,153.629,3.48,157.10899999999998,
minute fasting and you're eating less,155.73,3.81,159.54,
carbs the need for this medication goes,157.109,5.041,162.15,
down make the adjustments you'll have,159.54,4.83,164.37,
you won't get hypoglycemia now your,162.15,4.259,166.409,
blood Sugar's will come down but you're,164.37,3.36,167.73000000000002,fear
not going to feel bad because you're,166.409,2.881,169.29,fear
gonna actually your body's gonna be,167.73,5.039,172.76899999999998,fear
running on ketones and fat fuel and less,169.29,5.25,174.54,
blood sugars so even if your blood,172.769,4.2,176.969,
sugars are let's say for example 70 or,174.54,4.83,179.37,
even 60 and you're feeling fine,176.969,4.02,180.989,
so you really have to look at the whole,179.37,3.209,182.579,
picture and understand what's happening,180.989,3.991,184.98000000000002,
and not just kind of think with high,182.579,4.38,186.959,
blood sugar and low blood sugar so in,184.98,4.08,189.06,
reality intermittent fasting is not only,186.959,4.291,191.25,
an essential part of healing the,189.06,5.129,194.189,
pancreas but giving you the potential to,191.25,5.699,196.949,
come off your medications of course with,194.189,5.101,199.29,
the help of your doctor all right I'll,196.949,4.931,201.88000000000002,
see in the next video,199.29,5.05,204.34,
so I want to thank you for being here,201.88,4.35,206.23,
and watching my videos if you haven't,204.34,4.41,208.75,fear
already subscribed go ahead and do so so,206.23,6.83,213.06,
