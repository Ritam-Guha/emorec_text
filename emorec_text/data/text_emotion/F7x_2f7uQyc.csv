hi this is dr. Mark Hyman welcome to my,3.41,4.63,8.04,surprise
weekly house call your chance to ask me,6.24,4.529,10.769,surprise
your questions and this week's question,8.04,4.35,12.389999999999999,surprise
is hey dr. Hyman I know you're not big,10.769,3.901,14.67,surprise
on sugar and you tell people to cut down,12.39,4.17,16.560000000000002,surprise
on sugar consumption but how about,14.67,3.449,18.119,surprise
artificial sweeteners are they okay to,16.56,3.57,20.13,happy
drink and eat and should I use those,18.119,5.79,23.909,happy
instead well sadly the answer is a big,20.13,6.989,27.119,surprise
fat no and here's the reason there's,23.909,5.79,29.698999999999998,surprise
been mounds of research that artificial,27.119,4.56,31.679,surprise
sweeteners both in human studies animal,29.699,4.081,33.78,surprise
studies experimental studies population,31.679,4.831,36.51,happy
studies is bad news so let me share with,33.78,4.29,38.07,surprise
you what's going on first they've been,36.51,2.97,39.48,surprise
linked to obesity there's been a,38.07,3.57,41.64,surprise
dramatic increase in obesity with the,39.48,3.78,43.26,surprise
use of artificial sweeteners one study,41.64,4.289,45.929,surprise
of 400 people found that their belly,43.26,5.579,48.839,surprise
size no the middle increased by five,45.929,5.88,51.809000000000005,surprise
times for those who drink two diet sodas,48.839,5.61,54.449,fear
a day it also increases the risk of,51.809,6.061,57.87,surprise
obesity and weight gain dramatically and,54.449,4.921,59.37,surprise
even increase the risk of diabetes one,57.87,4.23,62.099999999999994,surprise
"large study of 66,000 women in Europe",59.37,5.4,64.77,happy
found that those who had won the tie so,62.1,5.31,67.41,happy
today increased their risk by 33 percent,64.77,5.13,69.89999999999999,happy
and if you add to your risk went up of,67.41,6.09,73.5,happy
66 percent to get diabetes that's very,69.9,6.93,76.83000000000001,happy
significant so number one it makes you,73.5,6.39,79.89,surprise
fat number two it does it by rewiring,76.83,5.64,82.47,surprise
and screwing up your brain chemistry and,79.89,4.95,84.84,surprise
your metabolism so what happens when you,82.47,3.51,85.98,happy
have an artificial sweetener,84.84,3.09,87.93,fear
well they stimulate your taste buds and,85.98,3.36,89.34,surprise
there are thousand times sweeter than,87.93,3.54,91.47000000000001,surprise
regular sugar and they promote this,89.34,5.4,94.74000000000001,surprise
response in the body that confuses it it,91.47,5.13,96.6,surprise
makes it think sugars on the way but,94.74,3.78,98.52,surprise
it's not really coming and what's going,96.6,4.08,100.67999999999999,surprise
on and a whole series of things happen,98.52,4.62,103.14,surprise
they're really bad one it slows your,100.68,5.46,106.14,surprise
metabolism down so you literally slow,103.14,4.26,107.4,surprise
your metabolism slow your body,106.14,2.28,108.42,surprise
temperature they've done this in,107.4,3.69,111.09,surprise
experiments and rats too you get super,108.42,5.13,113.55,surprise
hungry so humans and animals fed,111.09,4.65,115.74000000000001,surprise
artificial sweeteners eat way more food,113.55,4.38,117.92999999999999,fear
and way more sugar and way more carbs,115.74,3.99,119.72999999999999,surprise
just because they're over stimulated by,117.93,3.87,121.80000000000001,surprise
the sugar and it makes them hungry and,119.73,4.95,124.68,surprise
three it actually makes them gain weight,121.8,6.36,128.16,surprise
in some studies the rats put on 14% more,124.68,6.69,131.37,surprise
body fat than the rats eating regular,128.16,5.85,134.01,happy
sugar even though the people who,131.37,4.289,135.659,happy
the rats aiding Regan on people the rats,134.01,5.49,139.5,surprise
eating regular sugar had more food and,135.659,5.761,141.42,surprise
more calories that's really crazy right,139.5,4.26,143.76,surprise
so it slows metabolism and slows your,141.42,4.5,145.92,happy
body temperature it makes you hungry and,143.76,4.199,147.959,happy
it causes you to store body fat that's,145.92,6.539,152.45899999999997,surprise
bad news so things like aspartame and,147.959,8.221,156.18,surprise
NutraSweet and Splenda a sucralose and,152.459,6.571,159.03,surprise
and all the sugar alcohols and the,156.18,5.339,161.519,surprise
stevia's and the natural sweeteners all,159.03,3.87,162.9,surprise
of them are kind of the same stevia,161.519,2.58,164.09900000000002,surprise
might be a little bit better and a,162.9,3.479,166.37900000000002,fear
little bit of it I'm okay with but it's,164.099,4.591,168.69,fear
not like it's always unlimited and I,166.379,3.42,169.79899999999998,fear
really encourage people to think about,168.69,3.18,171.87,fear
the problem and the third thing that's,169.799,4.321,174.12,surprise
really scary is that artificial,171.87,5.88,177.75,surprise
sweeteners are highly addictive in one,174.12,5.22,179.34,surprise
study they did of rats they gave them,177.75,4.62,182.37,surprise
cocaine and that was IB cocaine or they,179.34,4.35,183.69,surprise
gave them artificial sweeteners and they,182.37,3.089,185.459,surprise
could pick which other one and they,183.69,3.96,187.65,surprise
always went for the artificial sugar,185.459,4.261,189.72,fear
they always went for in fact they work,187.65,4.559,192.209,happy
eight times harder to get the artificial,189.72,3.87,193.59,happy
sweeteners than they did the cocaine and,192.209,2.791,195.0,happy
if they were already addicted to cocaine,193.59,3.239,196.829,happy
guess what they went for the artificial,195.0,4.2,199.2,fear
sweeteners so it completely screws up,196.829,4.081,200.91,happy
your capacity to regulate your food,199.2,3.81,203.01,surprise
intake makes you hungry addicted and,200.91,5.189,206.099,surprise
it's bad news so there's no reason to,203.01,4.92,207.92999999999998,surprise
consume artificial sweeteners at all if,206.099,3.51,209.60899999999998,surprise
you like sugar and you want to have a,207.93,4.709,212.639,surprise
little bit fine great put a teaspoon of,209.609,5.071,214.68,surprise
sugar in your coffee I mean you wouldn't,212.639,4.561,217.20000000000002,surprise
have a soda which has 15 teaspoons of,214.68,4.5,219.18,surprise
sugar and you wouldn't put 15 teaspoons,217.2,4.11,221.31,fear
of sugar in your coffee so you know eat,219.18,5.52,224.70000000000002,surprise
real food have sweet things but don't,221.31,5.16,226.47,surprise
have pharmacologic dose of sugar the,224.7,3.539,228.23899999999998,happy
problem isn't a little bit of sugar we,226.47,3.389,229.859,happy
put our coffee or a little bit of,228.239,3.12,231.359,surprise
dessert we have that's not the problem,229.859,3.71,233.56900000000002,surprise
it's the sugar that's added to our food,231.359,4.591,235.95000000000002,surprise
80% of processed foods have added sugar,233.569,4.6,238.16899999999998,surprise
including things like ketchup and salad,235.95,4.17,240.11999999999998,surprise
dressing and tomato sauce I mean your,238.169,5.371,243.54000000000002,surprise
prego tomato sauce has more sugar in a,240.12,5.67,245.79,surprise
serving of tomato sauce than two Oreo,243.54,5.279,248.819,surprise
cookies one Yoplait yogurt which is like,245.79,6.27,252.06,surprise
a breakfast yogurt has more sugar than a,248.819,6.121,254.94,surprise
can of coke it's frightening so it's not,252.06,5.1,257.16,surprise
breakfast it's dessert so you really,254.94,3.69,258.63,surprise
don't want to have processed foods with,257.16,2.759,259.91900000000004,surprise

food had sugar to your food but it's not,263.61,3.96,267.57,surprise
the sugar that,266.55,2.37,268.92,surprise
you had that's a problem it's a sugar,267.57,3.36,270.93,surprise
