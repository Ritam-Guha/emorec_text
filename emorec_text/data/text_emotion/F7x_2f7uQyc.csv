hi this is dr. Mark Hyman welcome to my weekly house call your chance to ask me your questions and this week's question is hey dr. Hyman I know you're not big on sugar and you tell people to cut down,3.41,21.58,24.99,angry
on sugar consumption but how about artificial sweeteners are they okay to drink and eat and should I use those instead well sadly the answer is a big fat no and here's the reason there's,14.67,25.588,40.258,angry
been mounds of research that artificial sweeteners both in human studies animal studies experimental studies population studies is bad news so let me share with you what's going on first they've been,27.119,20.732,47.851,angry
linked to obesity there's been a dramatic increase in obesity with the use of artificial sweeteners one study of 400 people found that their belly size no the middle increased by five,38.07,23.098,61.168,angry
"times for those who drink two diet sodas a day it also increases the risk of obesity and weight gain dramatically and even increase the risk of diabetes one large study of 66,000 women in Europe",48.839,26.222,75.061,angry
found that those who had won the tie so today increased their risk by 33 percent and if you add to your risk went up of 66 percent to get diabetes that's very significant so number one it makes you,62.1,29.85,91.95,angry
fat number two it does it by rewiring and screwing up your brain chemistry and your metabolism so what happens when you have an artificial sweetener well they stimulate your taste buds and,76.83,20.549999999999997,97.38,angry
there are thousand times sweeter than regular sugar and they promote this response in the body that confuses it it makes it think sugars on the way but it's not really coming and what's going,87.93,21.93,109.86000000000001,angry
on and a whole series of things happen they're really bad one it slows your metabolism down so you literally slow your metabolism slow your body temperature they've done this in,98.52,20.310000000000002,118.83,angry
experiments and rats too you get super hungry so humans and animals fed artificial sweeteners eat way more food and way more sugar and way more carbs just because they're over stimulated by,108.42,22.02,130.44,sad
the sugar and it makes them hungry and three it actually makes them gain weight in some studies the rats put on 14% more body fat than the rats eating regular sugar even though the people who,119.73,28.139000000000003,147.869,angry
the rats aiding Regan on people the rats eating regular sugar had more food and more calories that's really crazy right so it slows metabolism and slows your body temperature it makes you hungry and,134.01,24.21,158.22,angry
it causes you to store body fat that's bad news so things like aspartame and NutraSweet and Splenda a sucralose and and all the sugar alcohols and the stevia's and the natural sweeteners all,145.92,30.540000000000003,176.45999999999998,angry
of them are kind of the same stevia might be a little bit better and a little bit of it I'm okay with but it's not like it's always unlimited and I really encourage people to think about,161.519,17.25,178.769,sad
the problem and the third thing that's really scary is that artificial sweeteners are highly addictive in one study they did of rats they gave them cocaine and that was IB cocaine or they,169.799,24.391,194.19,angry
gave them artificial sweeteners and they could pick which other one and they always went for the artificial sugar they always went for in fact they work eight times harder to get the artificial,182.37,19.739,202.109,angry
sweeteners than they did the cocaine and if they were already addicted to cocaine guess what they went for the artificial sweeteners so it completely screws up your capacity to regulate your food,192.209,18.121,210.33,angry
intake makes you hungry addicted and it's bad news so there's no reason to consume artificial sweeteners at all if you like sugar and you want to have a little bit fine great put a teaspoon of,200.91,23.399,224.309,angry
sugar in your coffee I mean you wouldn't have a soda which has 15 teaspoons of sugar and you wouldn't put 15 teaspoons of sugar in your coffee so you know eat real food have sweet things but don't,212.639,23.851,236.49,sad
have pharmacologic dose of sugar the problem isn't a little bit of sugar we put our coffee or a little bit of dessert we have that's not the problem it's the sugar that's added to our food,224.7,18.349,243.04899999999998,angry
80% of processed foods have added sugar including things like ketchup and salad dressing and tomato sauce I mean your prego tomato sauce has more sugar in a serving of tomato sauce than two Oreo,233.569,25.09,258.659,angry
cookies one Yoplait yogurt which is like a breakfast yogurt has more sugar than a can of coke it's frightening so it's not breakfast it's dessert so you really don't want to have processed foods with,245.79,23.94,269.73,sad
added sugar you want to have real food so you want every Oh food don't eat artificial sweeteners with it eat real food had sugar to your food but it's not the sugar that,258.63,17.941000000000003,276.571,NA
you had that's a problem it's a sugar that's added that's the key not the hundred and fifty two pounds of sugar that's added to our diet every day I mean every year by the by the food,267.57,17.759999999999998,285.33,NA
industry it's just what you add that's okay so think if sugar is a recreational drug right it's something you would enjoy from time to time it's like you have a glass of wine or a glass of,276.33,18.0,294.33,NA
tequila but you wouldn't have tequila for breakfast lunch and dinner or wine from well some people do but he wouldn't have wine for breakfast lunch and dinner you and use it as a recreational,284.85,17.79,302.64000000000004,NA
substance that you know it's powerful you know it's strong and you have it in limited amounts same for sugar so if you want to stay healthy if you want to lose weight if you want to avoid diabetes if,294.36,18.779999999999998,313.14,NA
you want to reduce your food intake overall eat real sugar in moderation like a recreational drug and stay away from artificial sweeteners completely now if you want to have a little stevia,303.54,24.059999999999995,327.6,NA
