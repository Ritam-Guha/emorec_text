[Music] um i've had i i can tell you've had multiple patients who had changes in their jaw their bite,1.91,19.529,21.439,angry
uh even the spacing between their teeth uh temporal mandibular joint problems that had been seeing um you know specialists in dentistry in order to fix those problems,10.96,22.481,33.441,angry
for example thinking that maybe their growth hormone headaches were actually coming because of jaw pain and temporomandibular joint problems i at one point had a patient,22.56,22.959,45.519,angry
whose uh dentist had proposed pulling all of his teeth out for false teeth to alleviate his symptoms and about two weeks after that proposed,33.44,20.48,53.92,angry
uh procedure which the patient had come to the um pituitary center for an analysis or an assessment,44.879,16.961000000000002,61.84,angry
and he was diagnosed with with the growth hormone tumor which was removed and when it was removed those symptoms were alleviated so you know adults,52.96,19.598000000000003,72.558,angry
we our teeth shouldn't change that much our jaw our shape of our face the jaw changes shouldn't happen as an adult so when those are happening you know the dentist,62.399,20.642,83.041,angry
really provides that continuity people do go in every six months or every year they're getting you know x-rays of their of their bone structure and their teeth and i think,72.96,21.52,94.47999999999999,angry
we should figure out a way as you point out to educate our colleagues in dentistry about they could be the first line seeing these changes um in the jaw and,83.36,20.799,104.15899999999999,angry
the teeth we did have a meeting a few years ago and discussed how we could do outreach to the american dental association do you do that at an annual,94.4,18.399,112.799,angry
meeting do you put together a pamphlet that you send out to dentists that they you know as a as an educational tool in their office,103.759,20.562,124.321,angry
but i think you make a really valid point that we as endocrinologists talk all the time about how how could this be missed and yet,113.6,19.04,132.64,NA
have we done a good enough job in educating our colleagues because it is rare but we see it more frequently than they do,123.6,23.200000000000003,146.8,NA
