"Did you know that gas, diarrhea and stomach pain 
is the most common side effect of Metformin? It s   the absolute most common reason that my patients 
end up dumping this medication in the garbage,   but it doesn t have to be that way for most. 
Just by taking a few steps like when you take it,   what you take it with and even what 
type of metformin you have can can   make a big difference in being able 
to take this important medication.

"Hi, I m Dr. Erik Richardson a board certified 
Family Practice physician. I d like to welcome   you to FamilyMed, a channel that focuses 
giving you practical and accurate medical   information to help you and your family. In today 
s video we are going to go over 4 simple steps   that can help you tolerate taking this important 
medication. If you are looking for a more in-depth   discussion of metformin you can check out 
my other video on metformin right here.  
  ",28.64,21.28,49.92,sad
"Abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea and bloating 
are still the most common effect that we see   with this medication. But there are 4 things 
that you can do to decrease this chance.  
   First is take it with food, Metformin 
can have a possibility of affecting the   stomach and gut lining and taking it on 
an empty stomach can increase that risk.   It s a medication that is 
usually given once or twice a day  ",50.48,20.4,70.88,angry
"so taking it with meals has been shown to improve 
your chances of avoiding those side effects.   This is especially true while just starting on 
it. As your body gets used to it, it doesn t seem   to be as important but if you at least start out 
taking it with food you will likely do better. 
   Second is ask your doctor if the extended release 
tablets would be appropriate for you. It comes in   both an immediate release and an extended 
release version. The good news is the 500mg  ",75.44,24.880000000000003,100.32,sad
"tablets are generic and cheap so it can be a 
great option. WE tend to see that those who take   the extended release version, tend to do better 
in avoiding the significant stomach symptoms.   Just a word of warning though, don t ask for the 
1000mg Extended release metformin because they are   super expensive. The 500mg you can get for around 
5-10 dollars a month while the 1000mg dose is   upwards of a $1000 a month. It s totally insane, 
and I don t get it, so just be warned.    
  ",106.0,25.520000000000003,131.52,angry
"The third is to start the dose 
low and slowly increase it.   The most common effective dose for 
many patients is 1000mg twice a day.   If you need to be up at the higher doses to get 
your sugars under control then start at a lower   dose like 500mg take that for several days up to 
a week or more before increasing to the next dose.   Keep doing that week by week until you get to 
the full dose. If you start right away at the  ",136.48,22.4,158.88,angry
"high dose you are more likely to spend your day 
in the bathroom than doing the things that you   want to do. Remember, start low and increase it 
slowly. Of course, always talk to your doctor   and pharmacist about how they recommend you take 
it, but ask them about this and see how you do.  
   The 4th step is watch your diet. One of the ways 
that metformin works is by decreasing how much   sugar is absorbed through your intestines. That 
s a good thing in trying to keep your sugars down  ",160.4,23.44,183.84,angry
"but can make a real mess when it comes to your 
bowels. One of the things that helps us digest   is the bacteria that resides in our intestines. 
All that extra sugar for the bacteria is like a   group of kids in a play gym after Halloween. 
It s not a pretty sight. The bacteria start   to ferment the sugars and create gas and all 
the other fun things that come with it. So,   avoiding foods that have sugar or a lot of refined 
carbohydrates can make a huge difference in being  ",187.92,23.84,211.76,NA
"able to tolerate the medication. Now if that diet 
sounds familiar, it s how you should be eating   as a diabetic anyway, so get to eating right and 
see how much it helps.
Metformin is an important   medication that works well to treat diabetes 
when diet and exercise are not enough but the   fact of the matter is that not everybody is going 
to tolerate it. These steps will give you the best   chance of being able to do well with it but even 
then sometimes it s not going to work. If you find  ",211.76,24.720000000000002,236.48,angry

follow along with us.
On today s episode we are   going to be talking about one of the most common 
medications that we use to treat diabetes called   metformin. This is a medication that has been 
available in the United States since 1995. It   s main use is to help control blood sugars in 
diabetes but it is also used in conditions such   as polycystic ovarian syndrome and some use it 
to help with weight loss.  
Metformin belongs  ",281.196,0.473,281.66900000000004,NA
"to the class of medications called Biguanides. It 
works a little different than any other diabetic   medications. There are several different effects 
it has on the body that help control blood sugar.   The first is that it works on decreasing how 
much sugar your liver releases into the blood.   Now Maybe you didn t know this but the liver 
is actually one of the biggest storage organs   for sugar in the body. When you need a boost of 
energy the liver releases glucose to give you  ",281.669,0.475,282.144,NA
"that little extra boost that you need. Normally 
this works well. In diabetes though, it can be   a problem. You don t want to have that extra sugar 
released, so metformin helps slow that down. Also,   it Decreases how much sugar is absorbed from the 
intestines and helps to work on improving your   bodies sensitivity to insulin. That s one of the 
big problems in conditions like diabetes or PCOS.   In these conditions, your body is resistant to the 
hormone that helps bring the sugar from the blood  ",282.144,0.493,282.637,NA
"into the cells in order to be utilized. So that 
s why metformin is such a great choice for most   people with these conditions. It does a great 
job in trying to decrease that resistence and   counteract the effects that this causes.  
So at 
this point you may have asked why you should even   care that your blood sugars are elevated? This is 
a great question and unfortunately one that I have   to talk about a lot. Diabetes is extremely common 
and getting more and more so as time goes on.  ",282.637,0.484,283.121,NA
"Untreated diabetes has some awful complications 
that can happen including dramatically increasing   your risk for heart attacks and strokes. It can 
affect your eyes putting you at risk for going   blind, it can affect your kidneys causing them to 
fail as well as affect your nerves and circulation   in your legs and feet especially causing damage to 
the nerves. This is a big deal because it makes it   easier to get injured and then it doesn t heal 
well putting you at risk for infections even  ",283.121,0.488,283.609,NA
"leading sometimes to amputations. So, diabetes is 
not a good thing and not treating it is obviously   not a good thing. So if you are taking this 
for diabetes that s the reason you need to be   motivated to control and treat this as best as you 
can.
Now, certainly medication is not the only way   you should treat diabetes. Diet and lifestyle 
changes are the absolutely most essential thing   to be working on to control this and keep it from 
getting worse. But unfortunately for many, diet  ",283.609,0.484,284.09299999999996,NA
"and lifestyle changes are not enough or we can t 
make them fast enough in order to get your sugars   under control. That s likely why your doctor 
is recommending that you take the metformin.   So what should you expect from this medication?
 
Well, first of all it comes in both a tablet and   liquid form. Tablets come in either an immediate 
release or an extended release version of 500,   850 or 1000mg. Depending on which formulation 
you have you can take it either once or twice  ",284.093,0.474,284.567,NA
"a day. An important thing to remember about this 
medication specifically, and diabetes medications   in general, is that it only works while you are 
taking it. I have people come in all the time   with their blood sugars high after we originally 
had it controlled telling me that they stopped   the medicine because we fixed it. Unfortunately, 
this isn t the way it works. Unless you have some   underlying lifestyle issues that are causing your 
blood sugars to be high and you fix those, you  ",284.567,0.485,285.052,NA
"need to stay on these medications. Don t stop them 
unless you discuss it with your doctor. 
Metformin   is typically the first medication that we start 
people on when they are diagnosed with diabetes.   Overall for most people its tolerated quite well 
but there are some issues that people can have   with taking the medication that we need to talk 
about.
The most common side effects that we tend   to see with metformin are some sort of stomach 
type symptoms. This can be nausea, bloating, gas,  ",285.052,0.489,285.541,NA
"diarrhea or all of the above. This can be anywhere 
from mild to more severe symptoms. There are ways   that we try to avoid this though so don t despair. 
If you are patient as you start this medication,   we can usually get you to the appropriate dose 
without having to live with the side effects.   One of the tricks that we use is starting the 
medication at a low dose and increasing it slowly.   For example we will start somebody at 500mg 
once a day and then increase their dose every  ",285.541,0.481,286.022,NA
"few days to a week until they are the goal dose. 
This usually does the trick. Taking the higher   doses too quickly is usually the reason people 
start to have side effects. We have also noticed   that taking it with meals or in the evening at 
first can also make a difference. And finally,   I ve found that for a lot of people, putting them 
on the extended release version tends to help them   avoid these side effects. 
The other thing that 
you can do to minimize these side effects is be  ",286.022,0.483,286.505,NA
"more careful with your diet. If you remember, one 
of the ways this medication works, is by blocking   how much sugar is absorbed from the gut. When 
less sugar is absorbed, more stays in the gut   and the bacteria in your gut start to digest 
that sugar causing it to ferment. Well, that   causes gas and all the other pleasant side effects 
that come with it. So, as a diabetic, you need to   be watching your sugar or carb intake anyway 
so this can add a little more motivation to do  ",286.505,0.475,286.98,NA
"so.  
Unfortunately some people just aren t able 
to tolerate it and we have to reach for something   else to treat. But for the majority, if we just 
increase the dose slow and watch our diet better,   we can avoid this main side effect.
So besides the 
nausea, gas and diarrhea, other side effects that   we can see are some decreased appetite, feeling of 
weakness, headaches, sometimes a metallic taste in   the mouth and a rash. These last side effects I 
don t see as much. Usually if somebody doesn t  ",286.98,0.495,287.475,NA
"want to take the medication its because of the 
stomach symptoms.  
 There are more some more   serious albeit rare reactions that you should be 
aware of and watch for. The most concerning of   which is a condition called Lactic Acidosis. This 
is when the pH or acid level drops in your blood   and can make you very sick and even be fatal. This 
is very uncommon but can happen when your kidney   s are not functioning well. We watch for this in 
those who have chronic kidney disease, in those  ",287.475,0.485,287.96000000000004,NA
"who are really sick and dehydrated as well as some 
people undergoing certain medical procedures where   they are giving IV contrast. Your doctor should be 
keeping an eye on your kidney function overtime so   its not something that we see much. I will also 
recommend to my patients that if they are sick   and vomiting and not taking in fluids that they 
avoid taking their metformin during these times.   It would be a good conversation to have with your 
doctor to see how they would want you to handle  ",287.96,0.494,288.454,NA
"it.  
One other thing that you should keep an 
eye on. More recently we ve seen that metformin   can possibly affect your Vitamin B12 absorption, 
which if unrecognized might contribute to certain   anemias or something well call neuropathy-this 
is where the nerves are damaged and can cause   some chronic pain issues. This can easily be 
checked in your routine blood work.
