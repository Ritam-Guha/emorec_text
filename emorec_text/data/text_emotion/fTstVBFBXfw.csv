that you can do to decrease this chance.  
  ",54.64,4.08,58.72,sad

can have a possibility of affecting the  ",63.28,4.32,67.6,sad

an empty stomach can increase that risk.  ",67.6,4.48,72.08,fear

usually given once or twice a day  ",72.08,3.36,75.44,fear

your chances of avoiding those side effects.  ",75.44,4.4,79.84,happy
"This is especially true while just starting on 
it. As your body gets used to it, it doesn t seem  ",80.4,4.64,85.04,fear

taking it with food you will likely do better. 
  ",85.04,5.28,90.32000000000001,sad
"Second is ask your doctor if the extended release 
tablets would be appropriate for you. It comes in  ",94.88,5.44,100.32,fear

release version. The good news is the 500mg  ",100.32,5.12,105.44,sad

low and slowly increase it.  ",136.48,3.68,140.16,fear

many patients is 1000mg twice a day.  ",140.16,4.0,144.16,fear

a week or more before increasing to the next dose.  ",149.28,5.6,154.88,surprise

the full dose. If you start right away at the  ",155.68,4.72,160.4,fear
"high dose you are more likely to spend your day 
in the bathroom than doing the things that you  ",160.4,4.0,164.4,fear

slowly. Of course, always talk to your doctor  ",164.4,5.76,170.16,fear

it, but ask them about this and see how you do.  
  ",170.16,4.4,174.56,fear

that metformin works is by decreasing how much  ",178.64,4.96,183.6,fear

s a good thing in trying to keep your sugars down  ",183.6,4.32,187.92,happy

"going to be talking about one of the most common 
medications that we use to treat diabetes called  ",281.292,0.098,281.39,NA
"metformin. This is a medication that has been 
available in the United States since 1995. It  ",281.39,0.092,281.48199999999997,NA

diabetes but it is also used in conditions such  ",281.482,0.094,281.576,NA
"as polycystic ovarian syndrome and some use it 
to help with weight loss.  
Metformin belongs  ",281.576,0.093,281.66900000000004,NA
"to the class of medications called Biguanides. It 
works a little different than any other diabetic  ",281.669,0.099,281.768,NA
"medications. There are several different effects 
it has on the body that help control blood sugar.  ",281.768,0.099,281.86699999999996,NA

much sugar your liver releases into the blood.  ",281.867,0.092,281.959,NA
"Now Maybe you didn t know this but the liver 
is actually one of the biggest storage organs  ",281.959,0.091,282.05,NA

energy the liver releases glucose to give you  ",282.05,0.094,282.144,NA

this works well. In diabetes though, it can be  ",282.144,0.095,282.23900000000003,NA
"a problem. You don t want to have that extra sugar 
released, so metformin helps slow that down. Also,  ",282.239,0.102,282.34099999999995,NA
"it Decreases how much sugar is absorbed from the 
intestines and helps to work on improving your  ",282.341,0.096,282.437,NA
"bodies sensitivity to insulin. That s one of the 
big problems in conditions like diabetes or PCOS.  ",282.437,0.099,282.536,NA
"In these conditions, your body is resistant to the 
hormone that helps bring the sugar from the blood  ",282.536,0.101,282.637,NA

"people with these conditions. It does a great 
job in trying to decrease that resistence and  ",282.733,0.092,282.825,NA

So at 
this point you may have asked why you should even  ",282.825,0.099,282.924,NA
"care that your blood sugars are elevated? This is 
a great question and unfortunately one that I have  ",282.924,0.101,283.025,NA

for diabetes that s the reason you need to be  ",283.709,0.09,283.799,NA

can.
Now, certainly medication is not the only way  ",283.799,0.102,283.90099999999995,NA

Well, first of all it comes in both a tablet and  ",284.282,0.097,284.37899999999996,NA

release or an extended release version of 500,  ",284.379,0.096,284.475,NA
"850 or 1000mg. Depending on which formulation 
you have you can take it either once or twice  ",284.475,0.092,284.567,NA
"a day. An important thing to remember about this 
medication specifically, and diabetes medications  ",284.567,0.099,284.666,NA
"in general, is that it only works while you are 
taking it. I have people come in all the time  ",284.666,0.094,284.76,NA
"with their blood sugars high after we originally 
had it controlled telling me that they stopped  ",284.76,0.096,284.856,NA

this isn t the way it works. Unless you have some  ",284.856,0.099,284.955,NA
"underlying lifestyle issues that are causing your 
blood sugars to be high and you fix those, you  ",284.955,0.097,285.05199999999996,NA
"need to stay on these medications. Don t stop them 
unless you discuss it with your doctor. 
Metformin  ",285.052,0.102,285.154,NA
"is typically the first medication that we start 
people on when they are diagnosed with diabetes.  ",285.154,0.097,285.251,NA
"Overall for most people its tolerated quite well 
but there are some issues that people can have  ",285.251,0.096,285.347,NA
"with taking the medication that we need to talk 
about.
The most common side effects that we tend  ",285.347,0.097,285.44399999999996,NA
"to see with metformin are some sort of stomach 
type symptoms. This can be nausea, bloating, gas,  ",285.444,0.097,285.541,NA
"diarrhea or all of the above. This can be anywhere 
from mild to more severe symptoms. There are ways  ",285.541,0.101,285.642,NA
"that we try to avoid this though so don t despair. 
If you are patient as you start this medication,  ",285.642,0.1,285.742,NA
"we can usually get you to the appropriate dose 
without having to live with the side effects.  ",285.742,0.093,285.83500000000004,NA
"One of the tricks that we use is starting the 
medication at a low dose and increasing it slowly.  ",285.835,0.097,285.93199999999996,NA
"For example we will start somebody at 500mg 
once a day and then increase their dose every  ",285.932,0.09,286.022,NA
"few days to a week until they are the goal dose. 
This usually does the trick. Taking the higher  ",286.022,0.096,286.118,NA
"doses too quickly is usually the reason people 
start to have side effects. We have also noticed  ",286.118,0.096,286.214,NA
"that taking it with meals or in the evening at 
first can also make a difference. And finally,  ",286.214,0.094,286.308,NA
"I ve found that for a lot of people, putting them 
on the extended release version tends to help them  ",286.308,0.101,286.409,NA
"avoid these side effects. 
The other thing that 
you can do to minimize these side effects is be  ",286.409,0.096,286.505,NA
"more careful with your diet. If you remember, one 
of the ways this medication works, is by blocking  ",286.505,0.1,286.605,NA
"how much sugar is absorbed from the gut. When 
less sugar is absorbed, more stays in the gut  ",286.605,0.092,286.697,NA
"and the bacteria in your gut start to digest 
that sugar causing it to ferment. Well, that  ",286.697,0.09,286.787,NA
"causes gas and all the other pleasant side effects 
that come with it. So, as a diabetic, you need to  ",286.787,0.101,286.888,NA
"be watching your sugar or carb intake anyway 
so this can add a little more motivation to do  ",286.888,0.092,286.97999999999996,NA
"so.  
Unfortunately some people just aren t able 
to tolerate it and we have to reach for something  ",286.98,0.099,287.079,NA
"else to treat. But for the majority, if we just 
increase the dose slow and watch our diet better,  ",287.079,0.098,287.177,NA
"we can avoid this main side effect.
So besides the 
nausea, gas and diarrhea, other side effects that  ",287.177,0.101,287.278,NA
"we can see are some decreased appetite, feeling of 
weakness, headaches, sometimes a metallic taste in  ",287.278,0.102,287.38,NA

don t see as much. Usually if somebody doesn t  ",287.38,0.095,287.475,NA

stomach symptoms.  
 There are more some more  ",287.475,0.093,287.56800000000004,NA
