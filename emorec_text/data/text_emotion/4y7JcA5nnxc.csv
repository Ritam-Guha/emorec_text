so I wanted to create a video on this,0.03,3.96,3.9899999999999998,sad
situation that can occur where you have,1.65,5.37,7.02,sad
slightly higher blood glucose but you're,3.99,6.06,10.05,NA
still in ketosis okay because normally,7.02,4.59,11.61,NA
the way it works is you have high sugar,10.05,4.589,14.639000000000001,NA
and low ketones haikyuu tones and low,11.61,5.37,16.98,NA
sugar but what happens sometimes is your,14.639,4.051,18.689999999999998,NA
blood glucose might go up but you're,16.98,4.379,21.359,NA
still in ketosis so why does that happen,18.69,3.78,22.470000000000002,NA
but before I tell you that let me just,21.359,2.781,24.14,NA
get into why you might have high sugar,22.47,3.719,26.189,NA
doing keto okay,24.14,4.35,28.490000000000002,NA
excessive protein for dinner tonight,26.189,5.701,31.89,NA
could create a spike in blood sugar the,28.49,5.74,34.23,NA
next day okay that's one thing so make,31.89,3.66,35.55,NA
sure you have a moderate amount of,34.23,4.5,38.73,NA
protein the two car back reap you start,35.55,6.24,41.79,NA
adding more carbs unknowingly and when,38.73,4.47,43.199999999999996,NA
you have to kind of look at them and,41.79,3.42,45.21,fear
reevaluate you're like wow I'm doing too,43.2,3.78,46.980000000000004,NA
many carbohydrates so that could be a,45.21,4.169,49.379,NA
situation and then frequent meal so,46.98,3.66,50.64,NA
you're doing too many snacks,49.379,5.221,54.599999999999994,NA
that'll do it or your cortisol is too,50.64,6.329,56.969,NA
high so when people go through stress,54.6,4.02,58.620000000000005,NA
okay they're gonna have higher levels of,56.969,3.93,60.899,NA
cortisol the peak time of cortisol,58.62,3.869,62.489,NA
happens about 8 o'clock in the morning,60.899,4.44,65.339,NA
so if you're actually checking your,62.489,5.431,67.92,NA
blood glucose in the morning at 8,65.339,4.35,69.689,NA
o'clock and find that it's pretty high,67.92,4.68,72.6,NA
it could be from the cortisol that is,69.689,4.561,74.25,NA
being spiked because your body's going,72.6,2.85,75.44999999999999,NA
through some stress or something but,74.25,3.479,77.729,NA
typically for everyone it'll be slightly,75.45,3.959,79.409,NA
higher it shouldn't be that much but it,77.729,3.271,81.0,NA
would be slightly higher nothing to,79.409,4.64,84.049,NA
worry about but just make note of that,81.0,5.28,86.28,NA
but here's what happens when you,84.049,4.871,88.92,NA
actually do a healthy keto plan and,86.28,4.35,90.63,NA
you're doing in a minute fasting you are,88.92,2.82,91.74,NA
lowering insulin,90.63,4.11,94.74,NA
now remember insulin suppresses blood,91.74,5.58,97.32,NA
sugars it pushes blood sugars down so,94.74,5.94,100.67999999999999,NA
now we don't have the quantity of,97.32,6.96,104.27999999999999,NA
insulin but we still may have insulin,100.68,6.18,106.86000000000001,NA
resistance because that takes a while to,104.28,7.229,111.509,NA
to correct in the body so if we have a,106.86,6.719,113.579,NA
lower amounts of insulin and insulin,111.509,5.61,117.119,NA
resistance your blood sugar might go up,113.579,6.631,120.21,NA
a little bit more okay but you're still,117.119,5.371,122.49,NA
being ketosis so you might still like,120.21,6.81,127.02,NA
show like 1.0 or 1.2 1.5 and your ketone,122.49,7.739,130.22899999999998,NA
levels and have blood sugars that are 90,127.02,4.77,131.79,NA
to 105,130.229,3.361,133.59,fear
that's totally normal,131.79,3.93,135.72,NA
it's just gonna take time for this to,133.59,4.619,138.209,NA
heal and then you'll see it'll come down,135.72,4.2,139.92,NA
it's basically all that means it's,138.209,3.481,141.69,NA
you're in a transition phase and there's,139.92,2.64,142.55999999999997,NA
nothing to worry about,141.69,2.159,143.849,NA
so as long as you're feeling good you,142.56,3.33,145.89000000000001,NA
have a lot of energy and everything is,143.849,3.541,147.39,NA
good I would not worry about it at all,145.89,3.12,149.01,NA
but I just wanted to point out this fact,147.39,5.129,152.51899999999998,NA
this can happen and it's because the,149.01,5.91,154.92,NA
insulin is going down but you still have,152.519,4.44,156.959,NA
insulin resistance which does take a bit,154.92,4.53,159.45,NA
to actually correct that all right,156.959,5.191,162.15,NA
