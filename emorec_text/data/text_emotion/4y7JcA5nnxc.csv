so I wanted to create a video on this situation that can occur where you have slightly higher blood glucose but you're still in ketosis okay because normally the way it works is you have high sugar,0.03,24.569000000000003,24.599000000000004,angry
and low ketones haikyuu tones and low sugar but what happens sometimes is your blood glucose might go up but you're still in ketosis so why does that happen but before I tell you that let me just,11.61,20.360999999999997,31.970999999999997,angry
get into why you might have high sugar doing keto okay excessive protein for dinner tonight could create a spike in blood sugar the next day okay that's one thing so make,22.47,23.169999999999998,45.64,NA
sure you have a moderate amount of protein the two car back reap you start adding more carbs unknowingly and when you have to kind of look at them and reevaluate you're like wow I'm doing too,34.23,22.410000000000004,56.64,NA
many carbohydrates so that could be a situation and then frequent meal so you're doing too many snacks that'll do it or your cortisol is too high so when people go through stress,45.21,23.399,68.60900000000001,NA
okay they're gonna have higher levels of cortisol the peak time of cortisol happens about 8 o'clock in the morning so if you're actually checking your blood glucose in the morning at 8,56.969,22.020000000000003,78.989,NA
o'clock and find that it's pretty high it could be from the cortisol that is being spiked because your body's going through some stress or something but typically for everyone it'll be slightly,67.92,19.529,87.449,NA
higher it shouldn't be that much but it would be slightly higher nothing to worry about but just make note of that but here's what happens when you actually do a healthy keto plan and,77.729,22.412,100.14099999999999,NA
you're doing in a minute fasting you are lowering insulin now remember insulin suppresses blood sugars it pushes blood sugars down so now we don't have the quantity of,88.92,25.41,114.33,NA
insulin but we still may have insulin resistance because that takes a while to to correct in the body so if we have a lower amounts of insulin and insulin resistance your blood sugar might go up,100.68,32.369,133.049,NA
a little bit more okay but you're still being ketosis so you might still like show like 1.0 or 1.2 1.5 and your ketone levels and have blood sugars that are 90 to 105,117.119,28.051000000000002,145.17000000000002,NA
that's totally normal it's just gonna take time for this to heal and then you'll see it'll come down it's basically all that means it's you're in a transition phase and there's,131.79,18.869999999999997,150.66,NA
nothing to worry about so as long as you're feeling good you have a lot of energy and everything is good I would not worry about it at all but I just wanted to point out this fact,141.69,17.278999999999996,158.969,NA
this can happen and it's because the insulin is going down but you still have insulin resistance which does take a bit to actually correct that all right thanks for watching so we've been,149.01,24.031000000000002,173.041,NA
