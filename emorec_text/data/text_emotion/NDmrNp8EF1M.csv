more at risk of getting now I know it's not exciting I know it's not fun but it is a really important topic and I'd rather you learn it here in the recovery room then in urgent care,11.519,20.462,31.981,angry
hi I'm cancer physical therapy specialist dr. Leslie walki welcome to the recovery room today we're talking cellulitis what it is why it can be such a big deal how you can minimize your,22.05,26.55,48.6,angry
risk of getting it and what to do if you do get it let's break it down cellulitis is a bacterial infection that occurs right underneath the skin it is most common in people who've had lymph nodes,34.98,32.339,67.31899999999999,angry
removed either from their underarms or their groin because one of the jobs of those lymph nodes is to remove and destroy that bacteria so if you have fewer lymph nodes to protect your arm or,51.449,21.421,72.87,angry
your leg you are a little bit higher risk of getting a cellulitis type infection now obviously the area that you are at risk for cellulitis will correspond to where you had your lymph,62.37,22.830000000000002,85.2,angry
nodes removed so if you have lymph nodes removed from your right X Allah your right arm is at risk if you have lymph nodes removed from your left groin it is your left leg that is at risk cellulitis,73.59,25.859999999999996,99.45,angry
will typically most often present itself as redness in that arm or that leg it can also be associated with tenderness warmth and increased swelling or edema most common symptom will be redness so,85.71,38.217999999999996,123.928,angry
if you see redness and don't feel any heat or tenderness or swelling I still want you to call your physician or nurse right away anyway cellulitis can be a big deal for a couple of reasons number,105.509,26.67,132.179,angry
one if left untreated it can spread to your lymph nodes and your blood stream and can potentially make you pretty sick especially if you are elderly have a lot of other health problems or have just,118.259,24.991000000000003,143.25,angry
had chemotherapy and you are immune first chances are if you're in one of those situations you're going to let end up in the hospital on IV antibiotics to treat that cellulitis secondly,131.459,24.950000000000003,156.409,angry
cellulitis in your involved arm or leg is also one of the biggest precipitators of causing lymphedema and sometimes those lymphedema go away when the infection goes away but sometimes they,143.629,23.35,166.97899999999998,angry
can be permanent so again if you see redness or feel warmth or tenderness or see swelling we want you to call your physician or nurse practitioner and get on an oral antibiotic right away now,155.64,22.831,178.47099999999998,angry
again because the body does not regrow lymph nodes your risk for cellulitis is technically lifelong some people however will go an entire lifetime without ever getting a cellulitis in their armor,166.95,22.38,189.32999999999998,angry
their leg where other people unfortunately seem to get them all the time even they live even though they follow all the right rules the best way to minimize your risk of getting a,178.62,22.499,201.119,angry
cellulitis is to protect your skin protect it from scrapes scratches burns punctures or bites now that doesn't mean that you stop doing the things that you enjoy,189.299,23.069999999999997,212.369,angry
I still want you gardening and playing golf and out hiking and doing all that stuff just protect your skin while you are doing those activities if by some chance you do scrape scratched burn or,200.7,23.069000000000003,223.769,angry
puncturing your puncture your arm or leg in some way you're going to keep that area clean you're going to keep an eye on it and if it doesn't look like it's healing normally you're gonna give your,212.849,18.962,231.81099999999998,angry
doctor or nurse a call now I do want to point out that when you get needle punctures or IVs in a doctor's office or in the hospital those are sterile and those are absolutely okay and safe to,221.04,26.249,247.289,angry
review cellulitis is a bacterial infection right underneath the skin that people that have had lymph nodes removed are more at risk of getting we want to jump on it really quickly if you do see,234.81,22.77,257.58,angry
redness warmth or tenderness or swelling because we don't want it to lead to a bigger infection or precipitate a lymphedema so you're going to give your physician or nurse a call right away,246.299,23.101,269.4,angry
