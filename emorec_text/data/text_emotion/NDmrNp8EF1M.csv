the recovery room we're talking,3.03,4.59,7.619999999999999,fear
cellulitis a type of infection that,4.94,4.36,9.3,fear
people who have had lymph nodes removed,7.62,3.899,11.519,fear
from their underarms or their groin are,9.3,4.919,14.219000000000001,fear
more at risk of getting now I know it's,11.519,4.831,16.35,fear
not exciting I know it's not fun but it,14.219,3.81,18.029,sad
is a really important topic and I'd,16.35,3.36,19.71,sad
rather you learn it here in the recovery,18.029,4.021,22.05,fear
room then in urgent care,19.71,4.44,24.150000000000002,fear
hi I'm cancer physical therapy,22.05,4.44,26.490000000000002,fear
specialist dr. Leslie walki welcome to,24.15,4.459,28.608999999999998,fear
the recovery room today we're talking,26.49,6.24,32.73,fear
cellulitis what it is why it can be such,28.609,6.371,34.980000000000004,fear
a big deal how you can minimize your,32.73,5.04,37.769999999999996,fear
risk of getting it and what to do if you,34.98,8.28,43.26,fear
do get it let's break it down cellulitis,37.77,7.8,45.57,fear
is a bacterial infection that occurs,43.26,6.029,49.289,fear
right underneath the skin it is most,45.57,5.879,51.449,fear
common in people who've had lymph nodes,49.289,4.351,53.64,fear
removed either from their underarms or,51.449,4.831,56.28,fear
their groin because one of the jobs of,53.64,4.59,58.230000000000004,fear
those lymph nodes is to remove and,56.28,4.02,60.3,fear
destroy that bacteria so if you have,58.23,4.14,62.37,fear
fewer lymph nodes to protect your arm or,60.3,3.84,64.14,fear
your leg you are a little bit higher,62.37,4.38,66.75,fear
risk of getting a cellulitis type,64.14,5.85,69.99,fear
infection now obviously the area that,66.75,4.619,71.369,fear
you are at risk for cellulitis will,69.99,3.6,73.58999999999999,fear
correspond to where you had your lymph,71.369,4.381,75.75,fear
nodes removed so if you have lymph nodes,73.59,4.68,78.27000000000001,fear
removed from your right X Allah your,75.75,4.29,80.04,fear
right arm is at risk if you have lymph,78.27,3.63,81.89999999999999,fear
nodes removed from your left groin it is,80.04,5.67,85.71000000000001,happy
your left leg that is at risk cellulitis,81.9,7.59,89.49000000000001,fear
will typically most often present itself,85.71,8.25,93.96,fear
as redness in that arm or that leg it,89.49,7.07,96.56,fear
can also be associated with tenderness,93.96,8.21,102.16999999999999,fear
warmth and increased swelling or edema,96.56,8.949,105.509,fear
most common symptom will be redness so,102.17,5.739,107.909,fear
if you see redness and don't feel any,105.509,5.281,110.79,fear
heat or tenderness or swelling I still,107.909,4.861,112.77000000000001,fear
want you to call your physician or nurse,110.79,5.759,116.549,fear
right away anyway cellulitis can be a,112.77,5.489,118.259,fear
big deal for a couple of reasons number,116.549,5.28,121.82900000000001,happy
one if left untreated it can spread to,118.259,5.82,124.07900000000001,fear
your lymph nodes and your blood stream,121.829,4.08,125.90899999999999,fear
and can potentially make you pretty sick,124.079,4.921,129.0,fear
especially if you are elderly have a lot,125.909,5.55,131.459,fear
of other health problems or have just,129.0,4.62,133.62,fear
had chemotherapy and you are immune,131.459,4.2,135.659,fear
first chances are if you're in one of,133.62,3.66,137.28,sad
those situations you're going to let end,135.659,4.47,140.129,sad
up in the hospital on IV antibiotics to,137.28,6.349,143.629,fear
treat that cellulitis secondly,140.129,6.271,146.39999999999998,fear
cellulitis in your involved arm or leg,143.629,5.08,148.709,fear
is also one of the biggest precipitators,146.4,5.759,152.159,sad
of causing lymphedema and sometimes,148.709,4.92,153.629,happy
those lymphedema go away when the,152.159,3.481,155.64,fear
infection goes away but sometimes they,153.629,4.11,157.739,fear
can be permanent so again if you see,155.64,4.53,160.17,fear
redness or feel warmth or tenderness or,157.739,4.231,161.97,fear
see swelling we want you to call your,160.17,3.959,164.129,fear
physician or nurse practitioner and get,161.97,4.98,166.95,fear
on an oral antibiotic right away now,164.129,5.131,169.26,fear
again because the body does not regrow,166.95,4.98,171.92999999999998,fear
lymph nodes your risk for cellulitis is,169.26,5.67,174.92999999999998,fear
technically lifelong some people however,171.93,5.16,177.09,fear
will go an entire lifetime without ever,174.93,3.69,178.62,fear
getting a cellulitis in their armor,177.09,2.88,179.97,fear
their leg where other people,178.62,3.39,182.01,fear
unfortunately seem to get them all the,179.97,3.51,183.48,fear
time even they live even though they,182.01,5.19,187.2,fear
follow all the right rules the best way,183.48,5.819,189.29899999999998,fear
to minimize your risk of getting a,187.2,4.59,191.79,fear
cellulitis is to protect your skin,189.299,5.731,195.03,fear
protect it from scrapes scratches burns,191.79,6.9,198.69,fear
punctures or bites now that doesn't mean,195.03,5.25,200.28,fear
that you stop doing the things that you,198.69,2.01,200.7,fear
enjoy,200.28,3.179,203.459,fear
I still want you gardening and playing,200.7,5.039,205.73899999999998,fear
golf and out hiking and doing all that,203.459,4.56,208.019,fear
stuff just protect your skin while you,205.739,4.771,210.51,fear
are doing those activities if by some,208.019,4.83,212.84900000000002,fear
chance you do scrape scratched burn or,210.51,3.869,214.379,fear
puncturing your puncture your arm or leg,212.849,3.211,216.06,sad
in some way you're going to keep that,214.379,3.42,217.79899999999998,sad
area clean you're going to keep an eye,216.06,3.299,219.359,fear
on it and if it doesn't look like it's,217.799,3.241,221.04000000000002,fear
healing normally you're gonna give your,219.359,5.791,225.15,sad

punctures or IVs in a doctor's office or,226.859,4.59,231.449,fear
in the hospital those are sterile and,229.139,5.671,234.81,fear
those are absolutely okay and safe to,231.449,6.18,237.62900000000002,fear

infection right underneath the skin that,237.629,3.661,241.29,fear

redness warmth or tenderness or swelling,246.299,4.711,251.01000000000002,fear
because we don't want it to lead to a,248.91,4.259,253.16899999999998,fear
bigger infection or precipitate a,251.01,3.78,254.79,fear
