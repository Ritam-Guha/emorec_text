hey it's me Angela I'm here to talk to,0.0,5.25,5.25,fear
you today about something that a lot of,2.909,5.491,8.399999999999999,fear
people either ask me right away or later,5.25,5.49,10.74,fear
tell me that they wanted to ask but,8.4,3.96,12.36,fear
didn't really know how to bring it up,10.74,4.92,15.66,neutral
initially which is what has been the,12.36,5.7,18.06,fear
hardest part about this surgery and I,15.66,4.98,20.64,fear
was thinking about it and instantly I,18.06,4.59,22.65,fear
thought about changing my routines,20.64,4.309,24.949,fear
learning how to eat differently,22.65,4.92,27.57,fear
exercising learning to relate to people,24.949,5.111,30.060000000000002,fear
a little bit differently but then I was,27.57,5.16,32.730000000000004,fear
talking to my oldest daughter and she,30.06,4.409,34.469,fear
brought up a really good question she,32.73,3.9,36.629999999999995,fear
told me mom I don't think that anybody's,34.469,3.631,38.1,fear
gonna really want to watch your videos,36.63,3.57,40.2,fear
unless they can understand why you,38.1,3.75,41.85,fear
wanted to have the surgery in the first,40.2,4.08,44.28,fear
place like I really don't care what you,41.85,4.529,46.379000000000005,fear
have to say unless I know why I'm not,44.28,4.29,48.57,fear
saying that y'all feel that way but she,46.379,4.141,50.519999999999996,fear
brought up a really good point and it,48.57,4.919,53.489,fear
made me realize that the hardest part,50.52,5.519,56.039,fear
about having this surgery like God's,53.489,5.131,58.62,fear
honest truth was signing up for the,56.039,4.831,60.870000000000005,fear
classes that I needed to take to get the,58.62,5.64,64.25999999999999,neutral
surgery I was heartbroken when I,60.87,7.41,68.28,fear
realized that I am actually a candidate,64.26,6.87,71.13000000000001,fear
for bariatric surgery like what does,68.28,5.28,73.56,fear
that mean for my life how heavy have I,71.13,5.22,76.35,fear
let myself get how out of shape am i why,73.56,5.01,78.57000000000001,fear
did I do this to myself what am i doing,76.35,4.559,80.90899999999999,fear
why haven't I stopped like what the heck,78.57,4.86,83.42999999999999,fear
is happening that I actually qualify for,80.909,5.191,86.10000000000001,fear
bariatric surgery that blew my mind and,83.43,4.74,88.17,fear
I don't mean this to come off wrong at,86.1,4.409,90.509,fear
all but it's not something that you ever,88.17,4.08,92.25,fear
really think that you're gonna go,90.509,3.271,93.78,fear
through in your life and at the time,92.25,3.479,95.729,fear
when I looked in the mirror like I knew,93.78,4.29,98.07000000000001,neutral
I was heavy but I didn't feel like I was,95.729,5.64,101.369,fear
bariatric surgery heavy but clearly I,98.07,6.63,104.69999999999999,fear
was going to those classes and spending,101.369,5.761,107.13,fear
the six months in those classes coming,104.7,5.16,109.86,fear
to terms with the emotional reasons that,107.13,5.099,112.229,fear
were tied to my eating habits that was,109.86,5.16,115.02,fear
tough it's still hard now because I'm,112.229,5.811,118.03999999999999,fear
constantly grappling with my emotional,115.02,5.669,120.689,fear
relationship with food and it's changed,118.04,4.78,122.82000000000001,fear
so much and I find myself wanting to,120.689,4.651,125.33999999999999,fear
like go back and beat my old self up for,122.82,5.07,127.88999999999999,fear
getting to where I got and I'm not going,125.34,3.75,129.09,fear
to do that in order to have the,127.89,3.82,131.71,fear
bariatric surgery at the time that I,129.09,4.84,133.93,fear
through the program with my insurance,131.71,5.25,136.96,fear
provider we had to take six months of,133.93,5.1,139.03,fear
health classes where you learn about,136.96,5.16,142.12,fear
nutrition eating habits you explore your,139.03,5.52,144.55,fear
relationship with food and you learn all,142.12,4.89,147.01,fear
about the surgery itself the risks of,144.55,5.16,149.71,fear
surgery and how to get by,147.01,5.13,152.14,fear
after surgery so it was really,149.71,4.11,153.82000000000002,fear
educational some weeks were more,152.14,3.21,155.35,fear
interesting than others it was a once a,153.82,3.27,157.09,fear
week class I made some really good,155.35,3.63,158.98,fear
friends in that class who we just got,157.09,3.93,161.02,surprise
really close and we connected and,158.98,3.87,162.85,sad
clicked and we've been able to support,161.02,4.11,165.13000000000002,neutral
each other since having the surgery and,162.85,4.2,167.04999999999998,neutral
we check in on each other so I really do,165.13,4.8,169.93,neutral
value that when I think about what has,167.05,5.94,172.99,fear
been the hardest part about having the,169.93,5.07,175.0,fear
surgery it was deciding to have it in,172.99,4.26,177.25,fear
the first place it was really coming to,175.0,5.55,180.55,fear
terms with where I am physically and and,177.25,5.67,182.92,fear
what I had done to my body to answer my,180.55,4.8,185.35000000000002,fear
daughter's question which is why did I,182.92,4.29,187.20999999999998,fear
have the surgery that was tough -,185.35,5.01,190.35999999999999,neutral
because I didn't have as serious of,187.21,5.49,192.70000000000002,neutral
problems as some of the other people did,190.36,5.07,195.43,fear
who I know have had the surgery but I,192.7,5.7,198.39999999999998,fear
thought to myself self you're working so,195.43,6.57,202.0,fear
hard at an institution where you're,198.4,6.27,204.67000000000002,fear
earning a great pension and at the same,202.0,5.16,207.16,neutral
time you aren't eating and killing,204.67,4.65,209.32,neutral
yourself so what's the point of working,207.16,4.44,211.6,neutral
so hard for a retirement that you may,209.32,5.55,214.87,neutral
never get to get to or you may never get,211.6,5.4,217.0,fear
to enjoy because you'll be obese and,214.87,4.11,218.98000000000002,fear
you're not gonna be able to do anything,217.0,4.02,221.02,fear
I had the surgery for my own future I,218.98,4.56,223.54,fear
had it for the future of my children for,221.02,4.71,225.73000000000002,fear
the future of my marriage the future of,223.54,4.83,228.37,fear
whatever it is that God has had in store,225.73,4.71,230.44,fear
for me all of this time it was an,228.37,5.01,233.38,neutral
investment and it totally freaked me out,230.44,5.67,236.10999999999999,neutral
and it totally offended me that I,233.38,5.79,239.17,neutral
qualified for this I just felt like whoa,236.11,4.98,241.09,neutral
I can't believe that I've gotten to this,239.17,4.26,243.42999999999998,fear
place but then I quickly let that go and,241.09,5.04,246.13,fear
I decided I'm here I want better I can,243.43,4.62,248.05,fear
do better I've got this great health,246.13,3.96,250.09,fear

this weight off so I can make better,250.09,4.08,254.17000000000002,neutral
choices and that's what I did and you,251.74,4.89,256.63,neutral
know what I do not regret it as hard as,254.17,5.819,259.989,neutral
it was to hear the truth about where I,256.63,5.789,262.419,neutral
was physically it was so worth it and,259.989,4.231,264.21999999999997,neutral
I'd do it all over again I,262.419,4.621,267.03999999999996,neutral
