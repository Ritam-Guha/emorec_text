hey it's me Angela I'm here to talk to you today about something that a lot of people either ask me right away or later tell me that they wanted to ask but didn't really know how to bring it up,0.0,25.111000000000004,25.111000000000004,angry
initially which is what has been the hardest part about this surgery and I was thinking about it and instantly I thought about changing my routines learning how to eat differently,12.36,24.499000000000002,36.859,angry
exercising learning to relate to people a little bit differently but then I was talking to my oldest daughter and she brought up a really good question she told me mom I don't think that anybody's,24.949,22.211,47.16,angry
gonna really want to watch your videos unless they can understand why you wanted to have the surgery in the first place like I really don't care what you have to say unless I know why I'm not,36.63,20.219,56.849000000000004,angry
saying that y'all feel that way but she brought up a really good point and it made me realize that the hardest part about having this surgery like God's honest truth was signing up for the,46.379,24.541,70.92,angry
classes that I needed to take to get the surgery I was heartbroken when I realized that I am actually a candidate for bariatric surgery like what does that mean for my life how heavy have I,58.62,30.42,89.03999999999999,angry
let myself get how out of shape am i why did I do this to myself what am i doing why haven't I stopped like what the heck is happening that I actually qualify for bariatric surgery that blew my mind and,73.56,24.36,97.92,angry
I don't mean this to come off wrong at all but it's not something that you ever really think that you're gonna go through in your life and at the time when I looked in the mirror like I knew,86.1,19.529,105.62899999999999,angry
I was heavy but I didn't feel like I was bariatric surgery heavy but clearly I was going to those classes and spending the six months in those classes coming to terms with the emotional reasons that,95.729,28.29,124.019,angry
were tied to my eating habits that was tough it's still hard now because I'm constantly grappling with my emotional relationship with food and it's changed so much and I find myself wanting to,109.86,26.071,135.931,angry
like go back and beat my old self up for getting to where I got and I'm not going to do that in order to have the bariatric surgery at the time that I through the program with my insurance,122.82,22.73,145.54999999999998,angry
provider we had to take six months of health classes where you learn about nutrition eating habits you explore your relationship with food and you learn all about the surgery itself the risks of,133.93,25.83,159.76,fear
surgery and how to get by after surgery so it was really educational some weeks were more interesting than others it was a once a week class I made some really good,147.01,19.349999999999998,166.35999999999999,angry
friends in that class who we just got really close and we connected and clicked and we've been able to support each other since having the surgery and we check in on each other so I really do,157.09,20.91,178.0,angry
value that when I think about what has been the hardest part about having the surgery it was deciding to have it in the first place it was really coming to terms with where I am physically and and,167.05,26.490000000000002,193.54000000000002,fear
what I had done to my body to answer my daughter's question which is why did I have the surgery that was tough - because I didn't have as serious of problems as some of the other people did,180.55,24.66,205.21,fear
who I know have had the surgery but I thought to myself self you're working so hard at an institution where you're earning a great pension and at the same time you aren't eating and killing,192.7,28.35,221.04999999999998,fear
yourself so what's the point of working so hard for a retirement that you may never get to get to or you may never get to enjoy because you'll be obese and you're not gonna be able to do anything,207.16,23.52,230.68,fear
I had the surgery for my own future I had it for the future of my children for the future of my marriage the future of whatever it is that God has had in store for me all of this time it was an,218.98,23.82,242.79999999999998,angry
investment and it totally freaked me out and it totally offended me that I qualified for this I just felt like whoa I can't believe that I've gotten to this place but then I quickly let that go and,230.44,25.740000000000002,256.18,angry
I decided I'm here I want better I can do better I've got this great health insurance that is going to help me get this weight off so I can make better choices and that's what I did and you,243.43,21.240000000000002,264.67,fear
know what I do not regret it as hard as it was to hear the truth about where I was physically it was so worth it and I'd do it all over again I have no regrets about having this,254.17,25.53,279.7,fear
surgery so if it's something you're thinking about having or one of your loved ones is having the surgery yeah it is totally a nerve-wracking thing it's very emotional and there's a lot of,267.04,23.58,290.62,fear
physical changes that are gonna happen and a lot of relationship changes that are going to occur as a result of changing this person's relationship with food but if you have any questions about,279.28,22.200000000000003,301.47999999999996,fear
