there are per serving of that food,54.8,5.12,59.919999999999995,sad
so you take the gi or the glycemic index,56.8,3.84,60.64,sad
number,59.92,1.92,61.84,neutral
multiply it by the number of,60.64,3.36,64.0,happy
carbohydrates there are per serving,61.84,5.2,67.04,happy
then divide that number by 100 this is,64.0,4.479,68.479,NA
your glycemic load,67.04,3.119,70.159,NA
or again how much it would affect your,68.479,3.68,72.159,NA
