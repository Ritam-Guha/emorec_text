hey I want to do a quick video on why,0.03,4.32,4.3500000000000005,
someone would have high blood glucose on,2.22,4.77,6.99,
keto and intermittent fasting so I've,4.35,4.65,9.0,
talked about this in other videos but I,6.99,3.87,10.86,
wanted to do one video on this one,9.0,5.13,14.129999999999999,
specific point okay when your insulin,10.86,5.94,16.8,
resistant which great majority of the,14.13,6.12,20.25,
population is they usually have high,16.8,7.069,23.869,
amounts of insulin in their body okay,20.25,6.599,26.849,
five to nine times the normal amount,23.869,5.291,29.16,
okay so they have massive amounts of,26.849,5.791,32.64,
insulin now insulin regulates blood,29.16,5.82,34.980000000000004,
sugars by controlling them pushing them,32.64,6.0,38.64,
down so they they basically lower blood,34.98,6.78,41.76,
sugar so if you have all this insulin in,38.64,5.7,44.34,
the body you're automatically pushing in,41.76,4.92,46.68,
keeping the blood sugar controlled,44.34,6.12,50.46,
that's the purpose of it okay so here,46.68,5.73,52.41,
you are going along you know you could,50.46,4.65,55.11,
be eating junk food sugar whatever but,52.41,4.35,56.76,
you still have normal blood glucose,55.11,4.32,59.43,
because the high insulin is pushing it,56.76,5.4,62.16,
down and you do that for ten years,59.43,4.619,64.049,
whatever and then eventually the,62.16,4.65,66.81,
mechanism breaks where the cells of the,64.049,5.671,69.72000000000001,fear
pancreas get exhausted and then the,66.81,5.22,72.03,
insulin goes down and then the blood,69.72,4.41,74.13,
sugar just go up that's when you start,72.03,3.54,75.57000000000001,surprise
having pre-diabetes and then they go up,74.13,3.059,77.189,surprise
higher and you get diabetes that's how,75.57,2.39,77.96,surprise
it works,77.189,5.101,82.28999999999999,
but the point is that before keto you,77.96,7.81,85.77,
probably had high insulin and now you,82.29,5.7,87.99000000000001,
get on keto in a minute fasting you're,85.77,4.38,90.14999999999999,
taking all this insulin out of the,87.99,3.419,91.40899999999999,
picture you're healing insulin,90.15,3.21,93.36,
resistance and you're lowering insulin,91.409,3.841,95.25,
to the point where it's going to be,93.36,2.7,96.06,
normal,95.25,3.36,98.61,
well guess what since your body is so,96.06,5.55,101.61,
used to this you remove that push down,98.61,5.399,104.009,
force and the blood sugars are going to,101.61,5.28,106.89,
go up that's why but it's only going to,104.009,4.531,108.54,
be for a period of time it's in the,106.89,3.509,110.399,
transition phase but you're just taking,108.54,5.52,114.06,
this weight off of blood sugars and it's,110.399,4.921,115.32000000000001,
just going to start to rebound a little,114.06,3.599,117.659,
bit okay but the point is it will,115.32,3.99,119.30999999999999,
eventually come down now it's not going,117.659,3.99,121.649,
to go too high it might come up to 110,119.31,5.73,125.04,
but it's it might not be down here for a,121.649,5.311,126.96000000000001,
while so you all you have to realize is,125.04,3.87,128.91,
that you're actually getting better,126.96,4.109,131.069,
insulin is coming down blood sugars are,128.91,4.17,133.07999999999998,
coming higher and you just need to give,131.069,2.801,133.86999999999998,
it more time,133.08,4.42,137.5,
