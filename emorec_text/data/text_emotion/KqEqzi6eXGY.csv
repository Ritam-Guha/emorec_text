hey I want to do a quick video on why,0.03,4.32,4.3500000000000005,neutral
someone would have high blood glucose on,2.22,4.77,6.99,NA
keto and intermittent fasting so I've,4.35,4.65,9.0,neutral
talked about this in other videos but I,6.99,3.87,10.86,neutral
wanted to do one video on this one,9.0,5.13,14.129999999999999,neutral
specific point okay when your insulin,10.86,5.94,16.8,neutral
resistant which great majority of the,14.13,6.12,20.25,NA
population is they usually have high,16.8,7.069,23.869,NA
amounts of insulin in their body okay,20.25,6.599,26.849,neutral
five to nine times the normal amount,23.869,5.291,29.16,neutral
okay so they have massive amounts of,26.849,5.791,32.64,neutral
insulin now insulin regulates blood,29.16,5.82,34.980000000000004,neutral
sugars by controlling them pushing them,32.64,6.0,38.64,neutral
down so they they basically lower blood,34.98,6.78,41.76,neutral
sugar so if you have all this insulin in,38.64,5.7,44.34,NA
the body you're automatically pushing in,41.76,4.92,46.68,NA
keeping the blood sugar controlled,44.34,6.12,50.46,neutral
that's the purpose of it okay so here,46.68,5.73,52.41,neutral
you are going along you know you could,50.46,4.65,55.11,NA
be eating junk food sugar whatever but,52.41,4.35,56.76,neutral
you still have normal blood glucose,55.11,4.32,59.43,neutral
because the high insulin is pushing it,56.76,5.4,62.16,neutral
down and you do that for ten years,59.43,4.619,64.049,neutral
whatever and then eventually the,62.16,4.65,66.81,NA
mechanism breaks where the cells of the,64.049,5.671,69.72000000000001,neutral
pancreas get exhausted and then the,66.81,5.22,72.03,neutral
insulin goes down and then the blood,69.72,4.41,74.13,neutral
sugar just go up that's when you start,72.03,3.54,75.57000000000001,neutral
having pre-diabetes and then they go up,74.13,3.059,77.189,neutral
higher and you get diabetes that's how,75.57,2.39,77.96,neutral
it works,77.189,5.101,82.28999999999999,neutral
but the point is that before keto you,77.96,7.81,85.77,neutral
probably had high insulin and now you,82.29,5.7,87.99000000000001,NA
get on keto in a minute fasting you're,85.77,4.38,90.14999999999999,NA
taking all this insulin out of the,87.99,3.419,91.40899999999999,NA
picture you're healing insulin,90.15,3.21,93.36,NA
resistance and you're lowering insulin,91.409,3.841,95.25,NA
to the point where it's going to be,93.36,2.7,96.06,NA
normal,95.25,3.36,98.61,NA
well guess what since your body is so,96.06,5.55,101.61,neutral
used to this you remove that push down,98.61,5.399,104.009,neutral
force and the blood sugars are going to,101.61,5.28,106.89,NA
go up that's why but it's only going to,104.009,4.531,108.54,NA
be for a period of time it's in the,106.89,3.509,110.399,NA
transition phase but you're just taking,108.54,5.52,114.06,NA
this weight off of blood sugars and it's,110.399,4.921,115.32000000000001,NA
just going to start to rebound a little,114.06,3.599,117.659,NA
bit okay but the point is it will,115.32,3.99,119.30999999999999,NA
eventually come down now it's not going,117.659,3.99,121.649,neutral
to go too high it might come up to 110,119.31,5.73,125.04,neutral
but it's it might not be down here for a,121.649,5.311,126.96000000000001,neutral
while so you all you have to realize is,125.04,3.87,128.91,NA
that you're actually getting better,126.96,4.109,131.069,NA
insulin is coming down blood sugars are,128.91,4.17,133.07999999999998,NA
coming higher and you just need to give,131.069,2.801,133.86999999999998,NA
it more time,133.08,4.42,137.5,NA
okay all right thanks for watching so,133.87,4.71,138.58,NA
