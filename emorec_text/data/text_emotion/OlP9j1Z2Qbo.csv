hi guys in this video we're going to,0.0,4.1,4.1,surprise
talk about vitamin b1 and diabetes okay,1.14,6.21,7.35,surprise
so people that are a diabetic type 1 or,4.1,6.91,11.01,surprise
type 2 are severely deficient in vitamin,7.35,6.539,13.889,surprise
b1 in fact pre-diabetes like insulin,11.01,5.79,16.8,surprise
resistance those cases are also very,13.889,4.89,18.779,fear
deficient in vitamin b1 because vitamin,16.8,5.639,22.439,surprise
b1 is the main cofactor like the helper,18.779,5.941,24.72,surprise
vitamin for the enzymes related to,22.439,5.34,27.779,fear
carbohydrate and glucose metabolism it's,24.72,5.94,30.66,fear
involved with glucose and sugar it,27.779,5.19,32.969,fear
supports the myelin sheath that's the,30.66,4.32,34.980000000000004,fear
outer sheath around the nervous system,32.969,4.201,37.17,surprise
so when your sugar is too high and you,34.98,4.14,39.12,surprise
don't have enough b1 because this gets,37.17,3.54,40.71,fear
depleted and it gets altered you can't,39.12,3.84,42.959999999999994,surprise
absorb it as much then you start losing,40.71,4.619,45.329,surprise
this sheath or protective lining around,42.96,4.41,47.370000000000005,fear
the nerve then you start to notice that,45.329,4.261,49.59,happy
tingling in your feet pain burning and,47.37,4.5,51.87,NA
the fingertips and that's the loss of,49.59,4.8,54.39,fear
myelin because the b1 is not there to,51.87,4.349,56.218999999999994,fear
protect the nerves and build the nerves,54.39,4.23,58.620000000000005,fear
b1 supports the inside of your arteries,56.219,3.451,59.67,NA
that little lining called the,58.62,3.84,62.459999999999994,NA
endothelium so if you don't have b1 you,59.67,5.309,64.979,surprise
have all sorts of damage in the artery,62.46,4.5,66.96000000000001,surprise
wall which can't then could lead to a,64.979,4.32,69.299,surprise
cholesterol buildup a clot a stroke and,66.96,4.229,71.189,fear
cardiac I which is basically just heart,69.299,4.291,73.59,fear
disease so b1 supports the nerves in the,71.189,5.22,76.40899999999999,fear
eye especially the retina that is why so,73.59,5.37,78.96000000000001,fear
many diabetics have problems with vision,76.409,4.561,80.97,fear
a vitamin b1 deficiency will also create,78.96,3.51,82.47,fear
edema or that's swelling around your,80.97,4.41,85.38,NA
ankles and your feet and even swelling,82.47,4.89,87.36,fear
around the eyes a b1 deficiency will,85.38,4.47,89.85,fear
also cause sleep apnea and another big,87.36,4.74,92.1,fear
problem that a b1 deficiency can create,89.85,3.69,93.53999999999999,NA
is a problem with something called the,92.1,3.57,95.66999999999999,fear
autonomic nervous system that is the,93.54,3.509,97.049,fear
part of the nervous system that is,95.67,4.019,99.68900000000001,fear
working in the background an automatic,97.049,4.5,101.549,fear
that controls a lot of your organs and,99.689,4.32,104.00899999999999,fear
if that system becomes dysfunctional you,101.549,4.741,106.29,fear
start getting sweating on the hands the,104.009,3.961,107.97,fear
palms you might get out of shower and,106.29,4.74,111.03,fear
just break out in a sweat increase pulse,107.97,5.939,113.90899999999999,fear
rate a skin allergy when you scratch,111.03,4.379,115.409,fear
your skin you see that little white,113.909,4.5,118.409,fear
welting like a histamine reaction that's,115.409,5.661,121.07000000000001,fear
a b1 deficiency and a DD,118.409,4.291,122.7,fear
attention-deficit disorder,121.07,4.299,125.369,fear
I mean how many kids that you know have,122.7,5.61,128.31,fear
this problem and maybe we haven't had it,125.369,5.071,130.44,fear
bad enough to develop all these yet but,128.31,4.2,132.51,surprise
they're starting to show signs early why,130.44,2.89,133.32999999999998,NA
because Vout,132.51,3.61,136.12,fear
B deficiencies are very very common not,133.33,5.31,138.64000000000001,fear
just with adults but children as well so,136.12,4.17,140.29,NA
this is how you create a b1 deficiency,138.64,3.78,142.42,NA
start consuming a lot of refined,140.29,3.84,144.13,NA
carbohydrates in the form of bread pasta,142.42,3.39,145.80999999999997,fear
cereal crackers biscuits waffles,144.13,5.64,149.76999999999998,fear
pancakes start consuming sugar start,145.81,6.6,152.41,fear
taking diuretics alcohol white rice,149.77,5.46,155.23000000000002,fear
flour products fructose like in high,152.41,6.51,158.92,NA
fructose corn syrup sulfites stress will,155.23,7.23,162.45999999999998,NA
do it medication gastric bypass all of,158.92,5.9,164.82,fear
these will create a b1 deficiency and,162.46,4.86,167.32000000000002,fear
having high blood sugars being a,164.82,5.71,170.53,fear
diabetic also creates a b1 deficiency so,167.32,5.58,172.9,NA
the need for vitamin b1 goes up,170.53,4.23,174.76,surprise
considerably so if I was a diabetic or a,172.9,5.43,178.33,fear
pre-diabetic I would consume more b1 to,174.76,6.03,180.79,fear
actually help make up the damage the,178.33,4.59,182.92000000000002,fear
best source of b1 is nutritional yeast,180.79,5.46,186.25,fear
not synthetic b1 get it in a whole,182.92,6.21,189.13,fear
complex and make sure it's non fortified,186.25,4.38,190.63,fear
because they always add the synthetic,189.13,3.93,193.06,fear
vitamins in there alright thanks for,190.63,4.74,195.37,fear
watching hey thank you so much for,193.06,4.14,197.2,fear
watching keep spreading the word and,195.37,4.52,199.89000000000001,fear
