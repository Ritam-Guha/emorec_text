hi guys in this video we're going to talk about vitamin b1 and diabetes okay so people that are a diabetic type 1 or type 2 are severely deficient in vitamin b1 in fact pre-diabetes like insulin,0.0,29.549,29.549,NA
resistance those cases are also very deficient in vitamin b1 because vitamin b1 is the main cofactor like the helper vitamin for the enzymes related to carbohydrate and glucose metabolism it's,13.889,27.75,41.638999999999996,NA
involved with glucose and sugar it supports the myelin sheath that's the outer sheath around the nervous system so when your sugar is too high and you don't have enough b1 because this gets,27.779,21.391000000000002,49.17,NA
depleted and it gets altered you can't absorb it as much then you start losing this sheath or protective lining around the nerve then you start to notice that tingling in your feet pain burning and,39.12,21.63,60.75,NA
the fingertips and that's the loss of myelin because the b1 is not there to protect the nerves and build the nerves b1 supports the inside of your arteries that little lining called the,49.59,20.67,70.26,NA
endothelium so if you don't have b1 you have all sorts of damage in the artery wall which can't then could lead to a cholesterol buildup a clot a stroke and cardiac I which is basically just heart,59.67,22.649,82.319,NA
disease so b1 supports the nerves in the eye especially the retina that is why so many diabetics have problems with vision a vitamin b1 deficiency will also create edema or that's swelling around your,71.189,23.071,94.25999999999999,NA
ankles and your feet and even swelling around the eyes a b1 deficiency will also cause sleep apnea and another big problem that a b1 deficiency can create is a problem with something called the,82.47,21.36,103.83,NA
autonomic nervous system that is the part of the nervous system that is working in the background an automatic that controls a lot of your organs and if that system becomes dysfunctional you,93.54,21.089,114.629,NA
start getting sweating on the hands the palms you might get out of shower and just break out in a sweat increase pulse rate a skin allergy when you scratch your skin you see that little white,104.009,23.519,127.52799999999999,NA
welting like a histamine reaction that's a b1 deficiency and a DD attention-deficit disorder I mean how many kids that you know have this problem and maybe we haven't had it,115.409,24.932000000000002,140.341,NA
bad enough to develop all these yet but they're starting to show signs early why because Vout B deficiencies are very very common not just with adults but children as well so,128.31,20.18,148.49,NA
this is how you create a b1 deficiency start consuming a lot of refined carbohydrates in the form of bread pasta cereal crackers biscuits waffles pancakes start consuming sugar start,138.64,23.25,161.89,NA
taking diuretics alcohol white rice flour products fructose like in high fructose corn syrup sulfites stress will do it medication gastric bypass all of these will create a b1 deficiency and,149.77,29.96,179.73000000000002,NA
having high blood sugars being a diabetic also creates a b1 deficiency so the need for vitamin b1 goes up considerably so if I was a diabetic or a pre-diabetic I would consume more b1 to,164.82,26.98,191.79999999999998,NA
actually help make up the damage the best source of b1 is nutritional yeast not synthetic b1 get it in a whole complex and make sure it's non fortified because they always add the synthetic,178.33,24.57,202.9,NA
vitamins in there alright thanks for watching hey thank you so much for watching keep spreading the word and share this video,190.63,16.09,206.72,NA
