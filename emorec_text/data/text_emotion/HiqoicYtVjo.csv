"What's up dudes and what's up ladies? Bryan here 
and in this video we are gonna discuss blood sugar   level. We're gonna discuss what it is, why it's 
important, and some things you can do to keep   yours in check. Let's roll. So, what is blood sugar 
level? Well, blood sugar level is actually exactly   what it sounds like, it's the amount of sugar, 
or glucose, present in the blood. Our body gets   glucose from some of the foods we eat. All right, so 
if we look at this little illustration here, what  ",0.03,32.61,32.64,sad
"we have, is we have the liver, have the pancreas, we 
have blood stream leading from the liver, and one   leading from the pancreas, to this little blue 
area, which is going to contain cells. Now the   cells aren't going to be in just one area. This is 
going to be throughout the body, I've just tried to   simplify this for you, to get you to understand the 
concept. And then over here we have a blood glucose,   blood sugar meter, that we're gonna keep an eye 
on as we go through this. So, after the digestive  ",32.64,30.209999999999997,62.849999999999994,NA
"process the liver is going to release glucose into 
the bloodstream, it's going to send it to the cells   to be used as energy, now, as glucose is released 
into the bloodstream, blood sugar levels are going   to rise, as we can see on our little meter here. 
This triggers the pancreas to release the hormone   insulin, insulin is important because it acts like 
a key master, it tells the cells listen, open up,   let the glucose in. When this happens blood sugar 
levels are gonna decrease, and this process happens  ",62.85,30.060000000000002,92.91,NA
"many times throughout the day, after we eat. Normal 
fasting blood sugar level, that's no food for eight   hours, is gonna be between 70 and 99 milligrams 
per deciliter, and a normal level two hours after   eating, it's gonna be less than 140 milligrams per 
deciliter. So, why is this important? Well there are   three main reasons we need to be aware of our 
blood sugar level. The first reason is that high   blood sugar levels can lead to type 2 diabetes, 
and 95% of all diabetes cases in the U.S. are  ",92.91,30.63,123.53999999999999,NA
"type 2. Type 2 diabetes is when the body doesn't 
use insulin properly, which is insulin resistance,   or when the pancreas stops producing enough 
insulin, as you can see by this animation here,   the bloodstream is just jammed with glucose. Now, 
over time, high blood sugar levels can put a lot   of stress on the pancreas possibly causing it to 
become permanently damaged. Researchers don't fully   understand why some people develop type 2 diabetes 
and others don't, however, there are some factors  ",123.54,28.799999999999997,152.34,NA
"that do increase your risk. Being overweight, the 
more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant   your cells become to insulin, fat distribution, the 
more fat storage in the abdomen area has shown   to increase risk, and then inactivity, physical 
activity helps you control your weight, it also   helps you use up glucose as energy, and makes your 
cells more sensitive to insulin. The second reason   we need to monitor our blood sugar levels is that 
high levels can also lead to atherosclerosis, which  ",152.34,29.609999999999996,181.95,NA
"is hardening and narrowing of the arteries, 
this can block the arteries, which puts blood   flow at risk, which can lead to other problems. The 
third reason is low blood sugar levels. Now, this   is rare in non diabetics and it can be caused by 
certain medications, excessive alcohol consumption,   excessive exercise, eating disorders, and from meals 
high in refined carbohydrates. Recommendations, so,   first and foremost, you're gonna want to have your 
blood sugar level tested from time to time, you can  ",181.95,31.98,213.92999999999998,NA
"discuss that with your doctor, you're gonna want to 
keep yourself at a healthy body weight, you're also   going to want to make sure that you're keeping 
active, hopefully on a daily basis, and try to limit   the amount of refined or processed foods you're 
consuming, try and incorporate as many Whole Foods   in your diet as you can. Alright folks, if you have any
comments or questions you can leave them below, if   you liked or disliked the video hit the thumbs up 
or the thumbs down. Till next time, I'm out, see ya.",213.93,27.21,241.14000000000001,NA
