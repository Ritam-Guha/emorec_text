Two of the goals at Michigan Podiatry,4.49,1.78,6.2700000000000005,angry
are to prevent diabetic foot ulcers,6.27,2.18,8.45,fear
and diabetic foot amputations.,8.45,2.13,10.579999999999998,angry
I am going to discuss diabetic foot ulcers,10.58,2.19,12.77,angry
and what to do if you develop one.,12.77,2.17,14.94,angry
"Remember everything I share
is only for your information.",14.94,3.54,18.48,angry
Before making any medical decisions,18.48,1.81,20.29,angry
"you should talk to a
healthcare professional first.",20.29,2.74,23.03,
"An ulcer or wound is a break
in the skin as seen here.",23.03,4.59,27.62,
The main reasons people with diabetics,27.62,1.9,29.52,
develop foot ulcers are,30.371,1.029,31.4,
"lost of feeling in the foot,",31.4,1.532,32.932,
"poor blood flow to the
foot, increase pressure,",32.932,3.668,36.6,
or direct injury to the foot.,36.6,2.11,38.71,
"Diabetic foot ulcers have
a high risk of infection.",38.71,3.19,41.9,
"Especially if you have had
one for a long period of time.",41.9,2.87,44.769999999999996,fear
"The infection can spread
from the wound to the bone.",44.77,3.33,48.1,angry
"There are antibiotics that
can treat bone infection",48.1,2.46,50.56,angry
"however if the infection
destroys to much bone,",50.56,3.32,53.88,angry
"the bone will need too
be removed or amputated",53.88,2.46,56.34,angry
to promote better healing and provide,56.34,1.93,58.27,angry
a better functioning foot.,58.27,1.5,59.77,angry
If you develop a diabetic foot ulcer,59.77,2.23,62.0,angry
"contact your podiatrist
or healthcare provider",62.0,2.53,64.53,angry
right away so that they can develop,64.53,1.55,66.08,angry
a treatment plan for you.,66.08,1.91,67.99,angry
Your treatment plan will include,67.99,1.39,69.38,angry
"blood work, x-ray or MRI.",69.38,2.6,71.97999999999999,angry

"and how to offload your
wound for better healing.",75.21,3.26,78.47,angry
Offloading means reducing pressure,78.47,1.94,80.41,angry
"and friction to the
wound for better healing.",80.41,2.6,83.00999999999999,

through a total contact cast",83.01,3.15,86.16000000000001,

has a special insert",90.66,2.05,92.71,

to reduce pressure on your wound.,95.2,2.04,97.24000000000001,
