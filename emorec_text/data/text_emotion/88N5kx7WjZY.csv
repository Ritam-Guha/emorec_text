alright let's dive into and stage renal,0.26,4.93,5.1899999999999995,
disease so if you notice in my last,2.85,3.84,6.6899999999999995,angry
video I talked about chronic kidney,5.19,2.999,8.189,angry
disease if you didn't have a chance to,6.69,2.909,9.599,angry
watch it going and take a look at it now,8.189,2.611,10.8,
you'll probably find it in the,9.599,3.721,13.32,angry
description below in stage renal disease,10.8,5.009,15.809000000000001,angry
is chronic kidney disease except for to,13.32,4.289,17.609,angry
the extreme where the kidneys are no,15.809,3.48,19.288999999999998,
longer functioning or just very little,17.609,7.141,24.75,
function so has saved all the same risk,19.289,7.23,26.519000000000002,
factors and causes chronic kidney,24.75,2.609,27.359,
disease,26.519,3.691,30.209999999999997,
signs and symptoms it's just to the,27.359,5.101,32.46,
extreme so really what you'll see with,30.21,3.689,33.899,
these patients is their kidneys aren't,32.46,4.02,36.480000000000004,
predict filtering the waste products so,33.899,4.261,38.160000000000004,
if you look at the labs they're going to,36.48,3.509,39.989,
have way too much potassium magnesium,38.16,4.62,42.779999999999994,
phosphorus they're going to have tons of,39.989,5.721,45.709999999999994,
waste that being Ukrainian we elevated,42.78,5.73,48.510000000000005,
me myself I work on a rental floor when,45.71,4.39,50.1,
I have one these patients are being une,48.51,2.22,50.73,
crannies,50.1,2.22,52.32,
just through the roof at that point you,50.73,3.39,54.12,
don't even really monitor anymore you,52.32,3.6,55.92,angry
start watching the electrolytes more,54.12,3.48,57.599999999999994,
closely and making sure you maintain,55.92,4.08,60.0,
those also these patients are going to,57.6,4.83,62.43,
the risk of fluid overload because of,60.0,5.28,65.28,
not Monica filtering out and maintaining,62.43,3.869,66.299,
their fluid balance because their,65.28,3.03,68.31,
kidneys aren't producing here in fact,66.299,5.43,71.72900000000001,
people of NC area disease sometimes from,68.31,5.489,73.799,
another very little urine or no urine at,71.729,6.39,78.119,
all now these patients tribute for these,73.799,8.131,81.93,angry
patients typically involves dialysis now,78.119,6.981,85.1,
there are several varieties of dialysis,81.93,5.88,87.81,
the two major would being hemodialysis,85.1,5.08,90.17999999999999,
and peritoneal dialysis today I'll talk,87.81,4.349,92.159,
a little bit about hemodialysis and I'm,90.18,3.24,93.42,angry
going to have another video you'll see,92.159,3.03,95.18900000000001,
later in this playlist talking just,93.42,3.87,97.29,
about hemodialysis but care before after,95.189,4.68,99.869,
during and different types of accesses,97.29,5.009,102.299,
so for these patients you want to have,99.869,3.78,103.649,
them on a renal diet which is low in,102.299,4.051,106.35000000000001,
potassium phosphorus sodium and,103.649,5.58,109.229,
magnesium sodium because sodium and,106.35,5.07,111.41999999999999,
water go together so if they have lots,109.229,3.39,112.619,
of sodium in your diet they're going to,111.42,3.059,114.479,
have more fluid staying in their,112.619,3.6,116.219,
bloodstream and it's going to put my,114.479,3.93,118.409,angry
higher risk for fluid overload these,116.219,3.54,119.759,
patients are going to con a fluid,118.409,3.21,121.619,
"restriction typically this is 1,200 to",119.759,4.621,124.38,
"1,500 cc's per day and you want to be",121.619,4.731,126.35,
sure that you educate the patient,124.38,3.849,128.22899999999998,
regularly to make sure they stay,126.35,4.189,130.539,
restrict fluid restrictions you're also,128.229,3.631,131.86,
going to have medications that are,130.539,4.111,134.64999999999998,
binders such as phosphorus binders these,131.86,4.08,135.94000000000003,
are medicines that the patient will take,134.65,2.729,137.37900000000002,
with every meal and it binds with the,135.94,4.2,140.14,
phosphorus in the food so that instead,137.379,4.44,141.819,
of it going into the bloodstream it is,140.14,5.599,145.73899999999998,
excreted in their defecation and,141.819,6.241,148.06,
dialysis now the dialysis is what this,145.739,4.121,149.86,
is going to do is it's going to correct,148.06,3.39,151.45,
electron imbalances and it's going to,149.86,3.659,153.519,
pull off the fluids that the patient is,151.45,5.91,157.35999999999999,angry
no longer able to urinate out so what we,153.519,5.671,159.19,
want to watch out for four of em stage,157.36,4.2,161.56,
renal patients you want to watch out for,159.19,4.29,163.48,
their labs going out of whack and this,161.56,5.34,166.9,
is shown by them having arrhythmias they,163.48,4.83,168.31,
have too much potassium they may be,166.9,3.899,170.799,
having cardiac arrhythmias such as,168.31,6.0,174.31,
ventricular fibrillation or v-tach SVT,170.799,5.16,175.959,
you want to watch for arrhythmias,174.31,3.33,177.64000000000001,
typically these patients are on a,175.959,4.201,180.16,
telemetry much my own monitor you want,177.64,3.78,181.42,
watch for hypertension when they have,180.16,4.139,184.299,angry
fluid overload that's a lot more volume,181.42,4.11,185.53,angry
that's hearts pumping around and they,184.299,3.03,187.329,angry
may have hypertension this puts them of,185.53,5.25,190.78,
course at risk for cardiac problems for,187.329,6.361,193.69,
stroke you also want to watch out for,190.78,3.45,194.23,
angina,193.69,2.879,196.569,
the heart is funk all this extra fluid,194.23,5.25,199.48,
and the electrolytes are off the heart,196.569,4.381,200.95,
is at risk for developing arrhythmias,199.48,3.9,203.38,
which may lead to ischemia to the heart,200.95,5.369,206.319,angry
and so the heart you are at risk for,203.38,5.34,208.72,angry
having myocardial infarctions and so you,206.319,3.661,209.98,angry
want to watch out for them complaining,208.72,4.32,213.04,angry
of chest pains also left fluid overload,209.98,4.68,214.66,angry
will lead to pulmonary edema which is,213.04,3.18,216.22,angry
too much fluid in the body and then it,214.66,4.35,219.01,angry
starts depositing itself around the,216.22,4.829,221.049,fear
lungs so when you go to listen to their,219.01,4.5,223.51,NA
lungs you'll be hearing very moist and,221.049,4.291,225.34,NA
wet sounds or under lungs are having,223.51,3.839,227.349,NA
shortness of breath their own oxygen,225.34,4.14,229.48,NA
saturations are dropping and so you want,227.349,4.32,231.66899999999998,NA
to watch for this in the case of these,229.48,5.93,235.41,NA
typically they may need medication or,231.669,9.21,240.87900000000002,NA
emergency dialysis and so I want you to,235.41,7.24,242.65,NA
go ahead and take a look if you're,240.879,3.991,244.87,NA
sitting humid office my next video is,242.65,3.479,246.12900000000002,NA
going to talk about what you actually do,244.87,3.899,248.769,NA
these patients on a regular day in the,246.129,5.341,251.47,NA
Med surg floor like a renal floor and,248.769,4.08,252.84900000000002,NA
this is where I work every day so I'm,251.47,2.4,253.87,NA
going to talk to you about what we're,252.849,3.121,255.97,NA
going to do to prepare for dialysis what,253.87,3.359,257.229,NA
we're going to do once they're actually,255.97,2.669,258.639,NA
in dialysis and then what we do,257.229,4.07,261.299,NA
once we get them out,258.639,2.66,261.29900000000004,NA
