most of us would assume that fruits are,3.649,4.17,7.819,fear
a high glycemic car because they're so,5.99,4.2,10.190000000000001,fear
sweet but the simple thing is fruit is,7.819,4.171,11.99,fear
metabolized differently and in this,10.19,3.63,13.82,fear
video I want to explain what the five,11.99,4.859,16.849,fear
lowest glycemic fruits are that you can,13.82,4.349,18.169,NA
eat especially as we're getting into,16.849,3.061,19.91,fear
summertime you're going to want to start,18.169,3.061,21.23,fear
eating a little bit more that fresh,19.91,3.75,23.66,fear
fruit the number five low glycemic fruit,21.23,3.9,25.13,NA
is cantaloupe melon,23.66,3.509,27.169,NA
now melons in general are pretty low,25.13,4.17,29.299999999999997,NA
glycemic but cantaloupe takes the cake,27.169,3.93,31.099,NA
and it's also exceptionally high in,29.3,4.68,33.980000000000004,happy
vitamin K which is necessary in order to,31.099,5.67,36.769,NA
absorb vitamin D so it also has some,33.98,4.44,38.419999999999995,NA
crucial minerals to it now here's an,36.769,2.851,39.62,NA
extra little bonus when it comes to,38.42,2.729,41.149,fear
cantaloupe if you eat the cantaloupe,39.62,3.209,42.829,fear
seeds which mind you don't taste all,41.149,4.23,45.379000000000005,fear
that amazing they are an extremely,42.829,5.311,48.14,fear
jam-packed source of omega-3 fatty acids,45.379,4.291,49.67,fear
so not only are you getting the low,48.14,3.75,51.89,fear
glycemic fructose of a cantaloupe but,49.67,3.63,53.300000000000004,fear
you're also getting the same effect that,51.89,3.149,55.039,fear
you might get from say fish oil pills,53.3,4.019,57.318999999999996,happy
now number four you probably didn't even,55.039,3.991,59.03,happy
think this one was a fruit and that's,57.319,4.141,61.46,NA
avocados you see avocados technically,59.03,4.439,63.469,NA
are a fruit and they do have a glycemic,61.46,3.57,65.03,NA
load which means they are going to raise,63.469,3.091,66.56,NA
your blood sugar a little bit but,65.03,3.33,68.36,NA
there's such a high source of omega-3s,66.56,3.36,69.92,fear
and such a high source of healthy fats,68.36,4.35,72.71,fear
it slows the breakdown of those carbs,69.92,4.32,74.24000000000001,fear
now number three is going to be our,72.71,3.69,76.39999999999999,NA
friend grapefruit and grapefruits aren't,74.24,3.63,77.86999999999999,NA
always the sweetest fruit in the world,76.4,3.99,80.39,NA
but they're definitely beneficial when,77.87,4.02,81.89,NA
it comes to your health and the reason,80.39,3.78,84.17,happy
is because they are shown to lower blood,81.89,4.23,86.12,fear
lipid levels they're shown to lower,84.17,4.41,88.58,fear
cholesterol so in addition to being a,86.12,4.44,90.56,fear
great source of B vitamins they're also,88.58,3.69,92.27,fear
going to help you reduce the levels of,90.56,3.81,94.37,NA
fat in your bloodstream they're going to,92.27,3.36,95.63,NA
help you lower those levels of,94.37,3.09,97.46000000000001,NA
cholesterol so you can get on to living,95.63,3.57,99.19999999999999,fear
a healthier life now the number two low,97.46,3.33,100.78999999999999,fear
glycemic fruit is one of my personal,99.2,3.99,103.19,fear
favorites and that is a plum the reason,100.79,4.2,104.99000000000001,fear
that they're so low glycemic is because,103.19,3.6,106.78999999999999,NA
of the effect they have on the digestive,104.99,3.45,108.44,NA
system you see they're a little bit,106.79,3.3,110.09,NA
slower to digest and they're also high,108.44,2.34,110.78,happy
in fiber,110.09,2.52,112.61,fear
hence the old eating prunes to help,110.78,3.81,114.59,fear
digestion kind of thing prunes are just,112.61,4.32,116.93,fear
dried plums you all know how big I am,114.59,4.41,119.0,NA
when it comes to healthy digestion so if,116.93,3.93,120.86000000000001,NA
you can eat a few plums you're getting,119.0,3.75,122.75,fear
that low glycemic effect that low level,120.86,4.2,125.06,fear
of sugar but you're also getting enough,122.75,3.66,126.41,fear
fiber that's going to slow the,125.06,2.94,128.0,happy
absorption of that sugar so you don't,126.41,3.209,129.619,happy
have the quick surge of it affecting,128.0,3.42,131.42,NA
your body and convincing your liver to,129.619,4.581,134.2,NA
store it as fat the number one low,131.42,5.85,137.26999999999998,fear
glycemic fruit is a strawberry,134.2,5.23,139.42999999999998,fear
and if you ever look at a package of,137.27,3.57,140.84,NA
strawberries or you ever look at the,139.43,3.72,143.15,NA
nutrition facts on the strawberry you'll,140.84,4.08,144.92000000000002,NA
find that it takes quite a few,143.15,4.08,147.23000000000002,fear
strawberries even to get yourself to say,144.92,4.98,149.89999999999998,fear
10 or 15 grams of carbs so in addition,147.23,5.46,152.69,happy
to being low in terms of overall carbs,149.9,5.61,155.51000000000002,fear
the actual glycemic load of those carbs,152.69,5.73,158.42,fear
is exceptionally low so if you're going,155.51,4.59,160.1,fear
to indulge I definitely recommend,158.42,3.96,162.38,NA
hitting up the berries adding them to,160.1,4.38,164.48,NA
your pre-workout meal and getting the,162.38,4.02,166.4,fear
benefit of not only a low glycemic carb,164.48,4.11,168.59,fear
but also some antioxidant and,166.4,4.23,170.63,fear
anti-inflammatory benefits see you in,168.59,4.61,173.20000000000002,fear
