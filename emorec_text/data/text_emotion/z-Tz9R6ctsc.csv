you,10.34,2.06,12.4,
you,20.039,2.06,22.099,
hello I'm Chris shuttle certified,27.52,5.31,32.83,surprise
and hyperbaric specialists in this video,30.46,4.02,34.480000000000004,surprise
I'll be demonstrating how to apply the,32.83,3.99,36.82,surprise
snap bridge dressing on a diabetic foot,34.48,4.56,39.04,surprise
ulcer when treating a chronic wound on,36.82,4.5,41.32,surprise
the plantar surface of the foot it's,39.04,4.71,43.75,
sometimes beneficial to use a dressing,41.32,4.74,46.06,
that positions support and the tubing,43.75,4.559,48.309,
away from the wound to minimize the,46.06,4.52,50.58,
chance of additional pressure points as,48.309,5.25,53.559,
you can see here this patient has a,50.58,5.14,55.72,
diabetic foot ulcer on the base of the,53.559,4.381,57.94,happy
foot since it's a low extra dating wound,55.72,4.83,60.55,
the snap bridge dressing is a good,57.94,4.38,62.32,
choice for delivering negative pressure,60.55,3.48,64.03,
wound therapy let's see how to,62.32,4.11,66.43,
effectively apply this dressing to,64.03,6.18,70.21000000000001,
ensure a secure protective seal in this,66.43,6.03,72.46000000000001,
challenging area begin by preparing the,70.21,4.049,74.259,
wound bed and parry wound skin,72.46,4.11,76.57,happy
according to institutional protocols if,74.259,5.25,79.509,happy
necessary apply a skin protectant to the,76.57,5.82,82.38999999999999,happy
surrounding skin next cut the blue foam,79.509,4.531,84.04,happy
to fit the size and shape of the wound,82.39,3.479,85.869,
place the foam into the wound cavity,84.04,3.84,87.88000000000001,
making sure it fills the cavity without,85.869,4.201,90.07,
stuffing the foam into the cavity and,87.88,3.989,91.869,
extends above the warm margins,90.07,3.45,93.52,
since this wound is on the plantar,91.869,3.661,95.53,
surface of the foot we want to minimize,93.52,4.41,97.92999999999999,
the chance of additional pressure points,95.53,4.589,100.119,
the dressing kit should be oriented so,97.93,4.35,102.28,
the bridge portion of the dressing lies,100.119,4.981,105.1,
flat on the foot and the port is located,102.28,5.25,107.53,
on a non weight-bearing surface to help,105.1,4.29,109.39,
create a seal you can use the snap,107.53,4.56,112.09,
secure ring hydrocolloid a sterile Motul,109.39,5.04,114.43,
ring designed to provide fast and easy,112.09,4.709,116.799,
sealing on uneven skin surfaces and,114.43,4.53,118.96000000000001,
challenging body contours shape the,116.799,4.591,121.39,
snaps secure ring hydrocolloid to fit,118.96,4.35,123.30999999999999,
around the outside of the patient's,121.39,4.14,125.53,
wound using light pressure apply the,123.31,4.709,128.019,
snaps secure bring hydrocolloid around,125.53,4.35,129.88,
the wound leave at least one centimeter,128.019,4.351,132.37,
of intact skin between the snap secure,129.88,4.65,134.53,
ring hydrocolloid and the wound margin,132.37,4.2,136.57,
now we're ready to begin application of,134.53,4.32,138.85,
the snap bridge dressing kit slowly peel,136.57,4.35,140.92,
away the center release liner place the,138.85,4.74,143.59,
snap dressing over the wound to maintain,140.92,4.47,145.39,
a proper seal the dressings should be,143.59,4.2,147.79,
adhere to at least one centimeter of,145.39,4.68,150.07,
intact skin gently smooth out the,147.79,3.99,151.78,
hydrocolloid dressing to remove any,150.07,4.02,154.09,
