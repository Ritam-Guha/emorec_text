Welcome back to lecture 20.,33.35,2.75,36.1,
"On Thursday, we have a special
guest appearance just for you",36.1,4.8,40.9,
from Professor Ron Weiss.,40.9,1.36,42.26,
"He's going to be talking
about synthetic biology.",42.26,2.842,45.102,
"You know, on Richard
Feynman's blackboard,",45.102,3.118,48.22,
"when he died, was a little
statement I've always",48.22,3.3,51.519999999999996,
"really enjoyed that was actually
encased in a little chalk line.",51.52,3.82,55.34,
"And it said, ""What I cannot
create, I do not understand.""",55.34,3.48,58.82,
"And so synthetic
biology is one way",58.82,2.4,61.22,
"to approach questions in
the biological sciences",61.22,2.807,64.027,neutral

can make-- you know,",64.027,1.583,65.61,neutral
"whole organisms, new
genomes, rewiring circuitry.",65.61,3.179,68.789,
"So I think you'll find it to be
a very interesting discussion",68.789,2.541,71.33,
on Thursday.,71.33,1.39,72.72,neutral
"But first, before we talk
about synthetic biology,",72.72,3.45,76.17,
"we have the very
exciting discussion today",76.17,3.13,79.3,
"on human genetics, which of
course concerns all of us.",79.3,2.85,82.14999999999999,
"And so we're going to
have an exploration today.",82.15,2.52,84.67,
"And you know, as I
prepared today's lecture,",84.67,2.68,87.35000000000001,
"I wanted to give you the latest
and greatest research findings.",87.35,3.76,91.11,
"So we're going to talk today
from fundamental techniques",91.11,2.8,93.91,neutral
"to things that are very
controversial that have caused",93.91,3.65,97.56,
"fistfights in bars, so
I'm hopeful that you'll",97.56,2.74,100.3,
"be as engaged as the
people drinking beer are.",100.3,3.01,103.31,
"So we'll be turning to that
at the end of the lecture,",103.31,2.96,106.27,
"but first I wanted to tell you
about the broad narrative arc",106.27,5.54,111.81,
"once again that we're going
to be talking about today.",111.81,2.42,114.23,
"And we're going to
be looking at how",114.23,2.28,116.51,
to discover human variation.,116.51,2.49,119.0,
"We're all different, about
1 based in every 1,000.",119.0,3.45,122.45,

broad approaches historically",122.45,4.47,126.92,

discovering variants,",128.639,2.177,130.816,

how those were designed.",130.816,1.874,132.69,
"And we'll talk about
how to actually test",132.69,2.236,134.926,
"for the significance
of human variation",134.926,1.624,136.54999999999998,

to use whole genome read data",140.89,4.64,145.52999999999997,
"to detect variation
between humans",145.53,2.22,147.75,
"and some of the
challenges in that,",147.75,1.86,149.61,
"because it does not
make as many assumptions",149.61,3.26,152.87,
"as the microarray studies,
and therefore is much, much",152.87,4.36,157.23000000000002,
more complicated to process.,157.23,1.99,159.22,
"And so we're going to
take a view into the best",159.22,2.71,161.93,
"practices of processing
human read data",161.93,3.35,165.28,
"so you can understand what
the state of the art is.",165.28,2.72,168.0,
"And then we're going to
turn to a study showing",168.0,3.45,171.45,
"how we can bring together
different threads we've",171.45,2.64,174.08999999999997,
talked about in this subject.,174.09,3.08,177.17000000000002,
"In particular, we've
talked about the idea",177.17,2.27,179.44,

signals such as histone marks",179.44,4.65,184.09,
"to identify things like
regulatory elements.",184.09,2.77,186.86,
"So we're going to talk about
how we can take that lens",186.86,3.61,190.47000000000003,
"and focus it on the
genome to discover",190.47,2.14,192.60999999999999,
"particular genomic variants that
have been revealed to be very",192.61,5.16,197.77,
"important in a
particular disease.",197.77,3.93,201.70000000000002,
"And finally, we'll
talk about the idea",201.7,2.8,204.5,
"that what-- the beginning
we're going to talk about today",204.5,2.4,206.9,
is all about correlation.,206.9,3.05,209.95000000000002,
"And as all of you go forward
in your scientific career,",209.95,4.33,214.28,

be careful to not confuse",214.28,3.89,218.17,
"association or correlation
with causation.",218.17,4.46,222.63,
"You're always respected
when you clearly",222.63,1.794,224.424,
"articulate the difference when
you're giving a talk saying",224.424,2.416,226.84,
"that this is correlated,
but we don't necessarily",226.84,2.83,229.67000000000002,
"know it's causative until we do
the right set of experiments.",229.67,4.82,234.48999999999998,
"OK, on that note, we'll turn
to the computational approaches",234.49,5.427,239.917,
we're going to talk about.,239.917,1.083,241.0,
"We'll talk about contingency
tables and various ways",241.0,2.92,243.92,
"of thinking about
them when we discuss",243.92,3.29,247.20999999999998,
"how to identify whether or not
a particular SNP is associated",247.21,4.5,251.71,
"with a disease using
various kinds of tests.",251.71,4.79,256.5,
"And then we talk
about read data,",256.5,1.769,258.269,
"and we'll talk about
likelihood based tests.",258.269,2.901,261.17,
"How to do things like
take a population",261.17,2.66,263.83000000000004,
"of individuals and
their read data",263.83,1.71,265.53999999999996,
"and estimate the
genotypic frequencies",265.54,2.36,267.90000000000003,

"in toto using EM
based techniques.",270.41,3.25,273.66,
OK?,273.66,1.01,274.67,
So let us begin then.,274.67,2.07,276.74,
"Some of the things we're
not going to talk about",279.3,2.0,281.3,
"include non-random
genotyping failure,",281.3,4.17,285.47,
"methods to correct for
population stratification,",285.47,2.94,288.41,
"and structural variants
and copy number variations.",288.41,3.47,291.88000000000005,
"Point three we'll
just briefly touch on,",291.88,2.6,294.48,
"but fundamentally they're
just embellishments",294.48,3.43,297.91,
"on the fundamental techniques
we're talking about,",297.91,2.45,300.36,
"and so I didn't really want
to confuse today's discussion.",300.36,5.81,306.17,
"Now a Mendelian
disorder is a disorder",306.17,5.13,311.3,
"defined by a single gene,
and therefore, they're",311.3,5.95,317.25,
relatively easy to map.,317.25,2.68,319.93,
"And they also tend to
be in low frequency",319.93,3.13,323.06,
"in the population because
they're selected against,",323.06,3.16,326.22,
"especially the more severe
Mendelian disorders.",326.22,3.07,329.29,
"And therefore, they correspond
to very rare mutations",329.29,2.92,332.21000000000004,
in the population.,332.21,2.89,335.09999999999997,
"By point of contrast, if you
thought about the genetics",335.1,3.36,338.46000000000004,
"we discussed last
time, if you think",338.46,2.342,340.80199999999996,
"about a trait that
actually perhaps",340.802,1.458,342.26000000000005,
"is influenced by 200 genes and
maybe that one of those genes",342.26,5.15,347.40999999999997,
"is not necessary or sufficient
for a particular disease.",347.41,3.73,351.14000000000004,
"As a consequence, it could
be a fairly common variant",351.14,3.2,354.34,
"and it's only if you're unlucky
enough to get all the other 199",354.34,3.69,358.03,
"variants will you actually
come down with that syndrome.",358.03,3.69,361.71999999999997,
"And therefore, you can see
that the effect of variation",361.72,3.66,365.38000000000005,
"in the human genome
is inversely related",365.38,2.83,368.21,
"to its frequency-- that
fairly rare variants can have",368.21,4.45,372.65999999999997,
"very serious effects, whereas
fairly common variants tend",372.66,4.33,376.99,
to have fewer effects.,376.99,3.23,380.22,
"And in the first phase of
mapping human variation,",380.22,3.14,383.36,
"people thought that
common variants",383.36,1.76,385.12,
"were things that had
an allelic frequency",385.12,1.91,387.03000000000003,
"in the population
of 5% or greater.",387.03,3.95,390.97999999999996,
"And then to burrow down deeper,
the 1000 Genomes Project",390.98,3.96,394.94,
"surveyed a collection of
different populations.",394.94,3.28,398.21999999999997,
"And therefore, if you
thought that a variant was",398.22,3.71,401.93,
"prevalent in the
population at frequency",401.93,1.87,403.8,
"of 0.5%, how many people
would have in the 1000 Genomes",403.8,3.04,406.84000000000003,

we're phase-locked here.",411.7,3.44,415.14,

"PROFESSOR: 5, great.",418.13,0.97,419.1,
OK.,419.1,0.97,420.07000000000005,
Good.,420.07,1.86,421.93,
"Now of course, these are three
different populations or more,",421.93,2.6,424.53000000000003,
"and so it might be that,
in fact, that variant's",424.53,2.9,427.42999999999995,
"only present in one
of the population.",427.43,1.69,429.12,
"So it just might be
one or two people",429.12,1.541,430.661,sad
"that actually have a
particular variant.",430.661,2.509,433.17,
"So the idea is that the way that
you design SNP chips to detect",433.17,6.15,439.32,
"single nucleotide polymorphisms,
otherwise known as ""SNPs,""",439.32,4.11,443.43,
"is that you do these
population-based sequencing",443.43,2.68,446.11,
"studies and you
design the array based",446.11,3.68,449.79,neutral
"upon all of the common
variants that you find, OK?",449.79,5.09,454.88,
"And therefore, the array
gives you a direct readout",454.88,2.42,457.3,

variation, in terms",457.3,1.49,458.79,neutral
of all of these common variants.,458.79,2.13,460.92,neutral
That's where we'll start today.,460.92,1.89,462.81,
"And where we'll end today is
sequencing based approaches,",462.81,3.73,466.54,
"which make no assumptions
whatsoever and just all hell",466.54,4.26,470.8,
breaks loose.,470.8,1.51,472.31,
"So you'll see what happens, OK?",472.31,2.33,474.64,
"But I wanted just to
reinforce the idea",474.64,2.41,477.05,
"that there are different
allelic frequencies of variants",477.05,3.92,480.97,
"and that as we get down to
rarer and rarer alleles, right,",480.97,4.66,485.63000000000005,
we have larger effects.,485.63,2.04,487.67,
"But these higher
frequency alleles",487.67,1.63,489.3,
"could also have effects even
though they're much smaller.",489.3,5.51,494.81,
"OK, so let's talk about
how these variants arise",494.81,4.68,499.49,
"and what they mean in terms
of a small little cartoon.",499.49,5.24,504.73,
"So long, long ago,
in a world far,",504.73,3.31,508.04,
"far away, a mutation
occurred where",508.04,3.89,511.93,
"a base G got mutated
to a base A, OK?",511.93,5.05,516.98,

what happens is",529.86,2.5,532.36,

"Yes, I do tell
stories at night, too.",541.34,3.46,544.8000000000001,

mutation occurred.",544.8,7.49,552.29,neutral

some subset of those people",552.29,3.37,555.66,neutral

them to get the disease.",555.66,3.07,558.73,neutral

what the authors of this study",4454.07,6.2,4460.2699999999995,

elucidated the motifs",4496.29,2.59,4498.88,

one's always going to get it.",4563.15,4.03,4567.179999999999,
