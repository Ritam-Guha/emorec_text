about synthetic biology,",72.72,3.45,76.17,NA

course concerns all of us.",79.3,2.85,82.14999999999999,NA

make as many assumptions",149.61,3.26,152.87,NA

how we can take that lens",186.86,3.61,190.47000000000003,NA

we're talking about,",297.91,2.45,300.36,NA

to confuse today's discussion.",300.36,5.81,306.17,NA
"Now a Mendelian
disorder is a disorder",306.17,5.13,311.3,NA

thought about the genetics",335.1,3.36,338.46000000000004,NA

time, if you think",338.46,2.342,340.80199999999996,NA

actually perhaps",340.802,1.458,342.26000000000005,NA

come down with that syndrome.",358.03,3.69,361.71999999999997,NA

common variants",383.36,1.76,385.12,NA

reinforce the idea",474.64,2.41,477.05,NA
