what happens is",511.93,17.295,529.225,NA

mutation occurred.",532.36,17.02,549.38,NA

some subset of those people to get the mutation and for
them to get the disease. So the original mutation was
not sufficient for people to get this genetic disease. It required a second

that we know is that, in this particular

don't have this mutation.",567.6,14.413,582.013,NA

mutation is not necessary. It's neither necessary

risk without being",586.75,18.009999999999998,604.76,NA

SNP, rs1061170. There are the individuals

number of individuals. And the question is,
are the C and T alleles associated with the cases

a Chi-square metric",728.36,19.31,747.67,NA

contingency table. And one of the things
about contingency tables that I think is
important to point out is that you hear about

idea of these margins along the side of a
contingency table, right? If you think about the marginal

the Chi-square statistic is shown here. It's this sort of

Chi-square statistics-- I'm sure people have seen this
before-- the usual formulation is that you compute this

expected number of something",816.53,18.34,834.87,NA

number or something, right? And you sum it up over

formula on the left. Suffice to say, if you expand
that formula and manipulate it,",834.87,16.51,851.38,NA

you digest that for one second before I go on. So this is the number of ways

you-- how much of your genome came from your dad? Half. How much came from
your dad's dad? AUDIENCE: A quarter.",1574.87,7.386,1582.2559999999999,NA

your dad's dad's dad? AUDIENCE: An eighth. PROFESSOR: An eighth, OK? So the amount of your genome

of things that came together from your great,
great grandfather or his great, great

going to be smaller-- that is, the amount
of information you're getting from
way back up the tree. So if you think about
this, the question of what blocks of things
are inherited together",1607.7,14.87,1622.57,NA

can write an equation for. It's something that you
study in a population. You go out and you

in more recent generations, because there's less

back in time-- not quite to where the dinosaurs

blocks are, fact, quite small.",1635.34,14.38,1649.72,NA

went about looking at blocks and how they were
inherited in the genome. And what suffices to know is
that they found blocks-- here you can see three
different blocks. And these are called
haplotype blocks",1649.72,18.73,1668.45,NA

particular example,",1678.6,12.92,1691.52,NA

specified markers which are not necessarily at regular
intervals along the genome. So in this case, the blocks

sequencing-based approaches, they could have
fuzzier boundaries.",1691.52,14.06,1705.58,NA

upon the idea that this is empirical, right? There's no magic here in

be haplotype blocks. It's simply that you
look at a population",1717.35,14.2,1731.55,NA

markers are drinking buddies and those make haplotype blocks

about studying a family, like a trio-- a trio is a mom,

to be very large indeed.",1750.99,14.399999999999999,1765.39,NA

back generations, the blocks-- like the
second cousins or things like that-- the

study, which is taking random people
out of the population, has very small shared
blocks indeed, OK? And so the techniques
that we're talking about today are applicable
almost in any range,",1778.48,14.55,1793.03,NA

going to get a higher risk of having a
genetic disorder. So when you're scanning down
the genome then-- you know, we've been asking where
are there differences from reference or from
between cases and controls",1986.68,17.759999999999998,2004.44,NA

haven't asked whether or not they're on mom or dad, right? We're just asking,

not the mutation occurred",2004.44,17.415,2021.855,NA

placing the variants on a particular chromosome.",2024.55,20.79,2045.34,NA

little suspicious",2663.16,15.650000000000002,2678.81,NA

a seven-base pair homopolymer which is all T's. And as we know,

how to do that. Now everything I've written on

slide in a moment, OK? But here's the fundamental
idea, all right? At a given base in the
genome, the probability of the reads that we see based
upon the genotype that we think is there can be expressed

all the reads that we see, OK? And the genotype is going to

aside for a moment.",3168.55,20.24,3188.79,NA

the probability of the genotype given the reads that
we have in our hand. This is really important.",3383.27,18.55,3401.82,NA

an individual now, we can compute the

probability that that's correct",3451.17,23.729999999999997,3474.9,NA

we haven't discussed is this prior,

at the slide again,",3495.03,16.93,3511.96,NA

have these individuals and there's this magic step

testing for that because we're actually estimating

I'm doing my test? Well, here's the issue.",3812.95,13.759999999999998,3826.71,NA

to be testing whether or not genotypes are different

different tests you can do. The first test is
the test on the top",3826.71,18.07,3844.78,NA

the test on the bottom. Let's look at the test on
the bottom for a moment, OK? The test in the bottom

the data in group one and group two

data with the groups combined and you ask whether or not the
increased likelihood-- you're willing to pay for that given
the two degrees of freedom that model implies, right? Because you have to have two
additional degrees of freedom",3859.29,28.5,3887.79,NA

in the top, you only have one degree of
additional freedom to pay for the difference in
simply the reference allele frequency.",3887.79,12.257,3900.047,NA

different metrics you can use to test
for associations for a particular SNP in two
different case and control populations. The problem comes is that if the
population is in equilibrium,",3900.047,14.242999999999999,3914.29,NA

degrees of freedom, right? Because the bottom,
in some sense, can be computed
directly from the top. You can compute the epsilons
directly from the size if it's in equilibrium.",3914.29,13.129999999999999,3927.42,NA

know whether or not you're in equilibrium or not
to figure out what kind of test to use to see whether or not a
particular SNP is significant. OK, so just a brief review where
we've come to at this point. I've handed you a
basket of reads.",3927.42,15.615,3943.035,NA

location in the genome. For an individual, we can
look at that basket of reads and compute a posterior

all of the individuals",3946.22,14.67,3960.89,NA

population, like the cases, we could compute the
posterior or the probability of the genotype over
all those cases. We then can take the
cases and the controls and test for associations using
this likelihood ratio, OK?",3960.89,18.97,3979.8599999999997,NA
"So that is the way to go
at the question of SNPs. And I'll pause here
and see if there any other questions about this. OK, now there are
lots of other ways of approaching
structural variation.",3979.86,16.509,3996.369,NA

method which is-- we've not been here assigning
what haplotypes to things or paying attention to
which chromosome or mom or dad a particularly
allele came from.",4001.64,16.78,4018.42,NA
"But suffice to
say-- I'll let you read this slide
at your leisure-- the key thing is that, imagine
you have a bunch of reads. What you can do in
a particular area there's going to
be a variant is you",4018.42,11.81,4030.23,NA
"can do local assembly
of the reads. We want to do local assembly
because local assembly handles general cases of
structural variation. And if you then take
the most likely cases of the local assembly
supported by reads,",4030.23,15.57,4045.8,NA
"you have the different possible
haplotypes or collections of bases along the
genome from the assembly. And we've already talked
about, earlier in class, how to take a given
sequence of bases and estimate the probability
of the divergence",4048.36,17.94,4066.3,NA

the divergence of each one of those
assemblies from the reference and compute likelihoods, like
we did before for single bases, although it's
somewhat more complex.",4066.3,12.89,4079.19,NA

to approach this is, instead of asking
about individual bases and looking at the likelihood
of individual bases, you can look at doing
localized assembly of the reads that handle
structural variation.",4079.19,15.38,4094.57,NA

what happens is that you can recover
INDEL issues that appear to call SNP variants that
actually are actually induced by insertions and deletions

get more sophisticated",4097.49,33.02,4130.51,NA

human genome data, one needs a variety
of techniques, including local assembly,

the reference genome",4130.51,9.719000000000001,4140.229,NA

idea of what's there and is being
used as a scaffold. So we've already talked

recover whether or not",4140.229,22.25,4162.479,NA

function event, right? And so the phasing

because we could talk about phasing for
an entire lecture. But suffice it to
say, it's important. And if you look at

bottom, you see mom's reads. And you see dad actually

number one from mom. So you can see how these
blocks of mutations are inherited through the
generation in this form. And finally, if you
look at a VCF file, if you see a
vertical bar, that's",4209.41,23.869999999999997,4233.28,NA

chromosomal origin is fixed. So it tells you, for

arrow's pointed to is that variant
number one, which is the alternative
variant T came from mom",4236.14,16.54,4252.68,NA

slashes between the two different alleles of a
genotype is unphased, but you can actually have
a phased VCF version. And so there's a whole
phase in the GATK tool kit",4252.68,19.82,4272.5,NA

through all this, the question is how important
are the variants you discover? And so there's a

annotate all the variants.",4272.5,15.659999999999998,4288.16,NA

splice site acceptor variant which is in a
protein coating gene and it's thought
to be important. And so at the end

happen is you're going",4288.16,14.533,4302.693,NA

only the variants but, for some of them, what
their annotated function is. OK, so that ends the

little red square is. And recall that we said that
certain histone marks were present typically

red box as well as",4389.34,15.69,4405.03,NA

regulators, FoxA2 and Pdx1. And within that
enhancer you can see there are a whole lot of
variants being called. Well, not a whole lot. There are actually
five different variants",4405.03,11.66,4416.69,NA

five specific SNP variants, there's also another
variation that was observed in the population of a 7.6-kb
deletion right around that enhancer.",4416.69,12.45,4429.139999999999,NA

inheritance of those mutations with disease
prevalence, you can see that there's a very
marked correlation. That when you inherit
these variants, you get this Mendelian disorder.",4429.14,20.31,4449.450000000001,NA

gene disorder really. And in order to confirm this,
what the authors of this study did was they took
that enhancer and they looked at all the different
SNPs and they mutated it. And in the upper
left-hand corner,",4449.45,18.51,4467.96,NA
