Good morning.,37.989,2.0,39.989,

It's just,52.51,2.0,54.51,neutral
I fell asleep around 10:00. Woke up around 11:30. Just really violently sick,55.12,6.799,61.919,neutral
and vomiting and vomiting and vomiting and,62.68,2.0,64.68,neutral
"Eventually it settled down, and I was able to push an IV zofran through my port to help with the nausea.",65.229,5.57,70.799,neutral
But it did not work. I was just so,70.8,2.0,72.8,neutral
severe that vomiting stuff.,73.3,2.0,75.3,neutral
"And eventually I managed to go back to sleep, but I was up again around 1 and then again around 3",75.729,6.65,82.379,neutral
"and that third time Judd had come home from work,",83.02,3.44,86.46,neutral
and he pushed an IV zofran for me because I couldn't even get up off the floor and,87.039,4.28,91.319,neutral
Finally after that I was able to go to sleep for the night.,93.6,3.36,96.96,neutral
I mean that is gastroparesis for ya.Sometimes it's really hard. I have like,98.56,5.52,104.08,neutral
these nightly,104.979,1.71,106.689,neutral
"vomiting episodes like 2 or 3 times a week, but last night was way more severe than usual",106.689,6.59,113.279,neutral

"yeah, sometimes you can do everything right, but everything can still go wrong because",126.07,5.81,131.88,neutral
chronic illness isn't always fair.,133.18,2.0,135.18,neutral
"Sorry, I'm just feeling pretty.... pretty terrible so I'm gonna",135.7,3.62,139.32,neutral
try and get my nausea here under control a little more and then,140.17,2.75,142.92,neutral
go back to bed,143.71,1.32,145.03,neutral
I'm feeling a little bit more alive. Part of my treatment for gastroparesis is doing infusions three times a week.,145.03,7.19,152.22,neutral
Originally the infusions were started only for my postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.,152.74,4.699,157.43900000000002,neutral
"To increase blood volume and help with fainting and things like that, but when my GP got a lot worse",158.02,5.599,163.619,neutral
we started mixing one of my infusion bags into banana bags. And that's extra vitamins and nutrients and minerals to help supplement,163.9,7.1,171.0,neutral
whatever my feeding Tube formula doesn't give me and the fluids themselves helped a lot with the,171.0,5.07,176.07,neutral
dehydration that comes with also vomiting from my GP.,176.26,2.75,179.01,neutral
"And so because of the infusions and other things like IV zofran, an anti-nausea med I can administer through my port intravenously,",179.53,7.76,187.29,
we can manage my gastroparesis more at home now.,187.9,3.38,191.28,neutral

"Alright, I pushed an IV zofran, started my saline infusion. When that infusion bag's done",198.0,4.76,202.76,fear
I will do my banana bag and now,202.769,2.07,204.839,fear
I'm gotta take care of my feeding tube.,205.14,1.72,206.85999999999999,fear
My feeding tube pump is actually off. And I didn't get much,207.36,3.56,210.92000000000002,
nutrition last night at all. That's because when I'm having a lot of nausea and vomiting the,210.96,4.76,215.72,
"feeds can make it worse, so I had to turn it off to give myself a break.",216.13,3.919,220.049,
But hopefully when the zofran really kicks in. Then I can start it up at... at least a low rate,220.049,6.75,226.799,
"But I still need to flush my feeding tube, so I'm going to do that now",227.2,3.42,230.61999999999998,neutral
By the way when I'm like this Harlow is always very close to me. You're like my furry Shadow.,240.96,4.96,245.92000000000002,
"I made it downstairs, and if you're wondering why I'm on the floor,",247.53,4.279,251.809,neutral
"this is why. She gets really clingy and concerned when I'm not doing... when I'm doing extra poorly, so",252.54,6.289,258.829,neutral
I love my dog.,259.62,1.739,261.359,
"Anyways, I called my doctor, and we think a big problem is that I'm not tolerating my feeds anymore, meaning this formula",261.359,6.56,267.919,neutral
just doesn't work well for my body anymore.,267.92,2.0,269.92,fear
"And when I first got my feeding tube, about 2 and 1/2 months ago, the hospital was very particular about what formula",270.11,6.63,276.74,neutral
"they put me on. And this was the best option at the time, but I've been doing some research,",276.74,4.32,281.06,neutral
"and there's other types of formulas that aren't really offered everywhere, only certain distributors have access to it. And some of them are like completely",281.06,7.42,288.48,neutral
"organic, no added preservatives,",288.6,2.04,290.64000000000004,happy

"wholesome ingredients. And this formula does give me a complete nutritious diet,",291.72,3.98,295.70000000000005,neutral
but,295.7,0.73,296.43,fear
some formulas are better than others and some will be better for my body than others. So I was talking to my doctor about switching.,296.43,5.72,302.15000000000003,fear
"And he's open to it, but he wants us supposed to do a little more research,",302.15,3.18,305.33,fear
which I'm totally okay with.,305.33,1.899,307.229,fear
It's just that I haven't been able to maintain my goal rate of 35 milliliters an hour and since I don't really do any oral,307.229,6.41,313.639,fear
intake at all.,313.64,0.85,314.49,angry
"I'm not getting enough nutrition, and that's not good, but if I try and bump up my rate to my goal, right?",314.49,5.57,320.06,fear
"I just get unbearable symptoms of cramping and nausea and vomiting and it's just, it's not good",320.06,6.179,326.239,fear
"The other thing is, well if you're new here. I have a J",326.729,3.77,330.49899999999997,neutral
"tube, feeding tube.",330.5,0.9,331.4,sad
So it completely skips my stomach and goes to my Jejunum for nutrition.,331.4,4.019,335.419,happy
Because of my GP my stomach is the most problematic part of my digestive tract. It is just is partially paralyzed,335.52,5.899,341.419,fear
"and it just doesn't digest anything well at all. And,",341.419,2.76,344.179,fear
this feeding tube doesn't have a G port. The new feeding tube I'm getting is a GJ button.,344.76,4.909,349.669,neutral
It'll have the J port for nutrition and a G port to my stomach to allow me to vent and drain contents,349.669,5.76,355.429,fear
that are just sitting there because my stomach can't digest it.,355.43,2.82,358.25,neutral
And it doesn't matter if I eat or not.,358.25,1.57,359.82,neutral
"Because even if I don't eat, there's a lot of like, pressure build-up and bile and acid that my stomach can't handle either. So that",359.82,5.809,365.629,neutral
venting and draining option is going to be a really good tool in my treatment.,365.729,4.52,370.24899999999997,fear
And they found out they can overnight the GJ button,370.7,3.089,373.789,fear
and they're ordering a few different sizes so I leave with the right fit.,373.79,3.66,377.45000000000005,fear
"And they got me in to change it on the 18th, and that's a lot sooner than we expected,",377.67,4.82,382.49,neutral
but everyone feels so bad about what happened. They're working really hard to fix it,382.49,3.149,385.639,fear
"Which is okay with me, and I'm also on top of them a bit. So between changing my formula and getting the new feeding tube",385.64,7.079,392.719,fear
I think we'll be able to better manage my symptoms.,392.72,2.72,395.44000000000005,fear
"Well, I managed to get my rate up to 15 milliliters an hour, but that's even making my nausea worse",395.6,6.8,402.40000000000003,neutral

chicken noodle soup.,416.07,1.62,417.69,
So,417.69,1.23,418.92,
Doing it in the slow cooker. I don't have a recipe. It's just a bunch of stuff I throw together.,418.92,3.679,422.599,neutral

Judd didn't even wake me up when he went to work,470.92,1.94,472.86,fear

It tastes good.,638.08,0.98,639.0600000000001,neutral
