hi everybody and welcome back to my,0.06,4.56,4.619999999999999,fear
channel so as you may have guessed from,2.129,4.431,6.5600000000000005,sad
the title this video is all about the,4.62,5.399,10.019,sad
GPP test which I have now had twice,6.56,8.56,15.120000000000001,sad
Yemi the GTP test is the glucose,10.019,9.031,19.05,sad
tolerance test you could be sent for,15.12,6.84,21.96,sad
this test by your midwife for so many,19.05,5.91,24.96,sad
different reasons reasons it could be,21.96,5.069,27.029,sad
because of your BMI it could be because,24.96,4.29,29.25,sad
of your medical history it could be,27.029,4.801,31.83,sad
because of your family medical history,29.25,4.53,33.78,sad
it could be because you are measuring,31.83,4.86,36.69,sad
big and there are other reasons as well,33.78,4.59,38.370000000000005,sad
those are just the ones I can think of,36.69,4.17,40.86,sad
off the top of my head the reason I have,38.37,5.7,44.07,sad
it the first time is because my BMI was,40.86,5.73,46.59,sad
a point nine over what they wanted it to,44.07,5.16,49.230000000000004,sad
be and so I had to go and have the best,46.59,4.71,51.300000000000004,sad
done so basically it takes probably,49.23,4.02,53.25,sad
about two and a half hours I'd say,51.3,5.13,56.43,sad
depending on your hospital or your,53.25,5.039,58.289,sad
practice or wherever you go for the test,56.43,5.58,62.01,sad
so you go in and you have your first lot,58.289,6.15,64.43900000000001,sad
of blood taken mine were taken just from,62.01,5.37,67.38,sad
here on my arm and these are your,64.439,6.36,70.79899999999999,sad
fasting blood results because you are,67.38,4.77,72.14999999999999,sad
not allowed to eat or drink anything,70.799,3.961,74.76,sad
other than water for 12 hours before,72.15,5.94,78.09,sad
that and even things like toothpaste you,74.76,5.52,80.28,sad
have to be so careful make sure that you,78.09,3.54,81.63000000000001,sad
don't swallow any or anything like that,80.28,3.06,83.34,sad
because it can affect the results which,81.63,6.09,87.72,sad
would not be good then you are given a,83.34,6.72,90.06,sad
glucose drink to drink,87.72,6.06,93.78,sad
now some people I have heard say that,90.06,5.64,95.7,sad
they were told to take lucozade with,93.78,6.78,100.56,sad
them to drink or that their drink tasted,95.7,7.559,103.259,sad
like flat dizzy and things like that I,100.56,5.4,105.96000000000001,sad
have to say my drink tasted like neither,103.259,5.761,109.02,sad
of those it literally just tasted gloopy,105.96,7.68,113.63999999999999,sad
and it just tasted wrong like it,109.02,5.849,114.869,sad
shouldn't have been a drink because,113.64,3.299,116.93900000000001,sad
obviously it was a medical drink and not,114.869,4.651,119.52,sad
actual drink and so you have to drink,116.939,3.18,120.119,sad
that up,119.52,3.69,123.21,sad
preferably quite quickly because then,120.119,5.911,126.03,sad
your two hours between the two Burtis is,123.21,4.68,127.88999999999999,sad
quite sort of like done but your two,126.03,3.72,129.75,sad
hour slot will not start until you have,127.89,4.17,132.06,sad
finished drinking that drink so down it,129.75,5.67,135.42,sad
ladies I managed to drink wine probably,132.06,5.1,137.16,sad
in less than a minute because I just,135.42,4.319,139.73899999999998,sad
thought let's just go for it Blagh Blagh,137.16,3.06,140.22,sad
Blagh,139.739,3.841,143.58,sad
and drunk it and then it was gone you,140.22,5.67,145.89,sad
are still allowed to drink water then,143.58,4.5,148.08,sad
and because of a sea you need to hydrate,145.89,4.319,150.20899999999997,sad
these and things like that you wait two,148.08,4.71,152.79000000000002,sad
hours and then they take another lot of,150.209,4.291,154.5,sad
blood mine that was actually from the,152.79,3.84,156.63,sad
same arm because nobody can ever get,154.5,3.66,158.16,sad
blood from this arm for some reason and,156.63,3.78,160.41,sad
so they take your second lot of blood,158.16,5.43,163.59,sad
and they basically see how your body has,160.41,5.909,166.319,sad
reacted to the glucose whether it's done,163.59,4.17,167.76,sad
what it's supposed to you whether it's,166.319,2.851,169.17,sad
struggling and things like where and,167.76,3.03,170.79,sad
they do that by checking the levels in,169.17,3.569,172.73899999999998,sad
your blood after you have done the,170.79,5.6,176.39,sad
second blood test if you are lucky I do,172.739,7.11,179.84900000000002,sad
sort of like use the word lucky and your,176.39,5.5,181.89,sad
midwife or whoever is doing the tests,179.849,3.901,183.75,fear
may offer you some tea and toast,181.89,4.83,186.72,fear
feel free to accept personally I did it,183.75,5.01,188.76,sad
because I was in a rush but you know it,186.72,3.629,190.349,sad
would have been nice to have have some,188.76,2.88,191.64,sad
breakfast because obviously you haven't,190.349,4.021,194.36999999999998,sad
eaten for like nearly 15 hours by this,191.64,6.569,198.20899999999997,sad
point so you're poor be hungry and our,194.37,6.63,201.0,sad
Hospital tells you to bring up the next,198.209,4.801,203.01,sad
day for the results I don't know some,201.0,4.44,205.44,sad
other places may give you them quicker,203.01,4.89,207.89999999999998,sad
or slower it all depends on how they,205.44,6.51,211.95,sad
work how their systems work how long it,207.9,6.45,214.35,sad
takes for them to do things and then the,211.95,4.89,216.83999999999997,sad
second time I have to have the test was,214.35,4.44,218.79,sad
because my beautiful bump all the way,216.84,4.17,221.01,sad
down here which you can't see and was,218.79,6.36,225.15,sad
measuring ahead so I went for my 28th,221.01,6.96,227.97,sad
week Midwife appointment but my body was,225.15,4.77,229.92000000000002,sad
measuring as if I was 30 weeks pregnant,227.97,6.09,234.06,sad
and then when I went for my 34 weeks,229.92,4.8,234.72,sad
pointment,234.06,3.239,237.299,sad
I've only was measuring as if I was 37,234.72,4.079,238.799,sad
and a half weeks pregnant,237.299,4.111,241.41,sad
so if you are measuring big with a four,238.799,5.791,244.59,sad
week period like passing and you haven't,241.41,4.889,246.299,sad
sort like evened out or caught up or,244.59,3.57,248.16,sad
what have you then you will be sent to,246.299,5.401,251.70000000000002,sad
have the test again and I shouldn't be,248.16,6.449,254.609,sad
thanked to have it again now because,251.7,5.25,256.95,sad
I've obviously been sent for it they,254.609,3.87,258.479,sad
know that I haven't have it and or,256.95,6.51,263.46,sad
haven't got it and that I am just,258.479,6.241,264.71999999999997,sad
measuring big so,263.46,3.03,266.48999999999995,sad
hopefully anyway if I go central again I,264.72,4.65,269.37,sad
think I might cry and however if your,266.49,5.07,271.56,sad
results do come back positive then that,269.37,4.43,273.8,sad
does mean you have gestational diabetes,271.56,4.44,276.0,sad
which is not good,273.8,5.92,279.72,sad
really it can be controlled with diet,276.0,7.35,283.35,sad
and even medication in some cases to,279.72,5.4,285.12,sad
keep you and your baby nice and healthy,283.35,4.13,287.48,sad
and safe and growing at the right rate,285.12,4.92,290.04,sad
luckily for me I didn't actually find,287.48,4.0,291.48,sad
out too much information about that,290.04,3.36,293.40000000000003,sad
because my results both times came back,291.48,2.49,293.97,sad
okay,293.4,3.33,296.72999999999996,sad
and so if anybody else has had their,293.97,4.23,298.20000000000005,sad
results come back and they have had it,296.73,2.91,299.64000000000004,sad
and they have any advice please feel,298.2,2.58,300.78,sad
free to leave it in the comments for,299.64,2.64,302.28,sad
anybody else that's watching this if,300.78,3.54,304.32,sad
they need any advice or they're worried,302.28,3.33,305.60999999999996,sad
or anything like that it would be really,304.32,2.97,307.29,sad
good if you could share your experiences,305.61,4.32,309.93,sad
oh yeah basically it's pretty harmless,307.29,4.71,312.0,sad
the drink tastes disgusting unless,309.93,4.11,314.04,sad
you're lucky it seems and then you're,312.0,5.1,317.1,sad
okay and but it just takes a couple of,314.04,5.25,319.29,sad
hours and it's over in some ways and you,317.1,4.83,321.93,sad
find out whether you do or don't have,319.29,4.5,323.79,sad
gestational diabetes and whether you do,321.93,7.02,328.95,sad
or don't need to change things and yeah,323.79,8.129,331.91900000000004,sad
so that was my experience of the GTG,328.95,6.18,335.13,sad
test twice and I hope that you enjoyed,331.919,4.5,336.419,sad
this video I hope that you found it,335.13,3.15,338.28,sad
