hi everybody and welcome back to my channel so as you may have guessed from the title this video is all about the GPP test which I have now had twice Yemi the GTP test is the glucose,0.06,31.981,32.041000000000004,angry
tolerance test you could be sent for this test by your midwife for so many different reasons reasons it could be because of your BMI it could be because of your medical history it could be,15.12,26.909999999999997,42.029999999999994,angry
because of your family medical history it could be because you are measuring big and there are other reasons as well those are just the ones I can think of off the top of my head the reason I have,29.25,23.849999999999998,53.099999999999994,angry
it the first time is because my BMI was a point nine over what they wanted it to be and so I had to go and have the best done so basically it takes probably about two and a half hours I'd say,40.86,24.75,65.61,angry
depending on your hospital or your practice or wherever you go for the test so you go in and you have your first lot of blood taken mine were taken just from here on my arm and these are your,53.25,28.499,81.749,angry
fasting blood results because you are not allowed to eat or drink anything other than water for 12 hours before that and even things like toothpaste you have to be so careful make sure that you,67.38,23.730999999999998,91.11099999999999,angry
don't swallow any or anything like that because it can affect the results which would not be good then you are given a glucose drink to drink now some people I have heard say that,80.28,27.57,107.85,angry
they were told to take lucozade with them to drink or that their drink tasted like flat dizzy and things like that I have to say my drink tasted like neither of those it literally just tasted gloopy,93.78,33.18,126.96000000000001,angry
and it just tasted wrong like it shouldn't have been a drink because obviously it was a medical drink and not actual drink and so you have to drink that up,109.02,20.669,129.689,angry
preferably quite quickly because then your two hours between the two Burtis is quite sort of like done but your two hour slot will not start until you have finished drinking that drink so down it,120.119,24.151000000000003,144.27,angry
ladies I managed to drink wine probably in less than a minute because I just thought let's just go for it Blagh Blagh Blagh and drunk it and then it was gone you,132.06,21.990000000000002,154.05,angry
are still allowed to drink water then and because of a sea you need to hydrate these and things like that you wait two hours and then they take another lot of blood mine that was actually from the,143.58,21.66,165.24,angry
same arm because nobody can ever get blood from this arm for some reason and so they take your second lot of blood and they basically see how your body has reacted to the glucose whether it's done,154.5,22.948999999999998,177.449,angry
what it's supposed to you whether it's struggling and things like where and they do that by checking the levels in your blood after you have done the second blood test if you are lucky I do,166.319,22.16,188.47899999999998,angry
sort of like use the word lucky and your midwife or whoever is doing the tests may offer you some tea and toast feel free to accept personally I did it because I was in a rush but you know it,176.39,22.87,199.26,angry
would have been nice to have have some breakfast because obviously you haven't eaten for like nearly 15 hours by this point so you're poor be hungry and our Hospital tells you to bring up the next,188.76,24.900999999999996,213.661,angry
day for the results I don't know some other places may give you them quicker or slower it all depends on how they work how their systems work how long it takes for them to do things and then the,201.0,27.18,228.18,angry
second time I have to have the test was because my beautiful bump all the way down here which you can't see and was measuring ahead so I went for my 28th week Midwife appointment but my body was,214.35,26.7,241.04999999999998,angry
measuring as if I was 30 weeks pregnant and then when I went for my 34 weeks pointment I've only was measuring as if I was 37 and a half weeks pregnant,227.97,22.319000000000003,250.289,angry
so if you are measuring big with a four week period like passing and you haven't sort like evened out or caught up or what have you then you will be sent to have the test again and I shouldn't be,238.799,26.1,264.899,angry
thanked to have it again now because I've obviously been sent for it they know that I haven't have it and or haven't got it and that I am just measuring big so,251.7,24.901000000000003,276.601,angry
hopefully anyway if I go central again I think I might cry and however if your results do come back positive then that does mean you have gestational diabetes which is not good,264.72,24.509999999999998,289.23,angry
really it can be controlled with diet and even medication in some cases to keep you and your baby nice and healthy and safe and growing at the right rate luckily for me I didn't actually find,276.0,25.799999999999997,301.8,angry
out too much information about that because my results both times came back okay and so if anybody else has had their results come back and they have had it,290.04,16.32,306.36,sad
and they have any advice please feel free to leave it in the comments for anybody else that's watching this if they need any advice or they're worried or anything like that it would be really,298.2,15.060000000000002,313.26,sad
good if you could share your experiences oh yeah basically it's pretty harmless the drink tastes disgusting unless you're lucky it seems and then you're okay and but it just takes a couple of,305.61,23.490000000000002,329.1,angry
hours and it's over in some ways and you find out whether you do or don't have gestational diabetes and whether you do or don't need to change things and yeah so that was my experience of the GTG,317.1,30.659,347.759,angry
test twice and I hope that you enjoyed this video I hope that you found it informative a little helpful if you thought was something that you were looking for don't forget to hit thumbs,331.919,19.111,351.03,angry
