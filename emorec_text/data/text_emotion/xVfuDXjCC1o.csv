we're looking for glucose in the urine,23.67,3.449,27.119,neutral
because this could indicate gestational,25.019,4.26,29.278999999999996,neutral
diabetes and we're looking for protein,27.119,4.89,32.009,
which could indicate that the woman may,29.279,5.28,34.559,
be developing preeclampsia so you'll,32.009,4.431,36.44,
want to of course perform hand hygiene,34.559,4.471,39.03,
dawn some gloves you'll need the,36.44,4.9,41.339999999999996,
