now as you know the retina is the light,7.62,6.04,13.66,disgust
sensitive area at the back of the eye,11.02,6.12,17.14,disgust
contains rods and cones the,13.66,6.39,20.05,disgust
light-sensitive cells and these convert,17.14,5.25,22.39,disgust
the light impulse into an electrical,20.05,5.129,25.179000000000002,disgust
impulse which goes to the optic nerve,22.39,5.0,27.39,disgust
and onto the occipital lobe of the brain,25.179,5.58,30.759,
where it's interpreting this vision so,27.39,4.539,31.929000000000002,
here we have the retina at the back of,30.759,5.911,36.67,
the eye and as we know in diabetes part,31.929,7.77,39.699,
of the problem is that the capillaries,36.67,8.729,45.399,
get thicker basement membrane so there's,39.699,7.311,47.01,
a thickening of the basement membrane,45.399,5.581,50.980000000000004,
and as well as being thicker as we've,47.01,6.009,53.019,
said the basement membrane is more,50.98,7.109,58.089,
permeable so plasma fluid can leak out,53.019,9.09,62.108999999999995,
into the retina so the capillaries in,58.089,6.571,64.66,
the retina can become leaky and we can,62.109,6.751,68.86,
get exudate accumulating in areas of the,64.66,6.779,71.439,
retina and this can damage the very,68.86,6.149,75.009,
delicate light-sensitive cells as a,71.439,6.811,78.25,
result of the aging age but as the,75.009,7.711,82.72,
basement membranes become thicker the,78.25,7.14,85.39,
thick basement membrane kind of starts,82.72,6.899,89.619,
to close off the capillaries and as well,85.39,7.11,92.5,
as that it loses the pulsatile ability,89.619,5.341,94.96,
which evens out the blood flowing,92.5,5.549,98.049,
through to the tissue so what this means,94.96,5.04,100.0,
is you can start to get ischemic changes,98.049,5.1,103.149,
in the areas of the rest of this,100.0,5.159,105.159,
microscopic blood vessel would normally,103.149,5.79,108.93900000000001,
supply and as well as that you get,105.159,7.111,112.27000000000001,
trouble iteration of the endothelial,108.939,8.671,117.60999999999999,
cells inside the capillaries so you get,112.27,6.57,118.84,
thickening of the basement membrane,117.61,5.009,122.619,
pushing in you lose the ability to,118.84,6.48,125.32000000000001,
smooth out the blood flow and also the,122.619,5.401,128.02,
lumen of the pillory gets clogged up by,125.32,6.66,131.98,
a proliferation of vascular endothelial,128.02,6.99,135.01000000000002,
cells and this means that an area of the,131.98,3.43,135.41,
retina,135.01,3.87,138.88,
now is going to be ischemic and,135.41,7.26,142.67,
therefore hypoxia not hypoxic so that's,138.88,5.68,144.56,
bad that's bad for the retina as well so,142.67,3.51,146.17999999999998,
we're areas of every day and now we've,144.56,5.61,150.17000000000002,
got an area of hypoxic ischemia so,146.18,9.57,155.75,
that's bad but the hypoxia stimulates,150.17,7.8,157.97,
the development of new blood vessels as,155.75,5.52,161.27,
well so the hypoxia because there's in a,157.97,5.85,163.82,disgust
hypoxic area that stimulates new blood,161.27,8.43,169.70000000000002,
vessels to grow into the retina and you,163.82,7.14,170.95999999999998,
might think that that's good,169.7,3.09,172.79,
in fact descent in a sense it is good,170.96,4.08,175.04000000000002,
because blood can go in the new blood,172.79,5.16,177.95,
vessels to this area of the retina and,175.04,6.3,181.34,
carry oxygen and correct the hypoxia so,177.95,5.31,183.26,
that sounds good that the retinas kind,181.34,5.28,186.62,
of healed itself but the problem is,183.26,5.52,188.78,
these new blood vessels develop quickly,186.62,5.67,192.29,
and die of low quality the walls of,188.78,5.21,193.99,
these new blood vessels are quite,192.29,5.7,197.98999999999998,
friable and they burst so you can get,193.99,7.45,201.44,
bursting of these walls leading to areas,197.99,6.27,204.26000000000002,disgust
of blood leaking out into the retina and,201.44,6.51,207.95,disgust
of course this gives us a retinal,204.26,8.67,212.92999999999998,happy
hemorrhage then we get retinal,207.95,7.62,215.57,
hemorrhage and the presence of the blood,212.93,5.279,218.209,
lying over the retina will kill the,215.57,6.92,222.48999999999998,disgust
retinal cells in that area so we've got,218.209,7.021,225.23,disgust
exudates accumulating accumulating in,222.49,5.77,228.26000000000002,happy
the retina we've got hypoxia we've got,225.23,4.62,229.85,disgust
new blood vessels which are bursting,228.26,3.9,232.16,disgust
causing retinal hemorrhages so there's,229.85,4.58,234.43,disgust
quite a few insults to the retina here,232.16,4.73,236.89,disgust
so what are we going to do about this,234.43,4.93,239.36,
well again we need to keep the blood,236.89,5.2,242.08999999999997,
sugar down near physiological levels,239.36,5.19,244.55,NA
many trials have shown this that if you,242.09,5.27,247.36,NA
can keep the blood sugar levels down the,244.55,6.0,250.55,NA
prognosis in terms of eyesight and renal,247.36,6.73,254.09,NA
function is improved so good glycemic,250.55,6.78,257.33,NA
control absolutely vital good blood,254.09,5.73,259.82,NA
pressure control also important for the,257.33,6.089,263.419,NA
retina just as it's important for the,259.82,6.96,266.78,NA
kidneys so we've looked at the micro,263.419,4.961,268.38,NA
vascular disease call,266.78,4.48,271.26,NA
in diabetic nephropathy affecting the,268.38,6.12,274.5,NA
kidneys retinopathy affecting the eyes,271.26,5.78,277.03999999999996,NA
and the next one we want to look at is,274.5,5.51,280.01,NA
neuropathy as it can affect the nervous,277.04,7.65,284.69,NA
system affecting the neurons,280.01,4.68,284.69,NA
