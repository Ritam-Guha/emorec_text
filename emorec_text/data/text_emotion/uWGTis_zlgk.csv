now as you know the retina is the light sensitive area at the back of the eye contains rods and cones the light-sensitive cells and these convert the light impulse into an electrical,7.62,28.929000000000002,36.549,angry
impulse which goes to the optic nerve and onto the occipital lobe of the brain where it's interpreting this vision so here we have the retina at the back of the eye and as we know in diabetes part,22.39,28.8,51.19,angry
of the problem is that the capillaries get thicker basement membrane so there's a thickening of the basement membrane and as well as being thicker as we've said the basement membrane is more,36.67,34.739,71.40899999999999,angry
permeable so plasma fluid can leak out into the retina so the capillaries in the retina can become leaky and we can get exudate accumulating in areas of the retina and this can damage the very,53.019,35.339999999999996,88.359,angry
delicate light-sensitive cells as a result of the aging age but as the basement membranes become thicker the thick basement membrane kind of starts to close off the capillaries and as well,71.439,35.671,107.10999999999999,angry
as that it loses the pulsatile ability which evens out the blood flowing through to the tissue so what this means is you can start to get ischemic changes in the areas of the rest of this,89.619,26.189,115.80799999999999,NA
microscopic blood vessel would normally supply and as well as that you get trouble iteration of the endothelial cells inside the capillaries so you get thickening of the basement membrane,103.149,33.150999999999996,136.3,NA
pushing in you lose the ability to smooth out the blood flow and also the lumen of the pillory gets clogged up by a proliferation of vascular endothelial cells and this means that an area of the,118.84,28.961,147.801,NA
retina now is going to be ischemic and therefore hypoxia not hypoxic so that's bad that's bad for the retina as well so we're areas of every day and now we've,135.01,25.93,160.94,angry
got an area of hypoxic ischemia so that's bad but the hypoxia stimulates the development of new blood vessels as well so the hypoxia because there's in a hypoxic area that stimulates new blood,146.18,37.17,183.35000000000002,angry
vessels to grow into the retina and you might think that that's good in fact descent in a sense it is good because blood can go in the new blood vessels to this area of the retina and,163.82,25.77,189.59,angry
carry oxygen and correct the hypoxia so that sounds good that the retinas kind of healed itself but the problem is these new blood vessels develop quickly and die of low quality the walls of,177.95,26.990000000000002,204.94,angry
these new blood vessels are quite friable and they burst so you can get bursting of these walls leading to areas of blood leaking out into the retina and of course this gives us a retinal,192.29,34.6,226.89,angry
hemorrhage then we get retinal hemorrhage and the presence of the blood lying over the retina will kill the retinal cells in that area so we've got exudates accumulating accumulating in,207.95,32.61,240.56,angry
the retina we've got hypoxia we've got new blood vessels which are bursting causing retinal hemorrhages so there's quite a few insults to the retina here so what are we going to do about this,225.23,22.759999999999998,247.98999999999998,angry
well again we need to keep the blood sugar down near physiological levels many trials have shown this that if you can keep the blood sugar levels down the prognosis in terms of eyesight and renal,236.89,28.39,265.28,angry
