so acromegaly as you know,2.399,4.4,6.799,sad
is a disease that's caused by a growth,4.64,4.879,9.518999999999998,sad
hormone secreting pituitary tumor,6.799,5.281,12.08,sad
and it usually occurs in patients in the,9.519,4.881,14.4,sad
middle of life like around their 30s or,12.08,4.32,16.4,sad
40s but it can be diagnosed younger,14.4,4.16,18.560000000000002,sad
which case people get to be giants if,16.4,2.799,19.198999999999998,sad
they've,18.56,2.719,21.279,fear
get it before their bones close at,19.199,3.041,22.240000000000002,fear
puberty,21.279,2.721,24.0,sad
or it can be very late in life and we,22.24,3.199,25.439,sad
have some patients that are,24.0,3.599,27.599,sad
elderly with acromegaly and diagnosed,25.439,3.041,28.48,sad
even in,27.599,4.721,32.32,sad
the eighth decade so it can be in men,28.48,5.84,34.32,sad
it can be in women but the feature that,32.32,3.919,36.239,sad
they all have is they all do have,34.32,4.8,39.12,sad
excess growth hormone and the signs and,36.239,4.801,41.04,sad
symptoms associated with that can be,39.12,2.4,41.519999999999996,sad
growth,41.04,4.24,45.28,sad
of the hands of the feet of the head,41.52,5.44,46.96,sad
they can get facial changes with,45.28,3.04,48.32,sad
thickening of their lips,46.96,3.759,50.719,sad
and their tongue and their nose so even,48.32,4.239,52.559,sad
after a person stops growing because,50.719,2.961,53.68,sad
they've gone through puberty and they,52.559,2.32,54.879,fear
won't get taller,53.68,3.6,57.28,fear
they can still get growth of cartilage,54.879,3.441,58.32,sad
and changes,57.28,2.959,60.239000000000004,sad
in their facial features their hands and,58.32,3.28,61.6,sad
their feet,60.239,2.8,63.038999999999994,sad
a lot of patients won't know they have,61.6,3.36,64.96000000000001,neutral
this the changes are so slow,63.039,4.161,67.2,sad
over a long period of time they may be,64.96,4.4,69.36,sad
suffering from joint pain diabetes,67.2,3.12,70.32000000000001,sad
hypertension,69.36,3.92,73.28,sad
sleep apnea which are all comorbidities,70.32,4.24,74.55999999999999,sad
of acromegaly,73.28,2.64,75.92,sad
they don't know that they have the,74.56,3.84,78.4,sad
disease until someone recognizes their,75.92,3.519,79.43900000000001,sad
features,78.4,3.2,81.60000000000001,sad
or they end up going to a doctor who,79.439,3.601,83.03999999999999,sad
knows enough to put,81.6,3.36,84.96,sad
pieces together and say ah let's test,83.04,3.2,86.24000000000001,sad
you for acromegaly,84.96,3.28,88.24,sad
most common um ways to present with,86.24,3.28,89.52,sad
acromegaly,88.24,3.519,91.759,sad
are growth of the hands and feet so,89.52,3.599,93.119,sad
actual changes,91.759,4.881,96.64,sad
headaches or incidental meaning they're,93.119,5.441,98.56,sad
meeting up with someone from a medical,96.64,4.0,100.64,sad
professional team,98.56,3.68,102.24000000000001,sad
unrelated to their acromegaly but,100.64,3.2,103.84,fear
someone identifies their features so,102.24,3.199,105.439,sad
those are the most fascinating cases and,103.84,3.919,107.759,sad
we have some great examples for example,105.439,5.68,111.119,sad
of one of my colleagues who had,107.759,6.561,114.32,sad
as a child live next door to a patient,111.119,3.521,114.64,sad
who,114.32,2.32,116.63999999999999,sad
went on to get acromegaly but when he,114.64,4.159,118.799,sad
was running for office 30 years later,116.64,4.56,121.2,sad
she saw his picture in the newspaper,118.799,4.481,123.28,sad
and said she was an endocrinologist and,121.2,3.68,124.88000000000001,sad
said oh my god i grew up with this guy,123.28,2.799,126.07900000000001,sad
he looks so different i know he has,124.88,3.2,128.07999999999998,sad
afromedley she tested him he had it he,126.079,2.8,128.879,sad
was cured,128.08,2.64,130.72,neutral
so that was a case where he didn't,128.879,3.761,132.64,sad
present with any symptom at all,130.72,3.92,134.64,sad
but some endocrinologist recognized his,132.64,4.0,136.64,sad
features and knew to test for it we get,134.64,4.48,139.11999999999998,sad
examples like that where physicians are,136.64,4.4,141.04,sad
in an audience of an opera singer and,139.12,4.479,143.59900000000002,sad
they recognize the facial features and,141.04,4.4,145.44,sad
it's always a trick of what to say and,143.599,8.081,151.67999999999998,sad
when to say it,145.44,6.24,151.68,sad
