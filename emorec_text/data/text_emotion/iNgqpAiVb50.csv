so acromegaly as you know,2.399,4.4,6.799,
is a disease that's caused by a growth,4.64,4.879,9.518999999999998,neutral
hormone secreting pituitary tumor,6.799,5.281,12.08,neutral
and it usually occurs in patients in the,9.519,4.881,14.4,neutral
middle of life like around their 30s or,12.08,4.32,16.4,fear
40s but it can be diagnosed younger,14.4,4.16,18.560000000000002,neutral
which case people get to be giants if,16.4,2.799,19.198999999999998,neutral
they've,18.56,2.719,21.279,neutral
get it before their bones close at,19.199,3.041,22.240000000000002,neutral
puberty,21.279,2.721,24.0,neutral
or it can be very late in life and we,22.24,3.199,25.439,neutral
have some patients that are,24.0,3.599,27.599,neutral
elderly with acromegaly and diagnosed,25.439,3.041,28.48,neutral
even in,27.599,4.721,32.32,neutral
the eighth decade so it can be in men,28.48,5.84,34.32,neutral
it can be in women but the feature that,32.32,3.919,36.239,neutral
they all have is they all do have,34.32,4.8,39.12,neutral
excess growth hormone and the signs and,36.239,4.801,41.04,neutral
symptoms associated with that can be,39.12,2.4,41.519999999999996,neutral
growth,41.04,4.24,45.28,neutral
of the hands of the feet of the head,41.52,5.44,46.96,neutral
they can get facial changes with,45.28,3.04,48.32,neutral
thickening of their lips,46.96,3.759,50.719,neutral
and their tongue and their nose so even,48.32,4.239,52.559,neutral
after a person stops growing because,50.719,2.961,53.68,neutral
they've gone through puberty and they,52.559,2.32,54.879,neutral
won't get taller,53.68,3.6,57.28,neutral
they can still get growth of cartilage,54.879,3.441,58.32,neutral
and changes,57.28,2.959,60.239000000000004,happy
in their facial features their hands and,58.32,3.28,61.6,neutral
their feet,60.239,2.8,63.038999999999994,neutral
a lot of patients won't know they have,61.6,3.36,64.96000000000001,neutral
this the changes are so slow,63.039,4.161,67.2,neutral
over a long period of time they may be,64.96,4.4,69.36,neutral
suffering from joint pain diabetes,67.2,3.12,70.32000000000001,neutral
hypertension,69.36,3.92,73.28,neutral
sleep apnea which are all comorbidities,70.32,4.24,74.55999999999999,fear
of acromegaly,73.28,2.64,75.92,sad
they don't know that they have the,74.56,3.84,78.4,neutral
disease until someone recognizes their,75.92,3.519,79.43900000000001,neutral
features,78.4,3.2,81.60000000000001,neutral
or they end up going to a doctor who,79.439,3.601,83.03999999999999,neutral
knows enough to put,81.6,3.36,84.96,neutral
pieces together and say ah let's test,83.04,3.2,86.24000000000001,neutral
you for acromegaly,84.96,3.28,88.24,neutral
most common um ways to present with,86.24,3.28,89.52,neutral
acromegaly,88.24,3.519,91.759,neutral
are growth of the hands and feet so,89.52,3.599,93.119,neutral
actual changes,91.759,4.881,96.64,neutral
headaches or incidental meaning they're,93.119,5.441,98.56,neutral
meeting up with someone from a medical,96.64,4.0,100.64,fear
professional team,98.56,3.68,102.24000000000001,neutral
unrelated to their acromegaly but,100.64,3.2,103.84,neutral
someone identifies their features so,102.24,3.199,105.439,neutral
those are the most fascinating cases and,103.84,3.919,107.759,neutral
we have some great examples for example,105.439,5.68,111.119,fear
of one of my colleagues who had,107.759,6.561,114.32,fear
as a child live next door to a patient,111.119,3.521,114.64,fear
who,114.32,2.32,116.63999999999999,neutral
went on to get acromegaly but when he,114.64,4.159,118.799,neutral
was running for office 30 years later,116.64,4.56,121.2,neutral
she saw his picture in the newspaper,118.799,4.481,123.28,neutral
and said she was an endocrinologist and,121.2,3.68,124.88000000000001,fear
said oh my god i grew up with this guy,123.28,2.799,126.07900000000001,sad
he looks so different i know he has,124.88,3.2,128.07999999999998,neutral
afromedley she tested him he had it he,126.079,2.8,128.879,neutral
was cured,128.08,2.64,130.72,neutral
so that was a case where he didn't,128.879,3.761,132.64,neutral
present with any symptom at all,130.72,3.92,134.64,neutral
but some endocrinologist recognized his,132.64,4.0,136.64,fear
features and knew to test for it we get,134.64,4.48,139.11999999999998,neutral
examples like that where physicians are,136.64,4.4,141.04,neutral
in an audience of an opera singer and,139.12,4.479,143.59900000000002,neutral
they recognize the facial features and,141.04,4.4,145.44,neutral
it's always a trick of what to say and,143.599,8.081,151.67999999999998,neutral
when to say it,145.44,6.24,151.68,neutral
