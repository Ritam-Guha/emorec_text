hey how far is it to the farmers market,0.03,4.499,4.529,fear
about 15 minutes from here this is an,2.25,4.2,6.45,fear
example of how sometimes we ask a,4.529,4.201,8.73,fear
question using one measure the distance,6.45,4.2,10.65,fear
to the farmers market and answer it,8.73,3.72,12.450000000000001,fear
using a different measure while it is,10.65,3.75,14.4,fear
convenient to describe the travel time,12.45,4.05,16.5,surprise
to the market and make some assumptions,14.4,4.17,18.57,surprise
about our mode of transportation and it,16.5,3.72,20.22,surprise
doesn't actually use the units of,18.57,5.4,23.97,fear
distance body mass index or BMI is kind,20.22,6.54,26.759999999999998,fear
of like that for our health BMI is used,23.97,4.889,28.858999999999998,fear
as an indicator of body fat to assess,26.76,4.439,31.199,fear
disease risk but it doesn't actually,28.859,5.311,34.17,fear
measure body fat so why is BMI the go-to,31.199,11.79,42.989000000000004,fear
marker hey nerville I'm dr. Laura body,34.17,12.15,46.32,fear
mass index abbreviated as BMI is used as,42.989,5.851,48.839999999999996,surprise
an indicator for body fat BMI is,46.32,4.44,50.76,neutral
calculated by dividing your weight in,48.84,3.48,52.32,NA
kilograms by your height in meters,50.76,3.24,54.0,NA
squared to give you a value that,52.32,3.12,55.44,NA
determines your weight category,54.0,3.93,57.93,NA
according to the CDC a healthy weight,55.44,4.83,60.269999999999996,NA
BMI is eighteen point five to twenty,57.93,4.62,62.55,NA
four point nine underweight as below,60.27,4.889,65.159,NA
eighteen point five overweight as twenty,62.55,4.889,67.439,NA
five to twenty nine point nine and obese,65.159,4.201,69.36,NA
is greater than thirty you can use an,67.439,4.11,71.54899999999999,NA
online calculator to determine your BMI,69.36,4.259,73.619,NA
then you can avoid those pesky unit,71.549,4.801,76.35000000000001,NA
conversions as you can see BMI is really,73.619,4.771,78.39,fear
quick and easy to calculate so it's been,76.35,3.78,80.13,fear
used to monitor obesity trends in,78.39,3.72,82.11,NA
populations and to screen patients and,80.13,3.96,84.08999999999999,fear
doctors offices research studies have,82.11,4.23,86.34,fear
consistently demonstrated that a BMI in,84.09,4.529,88.619,fear
the obese range strongly correlates with,86.34,4.56,90.9,fear
many chronic diseases including type-2,88.619,4.621,93.24,fear
diabetes cardiovascular disease and,90.9,4.679,95.57900000000001,fear
metabolic syndrome however correlation,93.24,4.559,97.79899999999999,fear
is not causation and it turns out that,95.579,4.741,100.32,fear
BMI has many caveats when used to screen,97.799,4.081,101.88000000000001,fear
for health conditions related to body,100.32,4.259,104.579,fear
fat first BMI can't differentiate,101.88,5.07,106.94999999999999,fear
between body fat and lean body mass,104.579,5.131,109.71,fear
which is the weight of your bones organs,106.95,5.58,112.53,fear
and muscles at the population level BMI,109.71,5.339,115.04899999999999,fear
does correlate with body fat but this,112.53,4.17,116.7,surprise
isn't always the case at the individual,115.049,3.871,118.92,fear
level for example athletes tend to have,116.7,4.199,120.899,fear
more muscle mass which is heavier than,118.92,4.86,123.78,NA
fat so sometimes their BMI classifies,120.899,4.981,125.88,NA
them as overweight or obese despite,123.78,4.019,127.799,NA
being very healthy the opposite is also,125.88,3.96,129.84,NA
true in elderly individuals who tend to,127.799,2.82,130.619,NA
lose muscle,129.84,2.58,132.42000000000002,NA
and replace it with fact meaning that,130.619,3.93,134.549,NA
they may have a healthy BMI despite a,132.42,4.95,137.36999999999998,fear
high percent body fat second the BMI,134.549,4.5,139.049,fear
weight categories were originally,137.37,3.449,140.81900000000002,fear
determined using research on white,139.049,3.631,142.68,fear
subjects different ethnicities have,140.819,3.871,144.69,fear
variations in body composition and,142.68,4.35,147.03,fear
metabolism meaning that the obese BMI,144.69,4.56,149.25,fear
range should be different by ethnicity,147.03,4.11,151.14000000000001,neutral
for example if we look at a white woman,149.25,4.26,153.51,neutral
a black woman and an Asian woman who all,151.14,5.28,156.42,neutral
have the same BMI the black woman would,153.51,5.039,158.54899999999998,neutral
have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and,156.42,4.2,160.61999999999998,happy
the Asian woman would have a higher risk,158.549,4.711,163.26000000000002,neutral
