hey how far is it to the farmers market about 15 minutes from here this is an example of how sometimes we ask a question using one measure the distance to the farmers market and answer it,0.03,20.819999999999997,20.849999999999998,angry
using a different measure while it is convenient to describe the travel time to the market and make some assumptions about our mode of transportation and it doesn't actually use the units of,10.65,21.09,31.740000000000002,angry
distance body mass index or BMI is kind of like that for our health BMI is used as an indicator of body fat to assess disease risk but it doesn't actually measure body fat so why is BMI the go-to,20.22,32.969,53.189,angry
marker hey nerville I'm dr. Laura body mass index abbreviated as BMI is used as an indicator for body fat BMI is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters,34.17,29.161,63.331,angry
squared to give you a value that determines your weight category according to the CDC a healthy weight BMI is eighteen point five to twenty four point nine underweight as below,52.32,21.389,73.709,NA
eighteen point five overweight as twenty five to twenty nine point nine and obese is greater than thirty you can use an online calculator to determine your BMI then you can avoid those pesky unit,62.55,22.259999999999998,84.81,angry
conversions as you can see BMI is really quick and easy to calculate so it's been used to monitor obesity trends in populations and to screen patients and doctors offices research studies have,73.619,20.461000000000002,94.08,angry
consistently demonstrated that a BMI in the obese range strongly correlates with many chronic diseases including type-2 diabetes cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome however correlation,84.09,22.948,107.03800000000001,angry
is not causation and it turns out that BMI has many caveats when used to screen for health conditions related to body fat first BMI can't differentiate between body fat and lean body mass,95.579,23.282,118.86099999999999,angry
which is the weight of your bones organs and muscles at the population level BMI does correlate with body fat but this isn't always the case at the individual level for example athletes tend to have,106.95,23.159,130.109,angry
more muscle mass which is heavier than fat so sometimes their BMI classifies them as overweight or obese despite being very healthy the opposite is also true in elderly individuals who tend to,118.92,20.64,139.56,angry
lose muscle and replace it with fact meaning that they may have a healthy BMI despite a high percent body fat second the BMI weight categories were originally,129.84,19.409,149.249,angry
determined using research on white subjects different ethnicities have variations in body composition and metabolism meaning that the obese BMI range should be different by ethnicity,139.049,20.522,159.571,angry
for example if we look at a white woman a black woman and an Asian woman who all have the same BMI the black woman would have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and the Asian woman would have a higher risk,149.25,23.490000000000002,172.74,angry
compared to the white woman third BMI doesn't indicate body fat distribution it's not just the percentage of total body fat but rather where that fat is located on the body that plays a,160.62,21.509999999999998,182.13,angry
causative role in disease development central obesity is the accumulation of fat around the abdomen this deep belly fat also called visceral fat functions differently than the subcutaneous fat,171.75,20.88,192.63,angry
that is immediately under our skin visceral fat tends to be more inflammatory and less sensitive to the hormone insulin factors which drive the development of diseases like type 2,182.34,20.789,203.12900000000002,angry
diabetes and cardiovascular disease there are some alternative measures to assess body fat that are better predictors of disease risk waist circumference more directly measures,192.51,17.971,210.481,NA
central obesity so it's a better reflection of body fat distribution at high risk areas currently American organizations classify central obesity as a waist circumference greater than 35,201.72,20.878,222.598,angry
inches in women and greater than 40 inches in men the International Diabetes Federation has published separate classifications by ethnicity to take body composition variation into account,211.889,21.480999999999998,233.37,angry
waist circumference is not perfect and there are many other more direct measures of body fat that are useful in research settings but not feasible at the population or clinical level BMI is,222.629,20.459,243.088,angry
a convenient but inaccurate measure especially when applied to individuals waist circumference is equivalently feasible to measure and may be a better tool at both the population and,232.829,20.041,252.87,angry
individual level because it more directly assesses the causative factors of central obesity both of these measures are meant for screening only and not as diagnostic tools regardless,243.06,21.451,264.511,angry
of your BMI or waist circumference there are some behaviors that should be the foundation of all healthy lifestyles like eating a balanced diet hi in fruits and vegetables limiting,253.62,18.939999999999998,272.56,angry
added sugars and engaging in super fun physical activity and that's what science tastes like thanks for tuning in to nourish Abel if you like what you're learning please share subscribe and ring,263.0,18.509999999999998,281.51,angry
