when I first got diagnosed with end-stage renal disease I was a student in medical school I was in the UK doing clinical rotations when I started to show signs and symptoms in a situation,0.06,35.48,35.54,angry
where Dallas is not available then I would have things like vomiting diarrhea fatigue lethargy if it gets really bad meaning that I do not get dialysis for an extended period of time,17.52,31.901000000000003,49.42100000000001,angry
I have had situations where I had seizures I had a read Mia when my potassium built up too high I had black holes I had to end up in the,33.57,24.959999999999997,58.53,angry
ICU on three occasions well currently we only have one hemodialysis units in Grenada which is privately run and I mean hemodialysis is a very expensive procedure it's expensive to maintain and,45.6,30.799999999999997,76.4,angry
the optimum treatment would be three times a week but because of cost I would only do twice a week you can survive but you're not as strong as you could be there is an alternative to the,61.34,35.67999999999999,97.02,angry
modalities which is peritoneal dialysis the peritoneal dialysis is a little cheaper and it's more convenient in that you can do it at home where I saw the hemodialysis you would have to take time,79.32,24.418999999999997,103.73899999999999,sad
out of your schedule to go to the unit to sit there for three to four hours to get treatment patients who have CVA heart problems hemodialysis might not be the best,91.65,23.099999999999998,114.75,angry
treatment for them because it puts a lot of pressure on your heart whereas patients who have polycystic kidney disease with very large cysts or patients who might be pregnant or,103.53,26.959999999999997,130.49,angry
patients who are like very large in terms of size who might not have a lot of abdominal space they might not be able to accommodate the peritoneal dialysis so it's a matter of knowing the,115.82,23.470000000000002,139.29,sad
patient and then getting to choose what is the best option for them because the cost of dialysis it's very difficult for the average Canadian to our food so if we can get more in terms of,128.22,32.791,161.011,angry
subsidizing costs making treatment work readily available it would be a lot better for the Grenadian public I am NOT going to say government need to have their own dialysis per se but at least,144.6,29.94,174.54,angry
if we had dialysis available at the hospital so patients who are hospitalized don't have to get into an ambulance to get drop-top senticles needs to get repairs I don't have to get,160.2,22.049999999999997,182.25,angry
collected to come back we need social and psychological support because it's it can be a lot to deal with and even for the family members it can be a lot to do it,171.15,21.749999999999996,192.9,angry
because there was two occasions when my son had to be the one to find me passed out and call ambulance to come get me that was traumatic for him I think education is going to play an important,182.04,34.98,217.01999999999998,angry
role in and once people get to know that this is what is happening then they would understand better because sometimes you hear persons wanting to give you advice about what herbs to take,198.33,29.160000000000004,227.49,angry
and stuff like that but there's a difference between keep the problems and and stitch we're now seeing it once everybody is well educated we don't you realize that having TB,212.67,30.36,243.02999999999997,angry
disease is just like having any other disease once you get your treatment you can live with it a diabetic once you get the incident they can't evoke a normal life they can continue working so it's,228.87,30.03,258.9,angry
same thing with kidney disease once treatment is available then you can you can live with it,244.35,14.2,258.55,angry
