there are two things that diabetic,0.03,5.999,6.029,neutral
patients tend to develop with diabetic,2.1,6.72,8.82,neutral
retinopathy one is swelling and one is,6.029,5.581,11.61,neutral
bleeding and swelling is a general sort,8.82,5.52,14.34,neutral
of collection of fluid in the retina,11.61,4.83,16.439999999999998,neutral
which affects central vision,14.34,5.34,19.68,neutral
now most people develop it slowly and,16.44,5.339,21.779000000000003,neutral
they start to struggle with things like,19.68,4.95,24.63,neutral
reading they notice a bit of blur to the,21.779,4.83,26.609,neutral
side of the vision it interferes with,24.63,4.649,29.279,neutral
their computer work they start to notice,26.609,4.68,31.289,neutral
that but they tend to adapt no if it,29.279,4.011,33.29,neutral
affects both eyes they can get quite,31.289,4.591,35.88,neutral
incapacitated to struggle with their,33.29,5.53,38.82,neutral
computer work staring at screens makes,35.88,5.82,41.7,neutral
it much harder to do for longer periods,38.82,4.309,43.129,neutral
and the struggle with right reading,41.7,4.679,46.379000000000005,neutral
actually written words on text and,43.129,7.601,50.73,neutral
newspapers and documents if they have,46.379,7.261,53.64,neutral
treatment they tend to improve quite,50.73,5.61,56.339999999999996,neutral
significantly and get back to doing all,53.64,5.489,59.129,sad
of that stuff pretty quickly but again,56.34,5.129,61.469,sad
it's a course of treatment with the,59.129,3.961,63.089999999999996,neutral
people who have bleeds in the back of,61.469,5.371,66.84,neutral
the eye of those that rare minority they,63.09,5.069,68.159,neutral
need a course of treatment it takes a,66.84,4.08,70.92,neutral
lot longer to recover so that process is,68.159,5.64,73.799,neutral
gradual and also the anxiety that they,70.92,5.82,76.74000000000001,neutral
come to me with a nervousness takes time,73.799,4.89,78.68900000000001,neutral
to improve because I'm not giving them,76.74,5.879,82.619,neutral
an instant treatment fix and over a,78.689,6.691,85.38,neutral
course of time most of those patients,82.619,6.241,88.86,neutral
will see again very well and they'll,85.38,5.849,91.229,neutral
kind of forget that they had poor vision,88.86,4.35,93.21,NA
at the beginning that a gradual,91.229,4.201,95.42999999999999,NA
improvement it's not a sudden thing they,93.21,3.939,97.149,NA
notice and wake up,95.43,4.119,99.549,NA
and said no my vision's got better but,97.149,4.47,101.619,NA
it's a gradual improvement but those,99.549,3.901,103.45,NA
patients ultimately are very grateful,101.619,4.35,105.969,NA
because they understand that if that,103.45,4.11,107.56,NA
intervention hadn't occurred at that,105.969,3.75,109.719,NA
point the consequences could have been,107.56,3.36,110.92,NA
much worse,109.719,12.311,122.03,NA
