hi guys in this video we're gonna talk,0.0,3.06,3.06,fear
about the difference between the,1.56,4.14,5.699999999999999,neutral
glycemic index and the glycemic load I,3.06,3.9,6.96,neutral
don't know if you ever heard about this,5.7,3.39,9.09,neutral
one probably this one but a lot of,6.96,3.57,10.53,neutral
people have not heard about this one but,9.09,3.509,12.599,fear
there's two different factors here we,10.53,3.42,13.95,fear
want to talk about especially when we're,12.599,2.881,15.48,fear
dealing with glycemic which means the,13.95,5.1,19.049999999999997,surprise
sugar the glycemic index is how fast,15.48,6.03,21.51,neutral
that carbohydrate is digested or broken,19.05,4.59,23.64,neutral
down into the blood and then how much,21.51,4.679,26.189,neutral
power that has to raise the blood sugar,23.64,3.57,27.21,neutral
okay,26.189,3.031,29.22,neutral
and the speed at which it raises the,27.21,5.069,32.279,neutral
blood sugar whereas the glycemic load is,29.22,4.92,34.14,neutral
a little different it's the concentrated,32.279,4.111,36.39,neutral
amount of carbohydrate or the amount of,34.14,4.739,38.879,neutral
carbohydrate in the food so let me kind,36.39,4.62,41.01,neutral
of give you an example a carrot a raw,38.879,6.09,44.968999999999994,fear
carrot is on the glycemic index 91 right,41.01,9.029,50.039,neutral
now 55 or less is low 56 to 69 is,44.969,8.641,53.61,neutral
moderate over 70 is high so coordinator,50.039,6.211,56.25,NA
this scale but carrot would be high,53.61,7.07,60.68,neutral
because it's 91 okay the glycemic load,56.25,8.28,64.53,neutral
10 is low or 10 or less as low 10 to 20,60.68,7.119,67.799,NA
is moderate greater than 20 is high so,64.53,5.879,70.409,fear
if you look at a raw carrot 91 is pretty,67.799,4.89,72.68900000000001,fear
high on the glycemic index but look at,70.409,5.301,75.71000000000001,fear
the glycemic load it has a factor of 1,72.689,5.731,78.41999999999999,fear
so what we're doing with the glycemic,75.71,4.81,80.52,fear
load is deducting all the fiber it's,78.42,6.42,84.84,fear
very fibrous right so this is not going,80.52,6.66,87.17999999999999,fear
to influence your blood Sugar's nearly,84.84,6.029,90.869,fear
as much as most other foods so let's,87.18,6.479,93.659,fear
kind of go through candy bar okay a,90.869,5.61,96.479,fear
typical candy bar is 68 so that's some,93.659,4.89,98.549,NA
borderline and pretty high and that's a,96.479,5.731,102.21,fear
half a candy bar glycemic load is 23 so,98.549,8.1,106.649,fear
it's still high jellybeans 78 for a 1,102.21,7.29,109.5,fear
ounce and mount of jellybeans glycemic,106.649,5.881,112.53,fear
load is 22 again high there's not a lot,109.5,6.24,115.74,fear
of fiber and jelly beans corn bread to,112.53,5.1,117.63,fear
110 that's pretty high it's off the,115.74,3.089,118.829,fear
charts,117.63,5.419,123.04899999999999,fear
that's 160 gram piece of cornbread,118.829,9.49,128.319,fear
glycemic index of 31 that's pretty high,123.049,10.341,133.39000000000001,fear
grape nut okay that's 75 for a half of a,128.319,7.471,135.79,fear
cup glycemic load is 31 is pretty high,133.39,4.739,138.129,fear
you wouldn't think that Grape Nuts would,135.79,4.77,140.56,fear
be that high as a cereal but it's pretty,138.129,2.791,140.92,happy
high,140.56,4.38,144.94,fear
potato 104 for a one large potato it's a,140.92,6.47,147.39,fear
36 glycemic load that's pretty high,144.94,6.54,151.48,neutral
carrot 91 1 so that would be fine look,147.39,8.379,155.76899999999998,fear
at corn 55 on the glycemic index but 62,151.48,7.709,159.189,fear
on the glycemic load so this is the,155.769,5.041,160.81,fear
worst thing you could possibly eat is,159.189,3.871,163.06,fear
corn especially with related to your,160.81,4.08,164.89000000000001,fear
blood sugars now what I want you to do,163.06,4.319,167.379,fear
is I want you to type down the food that,164.89,4.98,169.86999999999998,fear
you loved and ate as a child that was a,167.379,4.321,171.7,fear
carbohydrate that wasn't too good for,169.87,4.22,174.09,fear
you okay mine was combination between,171.7,5.849,177.54899999999998,fear
Reese's peanut butter cups and Doritos,174.09,6.61,180.70000000000002,fear
and pizza so what was yours I'm curious,177.549,5.03,182.579,fear
all right talk to you later,180.7,4.349,185.04899999999998,fear
hi guys listen I want to thank you so,182.579,4.69,187.269,fear
much for your wonderful comments and I,185.049,3.541,188.59,fear
want to ask you if you wouldn't mind,187.269,3.481,190.75,fear
giving me your review on Google I put a,188.59,4.44,193.03,fear
link down below I'd really appreciate it,190.75,5.419,196.169,fear
and thank you in advance,193.03,3.139,196.169,neutral
