hi guys in this video we're gonna talk,0.0,3.06,3.06,
about the difference between the,1.56,4.14,5.699999999999999,
glycemic index and the glycemic load I,3.06,3.9,6.96,
don't know if you ever heard about this,5.7,3.39,9.09,
one probably this one but a lot of,6.96,3.57,10.53,
people have not heard about this one but,9.09,3.509,12.599,
there's two different factors here we,10.53,3.42,13.95,surprise
want to talk about especially when we're,12.599,2.881,15.48,
dealing with glycemic which means the,13.95,5.1,19.049999999999997,
sugar the glycemic index is how fast,15.48,6.03,21.51,
that carbohydrate is digested or broken,19.05,4.59,23.64,fear
down into the blood and then how much,21.51,4.679,26.189,surprise
power that has to raise the blood sugar,23.64,3.57,27.21,surprise
okay,26.189,3.031,29.22,
and the speed at which it raises the,27.21,5.069,32.279,
blood sugar whereas the glycemic load is,29.22,4.92,34.14,
a little different it's the concentrated,32.279,4.111,36.39,
amount of carbohydrate or the amount of,34.14,4.739,38.879,fear
carbohydrate in the food so let me kind,36.39,4.62,41.01,
of give you an example a carrot a raw,38.879,6.09,44.968999999999994,
carrot is on the glycemic index 91 right,41.01,9.029,50.039,
now 55 or less is low 56 to 69 is,44.969,8.641,53.61,
moderate over 70 is high so coordinator,50.039,6.211,56.25,
this scale but carrot would be high,53.61,7.07,60.68,
because it's 91 okay the glycemic load,56.25,8.28,64.53,
10 is low or 10 or less as low 10 to 20,60.68,7.119,67.799,
is moderate greater than 20 is high so,64.53,5.879,70.409,
if you look at a raw carrot 91 is pretty,67.799,4.89,72.68900000000001,
high on the glycemic index but look at,70.409,5.301,75.71000000000001,
the glycemic load it has a factor of 1,72.689,5.731,78.41999999999999,
so what we're doing with the glycemic,75.71,4.81,80.52,surprise
load is deducting all the fiber it's,78.42,6.42,84.84,
very fibrous right so this is not going,80.52,6.66,87.17999999999999,
to influence your blood Sugar's nearly,84.84,6.029,90.869,
as much as most other foods so let's,87.18,6.479,93.659,
kind of go through candy bar okay a,90.869,5.61,96.479,
typical candy bar is 68 so that's some,93.659,4.89,98.549,
borderline and pretty high and that's a,96.479,5.731,102.21,
half a candy bar glycemic load is 23 so,98.549,8.1,106.649,
it's still high jellybeans 78 for a 1,102.21,7.29,109.5,
ounce and mount of jellybeans glycemic,106.649,5.881,112.53,surprise
load is 22 again high there's not a lot,109.5,6.24,115.74,
of fiber and jelly beans corn bread to,112.53,5.1,117.63,
110 that's pretty high it's off the,115.74,3.089,118.829,surprise
charts,117.63,5.419,123.04899999999999,
that's 160 gram piece of cornbread,118.829,9.49,128.319,
glycemic index of 31 that's pretty high,123.049,10.341,133.39000000000001,
grape nut okay that's 75 for a half of a,128.319,7.471,135.79,
cup glycemic load is 31 is pretty high,133.39,4.739,138.129,
you wouldn't think that Grape Nuts would,135.79,4.77,140.56,
be that high as a cereal but it's pretty,138.129,2.791,140.92,happy
high,140.56,4.38,144.94,
potato 104 for a one large potato it's a,140.92,6.47,147.39,
36 glycemic load that's pretty high,144.94,6.54,151.48,
carrot 91 1 so that would be fine look,147.39,8.379,155.76899999999998,
at corn 55 on the glycemic index but 62,151.48,7.709,159.189,
on the glycemic load so this is the,155.769,5.041,160.81,fear
worst thing you could possibly eat is,159.189,3.871,163.06,fear
corn especially with related to your,160.81,4.08,164.89000000000001,fear
blood sugars now what I want you to do,163.06,4.319,167.379,fear
is I want you to type down the food that,164.89,4.98,169.86999999999998,surprise
you loved and ate as a child that was a,167.379,4.321,171.7,
carbohydrate that wasn't too good for,169.87,4.22,174.09,
you okay mine was combination between,171.7,5.849,177.54899999999998,fear
Reese's peanut butter cups and Doritos,174.09,6.61,180.70000000000002,surprise
and pizza so what was yours I'm curious,177.549,5.03,182.579,surprise
all right talk to you later,180.7,4.349,185.04899999999998,
hi guys listen I want to thank you so,182.579,4.69,187.269,

link down below I'd really appreciate it,190.75,5.419,196.169,fear
and thank you in advance,193.03,3.139,196.169,happy
