I'm David Adams and I'm professor of,5.71,4.53,10.24,
surgery at the Medical University of,8.65,3.45,12.100000000000001,neutral
South Carolina and co-director of the,10.24,4.08,14.32,neutral
digestive disease center I've been here,12.1,5.4,17.5,neutral
for 30 years and my practice has been,14.32,5.48,19.8,neutral
taking care of people with complicated,17.5,5.31,22.81,neutral
disorders of their abdomen and the,19.8,5.439,25.239,neutral
organs that lie inside the abdominal,22.81,5.46,28.27,neutral
cavity one of the organs that can be,25.239,6.241,31.48,neutral
really pain just a terrible cause of,28.27,6.36,34.63,neutral
suffering is the stomach and what I'm,31.48,5.34,36.82,neutral
talking about today are patients who,34.63,4.979,39.609,angry
have stomachs that stopped working for a,36.82,6.12,42.94,neutral
variety of reasons we call this gastric,39.609,5.581,45.190000000000005,neutral
paris's and it means paralysis of the,42.94,5.459,48.399,
stomach it occurs frequently in patients,45.19,7.47,52.66,
who have diabetes and it also occurs for,48.399,6.68,55.079,
reasons that we don't understand,52.66,4.649,57.309,
sometimes we think there may be some,55.079,4.631,59.71,
viral illness that causes a dysfunction,57.309,5.12,62.428999999999995,neutral
but it shows up in a large number of,59.71,5.54,65.25,neutral
women in the middle years of their life,62.429,5.441,67.87,neutral
most patients with gastric Parris's can,65.25,4.57,69.82,neutral
be managed with a variety of medicines,67.87,5.88,73.75,
but there's some patients in whom all,69.82,6.119,75.939,neutral
the medicines in the world are given to,73.75,5.34,79.09,neutral
and they continue to have debilitating,75.939,7.021,82.96,neutral
nausea vomiting and frequently have,79.09,6.87,85.96000000000001,neutral
weight loss which may require feeding,82.96,6.57,89.53,neutral
with feeding tubes or even intravenous,85.96,6.269,92.229,neutral
feeding it's possible to correct this,89.53,4.71,94.24,neutral
condition when medical treatment fails,92.229,4.771,97.0,neutral
with a surgical procedure which involves,94.24,5.269,99.509,neutral
putting a pacemaker into the stomach,97.0,5.31,102.31,
similar to what you do for a heart that,99.509,4.691,104.2,
has a malfunction in its electrical,102.31,5.46,107.77,
system Medtronic has developed this,104.2,7.589,111.789,
system and what it is it's a small disc,107.77,6.9,114.67,
shape generator it has a battery in it,111.789,5.94,117.729,
that gets placed underneath the skin and,114.67,7.309,121.979,
it's connected by wires into the stomach,117.729,7.261,124.99,
there are two leads that get placed into,121.979,5.021,127.0,neutral
the wall of the stomach and they,124.99,4.5,129.49,neutral
stimulate the electrical system of the,127.0,4.71,131.71,neutral
stomach with an intermittent pulse of,129.49,5.31,134.8,neutral
electricity in many patients this is,131.71,6.06,137.77,neutral
miraculous they may wake up from surgery,134.8,4.87,139.67000000000002,neutral
in nausea which is,137.77,4.95,142.72,neutral
and present for years is suddenly gone,139.67,6.0,145.67,neutral
they are able to eat they were able to,142.72,6.76,149.48,neutral
get off of feeding tubes intravenous,145.67,6.63,152.29999999999998,neutral
feeding it can really be life-changing,149.48,6.99,156.47,neutral
for many patients in particular young,152.3,6.75,159.05,neutral
diabetics seem to do very well with this,156.47,5.43,161.9,neutral
procedure because the electrical signal,159.05,6.3,165.35000000000002,neutral
seems to interrupt the signals that give,161.9,8.43,170.33,neutral
them nausea so that a young diabetic,165.35,8.1,173.45,
patient who spends his days and weeks in,170.33,5.939,176.269,
and out of the emergency room for poo,173.45,6.89,180.33999999999997,neutral
poor blood sugar control for dehydration,176.269,7.621,183.89000000000001,neutral
suddenly is able to take a diet where,180.34,6.52,186.86,neutral
they can control their diabetes where,183.89,5.84,189.73,neutral
they can nourish themselves by mouth and,186.86,6.629,193.489,neutral
avoid the repetitive visits to emergency,189.73,7.089,196.819,neutral
rooms and hospitalizations we've been,193.489,7.53,201.019,neutral
doing this at MUSC for over five years,196.819,7.941,204.76,neutral
that have done over a hundred patients,201.019,7.231,208.25,neutral
and it doesn't work in everyone some,204.76,6.9,211.66,
patients it's effective immediately,208.25,6.299,214.549,
others it may take two to three months,211.66,5.859,217.519,
for the electrical architecture of the,214.549,4.981,219.53,
stomach to remodel so that they benefit,217.519,7.081,224.6,
from it the Pacers are run by a small,219.53,8.37,227.9,
battery and for patients who have the,224.6,6.12,230.72,
Pacers effective at a low setting the,227.9,5.0,232.9,
battery may last for six to eight years,230.72,6.21,236.93,
other patients require running the,232.9,6.76,239.66,
generator at high settings and the,236.93,5.82,242.75,
generators in that case may run out in a,239.66,7.049,246.709,neutral
year's time sometimes even less when the,242.75,6.51,249.26,neutral
battery runs out of juice it's an,246.709,5.12,251.829,neutral
outpatient procedure to replace it,249.26,5.55,254.81,neutral
patients come in to the hospital go to,251.829,6.31,258.139,neutral
the operating room and in a 30 minute,254.81,6.899,261.709,
procedure we remove the generator and,258.139,6.361,264.5,neutral
replace it with a new one I think,261.709,6.241,267.95,neutral
the placement of a gastric stimulator,264.5,7.08,271.58,neutral
can be a life-saving,267.95,7.05,275.0,neutral
procedure for many patients who have not,271.58,5.369,276.94899999999996,
benefited from traditional medical,275.0,4.919,279.919,neutral
therapy it definitely can improve the,276.949,7.171,284.12,neutral
quality of life and it's a procedure,279.919,7.74,287.659,neutral
that has a low complication rate low,284.12,7.41,291.53000000000003,
risk rate and I'm very pleased that we,287.659,6.121,293.78,neutral
can offer it here in South Carolina to,291.53,4.919,296.44899999999996,neutral
many patients who need it and many,293.78,4.47,298.25,neutral
patients who may not be aware that it's,296.449,4.56,301.009,neutral
available and that is a possible,298.25,6.21,304.46,neutral
solution to what could be years of,301.009,8.31,309.319,neutral
nausea vomiting malnutrition and need,304.46,7.859,312.31899999999996,neutral
for multiple emergency room and hospital,309.319,5.211,314.53000000000003,neutral
visits,312.319,2.211,314.53000000000003,
