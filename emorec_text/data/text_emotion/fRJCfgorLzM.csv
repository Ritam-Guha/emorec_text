I'm David Adams and I'm professor of,5.71,4.53,10.24,sad
surgery at the Medical University of,8.65,3.45,12.100000000000001,sad
South Carolina and co-director of the,10.24,4.08,14.32,sad
digestive disease center I've been here,12.1,5.4,17.5,fear
for 30 years and my practice has been,14.32,5.48,19.8,sad
taking care of people with complicated,17.5,5.31,22.81,sad
disorders of their abdomen and the,19.8,5.439,25.239,sad
organs that lie inside the abdominal,22.81,5.46,28.27,sad
cavity one of the organs that can be,25.239,6.241,31.48,sad
really pain just a terrible cause of,28.27,6.36,34.63,sad
suffering is the stomach and what I'm,31.48,5.34,36.82,neutral
talking about today are patients who,34.63,4.979,39.609,sad
have stomachs that stopped working for a,36.82,6.12,42.94,sad
variety of reasons we call this gastric,39.609,5.581,45.190000000000005,neutral
paris's and it means paralysis of the,42.94,5.459,48.399,NA
stomach it occurs frequently in patients,45.19,7.47,52.66,NA
who have diabetes and it also occurs for,48.399,6.68,55.079,NA
reasons that we don't understand,52.66,4.649,57.309,NA
sometimes we think there may be some,55.079,4.631,59.71,NA
viral illness that causes a dysfunction,57.309,5.12,62.428999999999995,NA
but it shows up in a large number of,59.71,5.54,65.25,sad
women in the middle years of their life,62.429,5.441,67.87,sad
most patients with gastric Parris's can,65.25,4.57,69.82,sad
be managed with a variety of medicines,67.87,5.88,73.75,sad
but there's some patients in whom all,69.82,6.119,75.939,sad
the medicines in the world are given to,73.75,5.34,79.09,neutral
and they continue to have debilitating,75.939,7.021,82.96,sad
nausea vomiting and frequently have,79.09,6.87,85.96000000000001,sad
weight loss which may require feeding,82.96,6.57,89.53,sad
with feeding tubes or even intravenous,85.96,6.269,92.229,sad
feeding it's possible to correct this,89.53,4.71,94.24,NA
condition when medical treatment fails,92.229,4.771,97.0,NA
with a surgical procedure which involves,94.24,5.269,99.509,NA
putting a pacemaker into the stomach,97.0,5.31,102.31,NA
similar to what you do for a heart that,99.509,4.691,104.2,NA
has a malfunction in its electrical,102.31,5.46,107.77,NA
system Medtronic has developed this,104.2,7.589,111.789,sad
system and what it is it's a small disc,107.77,6.9,114.67,sad
shape generator it has a battery in it,111.789,5.94,117.729,sad
that gets placed underneath the skin and,114.67,7.309,121.979,sad
it's connected by wires into the stomach,117.729,7.261,124.99,NA
there are two leads that get placed into,121.979,5.021,127.0,NA
the wall of the stomach and they,124.99,4.5,129.49,neutral
stimulate the electrical system of the,127.0,4.71,131.71,neutral
stomach with an intermittent pulse of,129.49,5.31,134.8,neutral
electricity in many patients this is,131.71,6.06,137.77,neutral
miraculous they may wake up from surgery,134.8,4.87,139.67000000000002,neutral
in nausea which is,137.77,4.95,142.72,neutral
and present for years is suddenly gone,139.67,6.0,145.67,sad
they are able to eat they were able to,142.72,6.76,149.48,sad
get off of feeding tubes intravenous,145.67,6.63,152.29999999999998,sad
feeding it can really be life-changing,149.48,6.99,156.47,sad
for many patients in particular young,152.3,6.75,159.05,NA
diabetics seem to do very well with this,156.47,5.43,161.9,sad
procedure because the electrical signal,159.05,6.3,165.35000000000002,sad
seems to interrupt the signals that give,161.9,8.43,170.33,sad
them nausea so that a young diabetic,165.35,8.1,173.45,sad
patient who spends his days and weeks in,170.33,5.939,176.269,sad
and out of the emergency room for poo,173.45,6.89,180.33999999999997,sad
poor blood sugar control for dehydration,176.269,7.621,183.89000000000001,sad
suddenly is able to take a diet where,180.34,6.52,186.86,sad
they can control their diabetes where,183.89,5.84,189.73,sad
they can nourish themselves by mouth and,186.86,6.629,193.489,sad
avoid the repetitive visits to emergency,189.73,7.089,196.819,sad
rooms and hospitalizations we've been,193.489,7.53,201.019,NA
doing this at MUSC for over five years,196.819,7.941,204.76,NA
that have done over a hundred patients,201.019,7.231,208.25,NA
and it doesn't work in everyone some,204.76,6.9,211.66,sad
patients it's effective immediately,208.25,6.299,214.549,sad
others it may take two to three months,211.66,5.859,217.519,NA
for the electrical architecture of the,214.549,4.981,219.53,NA
stomach to remodel so that they benefit,217.519,7.081,224.6,sad
from it the Pacers are run by a small,219.53,8.37,227.9,sad
battery and for patients who have the,224.6,6.12,230.72,sad
Pacers effective at a low setting the,227.9,5.0,232.9,sad
battery may last for six to eight years,230.72,6.21,236.93,NA
other patients require running the,232.9,6.76,239.66,NA
generator at high settings and the,236.93,5.82,242.75,NA
generators in that case may run out in a,239.66,7.049,246.709,NA
year's time sometimes even less when the,242.75,6.51,249.26,NA
battery runs out of juice it's an,246.709,5.12,251.829,NA
outpatient procedure to replace it,249.26,5.55,254.81,NA
patients come in to the hospital go to,251.829,6.31,258.139,sad
the operating room and in a 30 minute,254.81,6.899,261.709,sad
procedure we remove the generator and,258.139,6.361,264.5,NA
replace it with a new one I think,261.709,6.241,267.95,NA
the placement of a gastric stimulator,264.5,7.08,271.58,NA
can be a life-saving,267.95,7.05,275.0,sad
procedure for many patients who have not,271.58,5.369,276.94899999999996,sad
benefited from traditional medical,275.0,4.919,279.919,sad
therapy it definitely can improve the,276.949,7.171,284.12,sad
quality of life and it's a procedure,279.919,7.74,287.659,NA
that has a low complication rate low,284.12,7.41,291.53000000000003,NA
risk rate and I'm very pleased that we,287.659,6.121,293.78,NA
can offer it here in South Carolina to,291.53,4.919,296.44899999999996,sad
many patients who need it and many,293.78,4.47,298.25,sad
patients who may not be aware that it's,296.449,4.56,301.009,sad
available and that is a possible,298.25,6.21,304.46,sad
solution to what could be years of,301.009,8.31,309.319,sad
nausea vomiting malnutrition and need,304.46,7.859,312.31899999999996,sad
