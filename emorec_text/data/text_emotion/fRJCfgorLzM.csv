I'm David Adams and I'm professor of surgery at the Medical University of South Carolina and co-director of the digestive disease center I've been here for 30 years and my practice has been,5.71,22.94,28.650000000000002,angry
taking care of people with complicated disorders of their abdomen and the organs that lie inside the abdominal cavity one of the organs that can be really pain just a terrible cause of,17.5,28.81,46.31,angry
suffering is the stomach and what I'm talking about today are patients who have stomachs that stopped working for a variety of reasons we call this gastric paris's and it means paralysis of the,31.48,27.479,58.959,angry
stomach it occurs frequently in patients who have diabetes and it also occurs for reasons that we don't understand sometimes we think there may be some viral illness that causes a dysfunction,45.19,28.55,73.74,angry
but it shows up in a large number of women in the middle years of their life most patients with gastric Parris's can be managed with a variety of medicines but there's some patients in whom all,59.71,27.55,87.26,angry
the medicines in the world are given to and they continue to have debilitating nausea vomiting and frequently have weight loss which may require feeding with feeding tubes or even intravenous,73.75,32.07,105.82,angry
feeding it's possible to correct this condition when medical treatment fails with a surgical procedure which involves putting a pacemaker into the stomach similar to what you do for a heart that,89.53,24.750999999999998,114.281,angry
has a malfunction in its electrical system Medtronic has developed this system and what it is it's a small disc shape generator it has a battery in it that gets placed underneath the skin and,102.31,33.198,135.508,angry
it's connected by wires into the stomach there are two leads that get placed into the wall of the stomach and they stimulate the electrical system of the stomach with an intermittent pulse of,117.729,26.802,144.531,angry
electricity in many patients this is miraculous they may wake up from surgery in nausea which is and present for years is suddenly gone they are able to eat they were able to,131.71,28.64,160.35000000000002,angry
get off of feeding tubes intravenous feeding it can really be life-changing for many patients in particular young diabetics seem to do very well with this procedure because the electrical signal,145.67,32.1,177.76999999999998,angry
seems to interrupt the signals that give them nausea so that a young diabetic patient who spends his days and weeks in and out of the emergency room for poo poor blood sugar control for dehydration,161.9,36.980000000000004,198.88,angry
suddenly is able to take a diet where they can control their diabetes where they can nourish themselves by mouth and avoid the repetitive visits to emergency rooms and hospitalizations we've been,180.34,33.608,213.948,angry
doing this at MUSC for over five years that have done over a hundred patients and it doesn't work in everyone some patients it's effective immediately others it may take two to three months,196.819,34.230000000000004,231.04899999999998,sad
for the electrical architecture of the stomach to remodel so that they benefit from it the Pacers are run by a small battery and for patients who have the Pacers effective at a low setting the,214.549,31.552000000000003,246.101,sad
battery may last for six to eight years other patients require running the generator at high settings and the generators in that case may run out in a year's time sometimes even less when the,230.72,32.349,263.069,angry
battery runs out of juice it's an outpatient procedure to replace it patients come in to the hospital go to the operating room and in a 30 minute procedure we remove the generator and,246.709,30.240000000000002,276.949,angry
replace it with a new one I think the placement of a gastric stimulator can be a life-saving procedure for many patients who have not benefited from traditional medical,261.709,30.659,292.368,angry
therapy it definitely can improve the quality of life and it's a procedure that has a low complication rate low risk rate and I'm very pleased that we can offer it here in South Carolina to,276.949,33.361,310.31,angry
many patients who need it and many patients who may not be aware that it's available and that is a possible solution to what could be years of nausea vomiting malnutrition and need,293.78,31.409,325.18899999999996,angry
for multiple emergency room and hospital visits,309.319,7.422000000000001,316.74100000000004,angry
