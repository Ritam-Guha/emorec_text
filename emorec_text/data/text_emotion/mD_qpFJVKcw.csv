so acromegaly is a disease,2.159,4.401,6.56,happy
primarily caused by pituitary tumors,4.16,4.64,8.8,happy
that secrete growth hormone,6.56,3.999,10.559,happy
i think we all know that when you're a,8.8,3.839,12.639000000000001,happy
child or a teenager and you're growing,10.559,6.401,16.96,happy
taller you need growth hormone to grow,12.639,6.48,19.119,happy
but even as an adult your body still,16.96,3.68,20.64,happy
makes growth hormone and it seems to be,19.119,2.961,22.08,happy
important for,20.64,3.52,24.16,happy
maintaining things like skeletal muscle,22.08,5.76,27.839999999999996,happy
and strength and energy and fatigue,24.16,3.68,27.84,fear
and preventing fatigue and things like,28.24,4.88,33.12,fear
that um so that's a normal,29.679,4.72,34.399,happy
part of the pituitary gland there are,33.12,3.92,37.04,happy
cells that secrete growth hormone,34.399,6.0,40.399,happy
um and acromegaly arises when when,37.04,6.88,43.92,happy
those cells develop into a tumor,40.399,5.041,45.44,happy
these tumors are are located in the,43.92,3.119,47.039,happy
pituitary gland which is a,45.44,3.52,48.96,happy
small gland kind of off the base of the,47.039,4.081,51.120000000000005,happy
brain that really sits sort of behind,48.96,3.84,52.8,happy
the behind the nose or behind the eyes,51.12,4.88,56.0,happy
is where it's actually located,52.8,3.2,56.0,happy
and when uh,56.879,5.84,62.718999999999994,happy
these tumors form and by the way they're,60.399,3.921,64.32000000000001,happy
benign tumors almost always they're,62.719,3.601,66.32000000000001,happy
almost never cancers,64.32,3.92,68.24,happy
uh they're benign tumors but but they,66.32,3.04,69.36,happy
cause problems because they make,68.24,2.239,70.479,happy
hormones,69.36,3.439,72.799,happy
um and what happens when the body as an,70.479,3.121,73.6,happy
adult,72.799,3.36,76.159,happy
um has too much growth hormone there are,73.6,4.96,78.55999999999999,fear
parts of the body that can still grow,76.159,4.561,80.72,fear
so for example mostly cartilage so so,78.56,4.4,82.96000000000001,happy
the nose the ears,80.72,4.0,84.72,happy
um some and some of the bones like in,82.96,3.36,86.32,happy
the feet and the hands can,84.72,4.48,89.2,happy
still grow so you'll see people that,86.32,5.36,91.67999999999999,happy
have acromegaly have very,89.2,4.48,93.68,happy
large ears they didn't have very,91.68,3.759,95.43900000000001,happy
prominent sort of brow,93.68,5.2,98.88000000000001,happy
brow ridges and also the chin is is,95.439,5.36,100.79899999999999,happy
another part of the body that that still,98.88,3.519,102.399,
grows typically people,100.799,4.801,105.60000000000001,
even when they're adults um,102.399,4.4,106.799,happy
and these are some of the features and,105.6,2.799,108.399,happy
the other the other thing that that we,106.799,2.081,108.88000000000001,happy
see,108.399,1.521,109.92,disgust
frequently in adults that have,108.88,3.68,112.56,happy
acromegaly is is uh growth of the hands,109.92,4.559,114.479,happy
and the feet so for for people that wear,112.56,2.879,115.43900000000001,happy
rings,114.479,2.24,116.719,
they'll notice a change in their ring,115.439,3.121,118.55999999999999,fear
size or people often notice a change in,116.719,3.281,120.0,fear
their shoe size,118.56,2.8,121.36,fear
um and you know it's more than just,120.0,2.88,122.88,happy
going from one brand to shoe to the,121.36,2.96,124.32,happy
other brand or shoe that you know your,122.88,2.879,125.759,happy
size may change but,124.32,3.52,127.83999999999999,happy
if you're wearing the same shoe and it's,125.759,3.92,129.679,happy
growing over time,127.84,3.199,131.03900000000002,angry
that may that may be a sign of,129.679,3.841,133.52,fear
acromegaly um obviously,131.039,5.28,136.319,happy
if if a child has acromegaly before,133.52,4.16,137.68,happy
they've reached their full adult height,136.319,2.0,138.319,angry
they'll,137.68,2.639,140.31900000000002,angry
continue to grow taller and that's why,138.319,4.161,142.48,happy
you have people that are that are giants,140.319,5.201,145.51999999999998,happy
um actually can be due to to acromegaly,142.48,5.04,147.51999999999998,happy
uh people like like andre the giant was,145.52,4.32,149.84,neutral
a was very very well known and actor,147.52,3.52,151.04000000000002,neutral
richard keel,149.84,4.32,154.16,neutral
um also had uh had acromegaly the guy,151.04,4.64,155.67999999999998,happy
who played jaws in many of the james,154.16,1.84,156.0,happy
bond,155.68,3.6,159.28,happy
films um usually the diagnosis,156.0,6.72,162.72,happy
is made by an endocrinologist um,159.28,5.76,165.04,happy
often someone that has you know some,162.72,5.04,167.76,happy
expertise in pituitary diseases but but,165.04,4.32,169.35999999999999,happy
you know most endocrinologists are,167.76,3.52,171.28,fear
familiar with the condition,169.36,4.48,173.84,happy
um you know sometimes you see a very,171.28,4.0,175.28,happy
very astute uh,173.84,3.52,177.36,happy
a primary care doctor can can suspect,175.28,3.599,178.879,happy
the diagnosis and often can start the,177.36,2.32,179.68,happy
work up,178.879,2.241,181.12,happy
the other thing that we sometimes see is,179.68,3.44,183.12,happy
actually uh dentists actually make the,181.12,3.92,185.04,
that can make the diagnosis or suggest a,183.12,3.199,186.31900000000002,neutral
diagnosis because one of the other,185.04,3.04,188.07999999999998,neutral
things that happens is that,186.319,3.2,189.51899999999998,neutral
because the jaw can grow a little bit,188.08,3.2,191.28,neutral
the teeth,189.519,3.44,192.959,
patient teeth tend to start to spread a,191.28,3.679,194.959,happy
little bit and i've seen,192.959,4.881,197.84,happy
i i've seen that happen where where,194.959,4.0,198.959,happy
someone sent to me by,197.84,4.16,202.0,happy
by a um by a dentist with a with,198.959,6.321,205.28,fear
either the diagnosis made or or a strong,202.0,4.319,206.319,fear
suspicion,205.28,2.879,208.159,fear
that that's what the patient has,206.319,4.0,210.319,
specific thing that i've seen is,208.159,3.921,212.07999999999998,happy
is the changes in shoe size and ring,210.319,3.041,213.35999999999999,happy
size,212.08,3.12,215.20000000000002,happy
um a lot of the other things are are,213.36,3.519,216.87900000000002,happy
much more subtle,215.2,3.36,218.56,
um and i think the other thing that,216.879,3.28,220.159,
that's actually really helpful for,218.56,2.88,221.44,
people is if,220.159,4.401,224.56,NA
a patient has a you know old photograph,221.44,4.4,225.84,NA
of themselves from you know five or ten,224.56,2.56,227.12,NA
years ago whether the truth has a,225.84,3.2,229.04,NA
driver's license or,227.12,3.44,230.56,NA
you know a picture with friends or,229.04,3.44,232.48,NA
whatever now we all carry around our,230.56,3.52,234.08,NA
cell phones which which have many years,232.48,1.839,234.319,NA
of,234.08,3.28,237.36,NA
photos on them at least for most people,234.319,5.12,239.439,NA
and and often the physical changes if,237.36,3.12,240.48000000000002,NA
you look,239.439,3.841,243.28,NA
um you can see them um you know,240.48,4.88,245.35999999999999,NA
obviously we all change as we get older,243.28,5.36,248.64000000000001,NA
um but particularly the prominence of,245.36,3.599,248.959,NA
the,248.64,3.36,252.0,NA
of the the chin and the brow line,248.959,5.601,254.56,NA
and the coarseness of the features are,252.0,3.92,255.92,NA
something that can actually be,254.56,9.6,264.16,NA
be noticed if you're looking for it,255.92,8.24,264.15999999999997,NA
