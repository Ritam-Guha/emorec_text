so acromegaly is a disease,2.159,4.401,6.56,sad
primarily caused by pituitary tumors,4.16,4.64,8.8,sad
that secrete growth hormone,6.56,3.999,10.559,sad
i think we all know that when you're a,8.8,3.839,12.639000000000001,sad
child or a teenager and you're growing,10.559,6.401,16.96,sad
taller you need growth hormone to grow,12.639,6.48,19.119,sad
but even as an adult your body still,16.96,3.68,20.64,sad
makes growth hormone and it seems to be,19.119,2.961,22.08,sad
important for,20.64,3.52,24.16,sad
maintaining things like skeletal muscle,22.08,5.76,27.839999999999996,sad
and strength and energy and fatigue,24.16,3.68,27.84,sad
and preventing fatigue and things like,28.24,4.88,33.12,sad
that um so that's a normal,29.679,4.72,34.399,sad
part of the pituitary gland there are,33.12,3.92,37.04,sad
cells that secrete growth hormone,34.399,6.0,40.399,sad
um and acromegaly arises when when,37.04,6.88,43.92,sad
those cells develop into a tumor,40.399,5.041,45.44,sad
these tumors are are located in the,43.92,3.119,47.039,sad
pituitary gland which is a,45.44,3.52,48.96,sad
small gland kind of off the base of the,47.039,4.081,51.120000000000005,sad
brain that really sits sort of behind,48.96,3.84,52.8,sad
the behind the nose or behind the eyes,51.12,4.88,56.0,surprise
is where it's actually located,52.8,3.2,56.0,fear
and when uh,56.879,5.84,62.718999999999994,sad
these tumors form and by the way they're,60.399,3.921,64.32000000000001,sad
benign tumors almost always they're,62.719,3.601,66.32000000000001,fear
almost never cancers,64.32,3.92,68.24,sad
uh they're benign tumors but but they,66.32,3.04,69.36,sad
cause problems because they make,68.24,2.239,70.479,sad
hormones,69.36,3.439,72.799,sad
um and what happens when the body as an,70.479,3.121,73.6,sad
adult,72.799,3.36,76.159,sad
um has too much growth hormone there are,73.6,4.96,78.55999999999999,sad
parts of the body that can still grow,76.159,4.561,80.72,sad
so for example mostly cartilage so so,78.56,4.4,82.96000000000001,neutral
the nose the ears,80.72,4.0,84.72,fear
um some and some of the bones like in,82.96,3.36,86.32,fear
the feet and the hands can,84.72,4.48,89.2,fear
still grow so you'll see people that,86.32,5.36,91.67999999999999,neutral
have acromegaly have very,89.2,4.48,93.68,sad
large ears they didn't have very,91.68,3.759,95.43900000000001,sad
prominent sort of brow,93.68,5.2,98.88000000000001,sad
brow ridges and also the chin is is,95.439,5.36,100.79899999999999,sad
another part of the body that that still,98.88,3.519,102.399,sad
grows typically people,100.799,4.801,105.60000000000001,sad
even when they're adults um,102.399,4.4,106.799,neutral
and these are some of the features and,105.6,2.799,108.399,sad
the other the other thing that that we,106.799,2.081,108.88000000000001,sad
see,108.399,1.521,109.92,sad
frequently in adults that have,108.88,3.68,112.56,sad
acromegaly is is uh growth of the hands,109.92,4.559,114.479,sad
and the feet so for for people that wear,112.56,2.879,115.43900000000001,angry
rings,114.479,2.24,116.719,angry
they'll notice a change in their ring,115.439,3.121,118.55999999999999,fear
size or people often notice a change in,116.719,3.281,120.0,sad
their shoe size,118.56,2.8,121.36,sad
um and you know it's more than just,120.0,2.88,122.88,sad
going from one brand to shoe to the,121.36,2.96,124.32,sad
other brand or shoe that you know your,122.88,2.879,125.759,sad
size may change but,124.32,3.52,127.83999999999999,fear
if you're wearing the same shoe and it's,125.759,3.92,129.679,sad
growing over time,127.84,3.199,131.03900000000002,sad
that may that may be a sign of,129.679,3.841,133.52,sad
acromegaly um obviously,131.039,5.28,136.319,sad
if if a child has acromegaly before,133.52,4.16,137.68,neutral
they've reached their full adult height,136.319,2.0,138.319,sad
they'll,137.68,2.639,140.31900000000002,sad
continue to grow taller and that's why,138.319,4.161,142.48,sad
you have people that are that are giants,140.319,5.201,145.51999999999998,sad
um actually can be due to to acromegaly,142.48,5.04,147.51999999999998,sad
uh people like like andre the giant was,145.52,4.32,149.84,sad
a was very very well known and actor,147.52,3.52,151.04000000000002,sad
richard keel,149.84,4.32,154.16,sad
um also had uh had acromegaly the guy,151.04,4.64,155.67999999999998,sad
who played jaws in many of the james,154.16,1.84,156.0,sad
bond,155.68,3.6,159.28,sad
films um usually the diagnosis,156.0,6.72,162.72,sad
is made by an endocrinologist um,159.28,5.76,165.04,sad
often someone that has you know some,162.72,5.04,167.76,sad
expertise in pituitary diseases but but,165.04,4.32,169.35999999999999,fear
you know most endocrinologists are,167.76,3.52,171.28,sad
familiar with the condition,169.36,4.48,173.84,sad
um you know sometimes you see a very,171.28,4.0,175.28,fear
very astute uh,173.84,3.52,177.36,sad
a primary care doctor can can suspect,175.28,3.599,178.879,sad
the diagnosis and often can start the,177.36,2.32,179.68,sad
work up,178.879,2.241,181.12,sad
the other thing that we sometimes see is,179.68,3.44,183.12,sad
actually uh dentists actually make the,181.12,3.92,185.04,sad
that can make the diagnosis or suggest a,183.12,3.199,186.31900000000002,sad
diagnosis because one of the other,185.04,3.04,188.07999999999998,sad
things that happens is that,186.319,3.2,189.51899999999998,sad
because the jaw can grow a little bit,188.08,3.2,191.28,sad
the teeth,189.519,3.44,192.959,sad
patient teeth tend to start to spread a,191.28,3.679,194.959,sad
little bit and i've seen,192.959,4.881,197.84,sad
i i've seen that happen where where,194.959,4.0,198.959,angry
someone sent to me by,197.84,4.16,202.0,fear
by a um by a dentist with a with,198.959,6.321,205.28,sad
either the diagnosis made or or a strong,202.0,4.319,206.319,sad
suspicion,205.28,2.879,208.159,sad
that that's what the patient has,206.319,4.0,210.319,sad
specific thing that i've seen is,208.159,3.921,212.07999999999998,sad
is the changes in shoe size and ring,210.319,3.041,213.35999999999999,NA
size,212.08,3.12,215.20000000000002,sad
um a lot of the other things are are,213.36,3.519,216.87900000000002,sad
much more subtle,215.2,3.36,218.56,sad
um and i think the other thing that,216.879,3.28,220.159,NA
that's actually really helpful for,218.56,2.88,221.44,NA
people is if,220.159,4.401,224.56,NA
a patient has a you know old photograph,221.44,4.4,225.84,NA
of themselves from you know five or ten,224.56,2.56,227.12,NA
years ago whether the truth has a,225.84,3.2,229.04,NA
driver's license or,227.12,3.44,230.56,NA
you know a picture with friends or,229.04,3.44,232.48,NA
whatever now we all carry around our,230.56,3.52,234.08,NA
cell phones which which have many years,232.48,1.839,234.319,NA
of,234.08,3.28,237.36,NA
photos on them at least for most people,234.319,5.12,239.439,NA
and and often the physical changes if,237.36,3.12,240.48000000000002,NA
you look,239.439,3.841,243.28,NA
um you can see them um you know,240.48,4.88,245.35999999999999,NA
obviously we all change as we get older,243.28,5.36,248.64000000000001,NA
um but particularly the prominence of,245.36,3.599,248.959,NA
the,248.64,3.36,252.0,NA
of the the chin and the brow line,248.959,5.601,254.56,NA
and the coarseness of the features are,252.0,3.92,255.92,NA
something that can actually be,254.56,9.6,264.16,NA
be noticed if you're looking for it,255.92,8.24,264.15999999999997,NA
