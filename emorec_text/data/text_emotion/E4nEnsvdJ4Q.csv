diabetes symptoms in men so let's stay,28.08,3.999,32.079,neutral
tuned and watch this video all over,30.32,4.48,34.8,fear
through so type 2 diabetes or other type,32.079,4.721,36.8,fear
of diabetes are not that much,34.8,4.16,38.959999999999994,fear
symptomatic but still if you want to,36.8,4.0,40.8,neutral
understand what are the symptoms here we,38.96,3.2,42.160000000000004,neutral
go these are the symptoms that are,40.8,3.68,44.48,neutral
listed but actually there are diabetes,42.16,5.28,47.44,neutral
symptoms common for men and women both,44.48,4.8,49.279999999999994,neutral
these cases there are common symptoms,47.44,3.76,51.199999999999996,neutral
and these are all among those common,49.28,3.84,53.120000000000005,fear
symptoms that are found both in men as,51.2,3.359,54.559000000000005,fear
well as in women,53.12,3.04,56.16,neutral
but there are other symptoms and the,54.559,4.0,58.559,neutral
variations slides some of the symptoms,56.16,5.12,61.279999999999994,neutral
are more common in men than women so we,58.559,4.8,63.358999999999995,fear
are going to talk about them as well so,61.28,4.4,65.68,fear
begin with the common symptoms let's say,63.359,4.161,67.52,fear
first of all the diabetes symptom number,65.68,4.16,69.84,neutral
one is urination frequent urination you,67.52,4.0,71.52,neutral
need to go to the bathroom quite often,69.84,3.52,73.36,neutral
mostly in the night times even after the,71.52,3.76,75.28,neutral
meal you know blood glucose level is too,73.36,4.48,77.84,neutral
high and your kidneys working too hard,75.28,4.4,79.68,neutral
to take that glucose out of the body,77.84,3.68,81.52000000000001,neutral
that's why they produce more and more,79.68,4.64,84.32000000000001,neutral
urine and put it outside now as it is,81.52,5.44,86.96,neutral
excluding those uh sugar out of your,84.32,4.56,88.88,neutral
body it is also excluding the water from,86.96,3.76,90.72,neutral
your body so you need to take a lot,88.88,4.64,93.52,neutral
water after that so increased thrust is,90.72,5.28,96.0,neutral
also related with this urination second,93.52,4.48,98.0,neutral
thing is a fatty you feel very much,96.0,4.0,100.0,neutral
tired all the time and too much,98.0,3.6,101.6,neutral
irritated about small things in your,100.0,3.68,103.68,neutral
life this can be a result this can be a,101.6,4.4,106.0,neutral
symptom of many disease but it is also,103.68,4.719,108.399,neutral
related symptom for diabetes in men,106.0,4.64,110.64,neutral
second thing a third one is the hunger,108.399,3.281,111.68,neutral
so,110.64,3.2,113.84,neutral
diabetes symptoms in men hunger is very,111.68,4.32,116.0,neutral
common and even after eating something,113.84,4.0,117.84,neutral
right it's kind of weird right you eat,116.0,3.759,119.759,neutral
something and you feel hungry more,117.84,3.44,121.28,neutral
because of you know after eating,119.759,3.04,122.799,neutral
something your blood glucose level goes,121.28,4.08,125.36,neutral
too high it causes the hunger more,122.799,4.32,127.119,neutral
because you know inside the cell as a,125.36,3.84,129.2,neutral
result of diabetes the cell will not,127.119,4.081,131.2,neutral
receive that glucose due to the less,129.2,3.6,132.79999999999998,neutral
amount of insulin that is a hormone,131.2,3.36,134.56,neutral
which controls the balance of this,132.8,3.84,136.64000000000001,neutral
glucose in your body and cell won't get,134.56,4.24,138.8,neutral
it so cell try to get more and more food,136.64,3.52,140.16,neutral
more and more glucose you feel more,138.8,2.32,141.12,neutral
hungry,140.16,3.52,143.68,neutral
kind of weird then we have bloody vision,141.12,4.64,145.76,neutral
bloody vision means you know due to the,143.68,4.559,148.239,neutral
production of high glucose level in your,145.76,3.6,149.35999999999999,neutral
blood,148.239,3.761,152.0,neutral
what happens actually uh it kind of uh,149.36,4.56,153.92000000000002,neutral
make your lens you know islands that you,152.0,3.84,155.84,neutral
can see here the lens start to distort,153.92,4.0,157.92,neutral
as a result you feel blurred vision not,155.84,3.44,159.28,neutral
a good sign,157.92,3.679,161.599,neutral
then the diabetes symptom number five,159.28,4.16,163.44,neutral
that is slow healing source if you have,161.599,4.161,165.76,neutral
small wounds in your hand or leg,163.44,4.799,168.239,neutral
whatever it is it might take a long time,165.76,4.72,170.48,neutral
to heal so these are kind of common,168.239,4.64,172.879,neutral
symptoms that we can find both in men as,170.48,4.399,174.879,neutral
well as women during the type 2 diabetes,172.879,4.161,177.04,neutral
conditions or pre-diabetic conditions,174.879,4.0,178.879,neutral
but there are some specific things for,177.04,4.24,181.28,neutral
male and more common for male for,178.879,5.121,184.0,neutral
example infections infections also are,181.28,4.319,185.599,neutral
kind of seen in men and women but,184.0,3.599,187.599,happy
different kinds of infection infections,185.599,4.0,189.599,neutral
in genitalia is pretty much common,187.599,3.681,191.28,neutral
because a certain kind of you know urine,189.599,3.36,192.959,neutral
infection is very much common during the,191.28,4.4,195.68,neutral
time because it was kind of uh in the,192.959,4.161,197.12,neutral
studies that,195.68,3.839,199.519,neutral
during this high blood sugar level what,197.12,3.839,200.959,neutral
happens uh,199.519,3.281,202.8,neutral
the strategy of your body to fight,200.959,2.881,203.84,neutral
against the infection that is the,202.8,3.12,205.92000000000002,neutral
immunity of our body kind of goes down,203.84,3.52,207.36,neutral
that's why infections are pretty much,205.92,4.16,210.07999999999998,neutral
common then so that thing is another uh,207.36,4.799,212.15900000000002,neutral
part and another important thing about,210.08,4.799,214.87900000000002,neutral
the main particularly main uh symptoms,212.159,5.521,217.67999999999998,neutral
for diabetes are you know you have kind,214.879,5.201,220.07999999999998,neutral
of genital thrash all the time it's kind,217.68,4.4,222.08,neutral
of weird thing and you have swelling,220.08,4.159,224.239,neutral
around the penis and these are the,222.08,3.439,225.519,neutral
different things that you are going to,224.239,3.601,227.84,neutral
witness alongside your genitalia it's,225.519,4.8,230.31900000000002,neutral
kind of weird but it happens for women,227.84,4.88,232.72,neutral
also they witness kind of yeast,230.319,4.401,234.72,neutral
infections are very much common then,232.72,3.36,236.08,neutral
so these are,234.72,4.64,239.35999999999999,neutral
the symptoms of diabetes in men so yeast,236.08,5.84,241.92000000000002,neutral
infections more common in female but for,239.36,4.799,244.15900000000002,neutral
the men we have the increased genital,241.92,3.76,245.67999999999998,neutral
thrush and also,244.159,4.72,248.879,neutral
uh certain problems regarding your,245.68,5.36,251.04000000000002,neutral
genitalia like the swelling uh,248.879,3.601,252.48,neutral
surrounding the penis and all these,251.04,3.839,254.879,neutral
things so other specific symptoms for,252.48,4.719,257.199,neutral
diabetes in men includes you know apple,254.879,3.6,258.479,neutral
shaped bodies,257.199,2.88,260.079,neutral
what is that thing,258.479,3.841,262.32,neutral
i even don't uh think it apple chipped,260.079,4.161,264.24,neutral
