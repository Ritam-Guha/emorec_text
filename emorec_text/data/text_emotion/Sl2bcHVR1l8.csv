peripheral neuropathy is a painful condition which affects the extremities it is a type of nerve pain or neuropathic pain where there's damage and/or dysfunction to an element to the,12.719,24.591,37.31,angry
nervous system which leads to hypersensitivity how does that translate well patients will come along and generally speaking the peripheral neuropathy will be in their feet feet,25.68,27.12,52.8,angry
and ankles and patients will describe nerve type pain so they may have burning sharp lancinating really unpleasant types of pain electric shock like pains that sort of thing,38.73,32.939,71.669,angry
when you assess the patient's we need to find out is there an obvious cause for their peripheral neuropathy the major things we're looking for in a patient's history are of a diabetic is one of the,54.829,28.689999999999998,83.519,angry
number-one ones and actually sometimes diabetes presents with peripheral neuropathy so it needs to be excluded does the patient have a vitamin deficiency a b12 deficiency is quite,69.84,27.871,97.711,angry
common are there any other causes for the neuropathy if they had trauma to the feet surgery that sort of thing or do they have vascular insufficiency is another significant cause it's a very,83.7,32.46,116.16,angry
painful unpleasant complaint and once we've assessed the patient we will do a full history and examination the history will consist of a pain questionnaire which we send out and we look at the,98.07,31.98,130.04999999999998,angry
characteristics of the pain site character duration radiation aggravating relieving associated factors we'll look at the previous treatments that the patient has had and any investigations,116.13,24.62,140.75,angry
that they've had and then we can assess the condition as fully as possible now it's very important when patients have peripheral neuropathy to find out if there is an underlying cause to that as,127.65,30.929,158.579,angry
we've previously discussed that's will usually require further investigations usually blood tests or radiological investigations such as MRI scans to find out is there an underlying,143.819,27.970000000000002,171.789,angry
cause because that needs to be tackled first then we will move on to how do we actually improve this patient symptoms when we're dealing with peripheral neuropathy as I mentioned before it is a,157.28,31.741,189.02100000000002,angry
type of neuropathic pain or nerve pain the mainstay of treatment for all types of neuropathic pain is medication and the medications that we use are called anti neuropathic medications they all,173.54,31.060000000000002,204.6,angry
tend to have started off life treating other things so we use anti-epileptics we use antidepressants we use anti-arrhythmic medications and the general principle is to use small,189.23,26.97,216.2,angry
amounts of the medication to slowly escalate the dose and to balance benefits in terms of pain relief with any side effects that the patient may experience always always optimizing,202.76,36.179,238.939,angry
medication is the most important treatment option we do have other treatment options beyond that for example we can do pulsed radio frequency treatment which I will speak about in,220.909,28.560000000000002,249.469,angry
another video we also have advanced pain management treatments and we can offer spinal cord stimulation and dorsal root ganglion stimulation now these are advanced treatments and these are only,234.5,28.22,262.72,angry
suggesting once all the usual treatment options have been explored the other thing that we do with patients with peripheral neuropathy firstly we need to break the cycle of the pain improve the,248.5,27.851,276.351,angry
pain and get the symptoms under control as much as possible but we do need to rehabilitate the patient as well and that will be physical rehabilitation usually under the care of one of our,263.27,25.469,288.739,NA
pain physiotherapists and that Willing in Kali dude strengthening training aerobic training but also forward peripheral neuropathy we teach desensitization,275.719,23.29,299.009,NA
exercises now these are external physical treatments which the patient can do themselves on a daily basis and they're there to try and retrain the skin and to try and help reduce the,287.36,28.651,316.011,NA
overall pain levels,301.11,3.74,304.85,NA
