peripheral neuropathy is a painful,12.719,6.091,18.81,fear
condition which affects the extremities,16.08,5.16,21.24,
it is a type of nerve pain or,18.81,4.65,23.46,fear
neuropathic pain where there's damage,21.24,4.44,25.68,fear
and/or dysfunction to an element to the,23.46,4.25,27.71,fear
nervous system which leads to,25.68,4.95,30.63,happy
hypersensitivity how does that translate,27.71,5.939,33.649,fear
well patients will come along and,30.63,5.58,36.21,fear
generally speaking the peripheral,33.649,5.081,38.730000000000004,angry
neuropathy will be in their feet feet,36.21,5.57,41.78,angry
and ankles and patients will describe,38.73,6.62,45.349999999999994,angry
nerve type pain so they may have burning,41.78,8.049,49.829,angry
sharp lancinating really unpleasant,45.35,7.419,52.769,angry
types of pain electric shock like pains,49.829,5.0,54.829,angry
that sort of thing,52.769,5.851,58.62,angry
when you assess the patient's we need to,54.829,6.49,61.319,angry
find out is there an obvious cause for,58.62,5.189,63.809,angry
their peripheral neuropathy the major,61.319,4.861,66.18,angry
things we're looking for in a patient's,63.809,6.031,69.84,angry
history are of a diabetic is one of the,66.18,6.119,72.299,angry
number-one ones and actually sometimes,69.84,5.34,75.18,angry
diabetes presents with peripheral,72.299,5.751,78.05000000000001,angry
neuropathy so it needs to be excluded,75.18,5.97,81.15,angry
does the patient have a vitamin,78.05,5.65,83.7,angry
deficiency a b12 deficiency is quite,81.15,5.16,86.31,angry
common are there any other causes for,83.7,5.34,89.04,angry
the neuropathy if they had trauma to the,86.31,6.15,92.46000000000001,angry
feet surgery that sort of thing or do,89.04,5.43,94.47,
they have vascular insufficiency is,92.46,5.61,98.07,angry
another significant cause it's a very,94.47,9.93,104.4,angry
painful unpleasant complaint and once,98.07,9.69,107.75999999999999,angry
we've assessed the patient we will do a,104.4,7.56,111.96000000000001,angry
full history and examination the history,107.76,5.94,113.7,angry
will consist of a pain questionnaire,111.96,4.17,116.13,angry
which we send out and we look at the,113.7,4.62,118.32000000000001,angry
characteristics of the pain site,116.13,4.5,120.63,angry
character duration radiation aggravating,118.32,4.71,123.02999999999999,angry
relieving associated factors we'll look,120.63,3.9,124.53,happy
at the previous treatments that the,123.03,4.62,127.65,angry
patient has had and any investigations,124.53,6.89,131.42,angry
that they've had and then we can assess,127.65,7.29,134.94,fear
the condition as fully as possible now,131.42,5.91,137.32999999999998,happy
it's very important when patients have,134.94,5.7,140.64,angry
peripheral neuropathy to find out if,137.33,6.489,143.81900000000002,angry
there is an underlying cause to that as,140.64,5.54,146.17999999999998,angry
we've previously discussed,143.819,4.51,148.32899999999998,angry
that's will usually require further,146.18,5.009,151.18900000000002,angry
investigations usually blood tests or,148.329,5.351,153.68,angry
radiological investigations such as MRI,151.189,6.091,157.28,angry
scans to find out is there an underlying,153.68,7.009,160.68900000000002,angry
cause because that needs to be tackled,157.28,8.28,165.56,angry
first then we will move on to how do we,160.689,7.651,168.34,angry
actually improve this patient symptoms,165.56,5.31,170.87,
when we're dealing with peripheral,168.34,5.2,173.54,
neuropathy as I mentioned before it is a,170.87,5.3,176.17000000000002,
type of neuropathic pain or nerve pain,173.54,6.27,179.81,angry
the mainstay of treatment for all types,176.17,6.789,182.95899999999997,angry
of neuropathic pain is medication and,179.81,5.66,185.47,angry
the medications that we use are called,182.959,6.271,189.23,angry
anti neuropathic medications they all,185.47,6.07,191.54,angry
tend to have started off life treating,189.23,4.229,193.459,
other things so we use anti-epileptics,191.54,4.02,195.56,angry
we use antidepressants we use,193.459,5.61,199.06900000000002,angry
anti-arrhythmic medications and the,195.56,7.2,202.76,angry
general principle is to use small,199.069,5.911,204.98,angry
amounts of the medication to slowly,202.76,6.02,208.78,angry
escalate the dose and to balance,204.98,7.649,212.629,angry
benefits in terms of pain relief with,208.78,6.789,215.569,angry
any side effects that the patient may,212.629,8.28,220.909,angry
experience always always optimizing,215.569,7.441,223.01,angry
medication is the most important,220.909,5.64,226.54899999999998,angry
treatment option we do have other,223.01,6.3,229.31,angry
treatment options beyond that for,226.549,5.671,232.22,angry
example we can do pulsed radio frequency,229.31,5.19,234.5,angry
treatment which I will speak about in,232.22,5.759,237.97899999999998,angry
another video we also have advanced pain,234.5,5.97,240.47,fear
management treatments and we can offer,237.979,5.79,243.769,fear
spinal cord stimulation and dorsal root,240.47,5.729,246.199,angry
ganglion stimulation now these are,243.769,4.731,248.5,angry
advanced treatments and these are only,246.199,6.0,252.199,angry
suggesting once all the usual treatment,248.5,7.599,256.099,angry
options have been explored the other,252.199,5.76,257.959,angry
thing that we do with patients with,256.099,4.89,260.989,
peripheral neuropathy firstly we need to,257.959,5.311,263.27,
break the cycle of the pain improve the,260.989,4.291,265.28,NA
pain and get the symptoms under control,263.27,5.04,268.31,NA
as much as possible but we do need to,265.28,6.03,271.30999999999995,NA
rehabilitate the patient as well and,268.31,5.3,273.61,NA
that will be physical rehabilitation,271.31,4.409,275.719,NA
usually under the care of one of our,273.61,4.69,278.3,NA
pain physiotherapists and that Willing,275.719,3.371,279.09,NA
in Kali,278.3,2.92,281.22,NA
dude strengthening training aerobic,279.09,5.34,284.42999999999995,NA
training but also forward peripheral,281.22,6.14,287.36,NA
neuropathy we teach desensitization,284.43,5.519,289.949,NA
exercises now these are external,287.36,5.71,293.07,NA
physical treatments which the patient,289.949,6.03,295.979,NA
can do themselves on a daily basis and,293.07,5.46,298.53,NA
they're there to try and retrain the,295.979,5.131,301.11,NA
skin and to try and help reduce the,298.53,6.32,304.84999999999997,NA
overall pain levels,301.11,3.74,304.85,NA
