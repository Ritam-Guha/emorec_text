peripheral neuropathy is a painful,12.719,6.091,18.81,fear
condition which affects the extremities,16.08,5.16,21.24,neutral
it is a type of nerve pain or,18.81,4.65,23.46,neutral
neuropathic pain where there's damage,21.24,4.44,25.68,neutral
and/or dysfunction to an element to the,23.46,4.25,27.71,neutral
nervous system which leads to,25.68,4.95,30.63,neutral
hypersensitivity how does that translate,27.71,5.939,33.649,neutral
well patients will come along and,30.63,5.58,36.21,neutral
generally speaking the peripheral,33.649,5.081,38.730000000000004,neutral
neuropathy will be in their feet feet,36.21,5.57,41.78,neutral
and ankles and patients will describe,38.73,6.62,45.349999999999994,neutral
nerve type pain so they may have burning,41.78,8.049,49.829,neutral
sharp lancinating really unpleasant,45.35,7.419,52.769,sad
types of pain electric shock like pains,49.829,5.0,54.829,sad
that sort of thing,52.769,5.851,58.62,sad
when you assess the patient's we need to,54.829,6.49,61.319,sad
find out is there an obvious cause for,58.62,5.189,63.809,neutral
their peripheral neuropathy the major,61.319,4.861,66.18,neutral
things we're looking for in a patient's,63.809,6.031,69.84,neutral
history are of a diabetic is one of the,66.18,6.119,72.299,neutral
number-one ones and actually sometimes,69.84,5.34,75.18,neutral
diabetes presents with peripheral,72.299,5.751,78.05000000000001,neutral
neuropathy so it needs to be excluded,75.18,5.97,81.15,neutral
does the patient have a vitamin,78.05,5.65,83.7,neutral
deficiency a b12 deficiency is quite,81.15,5.16,86.31,sad
common are there any other causes for,83.7,5.34,89.04,neutral
the neuropathy if they had trauma to the,86.31,6.15,92.46000000000001,neutral
feet surgery that sort of thing or do,89.04,5.43,94.47,neutral
they have vascular insufficiency is,92.46,5.61,98.07,neutral
another significant cause it's a very,94.47,9.93,104.4,neutral
painful unpleasant complaint and once,98.07,9.69,107.75999999999999,neutral
we've assessed the patient we will do a,104.4,7.56,111.96000000000001,neutral
full history and examination the history,107.76,5.94,113.7,neutral
will consist of a pain questionnaire,111.96,4.17,116.13,neutral
which we send out and we look at the,113.7,4.62,118.32000000000001,neutral
characteristics of the pain site,116.13,4.5,120.63,neutral
character duration radiation aggravating,118.32,4.71,123.02999999999999,neutral
relieving associated factors we'll look,120.63,3.9,124.53,neutral
at the previous treatments that the,123.03,4.62,127.65,neutral
patient has had and any investigations,124.53,6.89,131.42,neutral
that they've had and then we can assess,127.65,7.29,134.94,neutral
the condition as fully as possible now,131.42,5.91,137.32999999999998,sad
it's very important when patients have,134.94,5.7,140.64,neutral
peripheral neuropathy to find out if,137.33,6.489,143.81900000000002,neutral
there is an underlying cause to that as,140.64,5.54,146.17999999999998,neutral
we've previously discussed,143.819,4.51,148.32899999999998,neutral
that's will usually require further,146.18,5.009,151.18900000000002,neutral
investigations usually blood tests or,148.329,5.351,153.68,neutral
radiological investigations such as MRI,151.189,6.091,157.28,neutral
scans to find out is there an underlying,153.68,7.009,160.68900000000002,neutral
cause because that needs to be tackled,157.28,8.28,165.56,neutral
first then we will move on to how do we,160.689,7.651,168.34,neutral
actually improve this patient symptoms,165.56,5.31,170.87,neutral
when we're dealing with peripheral,168.34,5.2,173.54,neutral
neuropathy as I mentioned before it is a,170.87,5.3,176.17000000000002,neutral
type of neuropathic pain or nerve pain,173.54,6.27,179.81,neutral
the mainstay of treatment for all types,176.17,6.789,182.95899999999997,neutral
of neuropathic pain is medication and,179.81,5.66,185.47,neutral
the medications that we use are called,182.959,6.271,189.23,neutral
anti neuropathic medications they all,185.47,6.07,191.54,neutral
tend to have started off life treating,189.23,4.229,193.459,neutral
other things so we use anti-epileptics,191.54,4.02,195.56,neutral
we use antidepressants we use,193.459,5.61,199.06900000000002,neutral
anti-arrhythmic medications and the,195.56,7.2,202.76,neutral
general principle is to use small,199.069,5.911,204.98,neutral
amounts of the medication to slowly,202.76,6.02,208.78,neutral
escalate the dose and to balance,204.98,7.649,212.629,neutral
benefits in terms of pain relief with,208.78,6.789,215.569,neutral
any side effects that the patient may,212.629,8.28,220.909,neutral
experience always always optimizing,215.569,7.441,223.01,neutral
medication is the most important,220.909,5.64,226.54899999999998,neutral
treatment option we do have other,223.01,6.3,229.31,neutral
treatment options beyond that for,226.549,5.671,232.22,neutral
example we can do pulsed radio frequency,229.31,5.19,234.5,neutral
treatment which I will speak about in,232.22,5.759,237.97899999999998,neutral
another video we also have advanced pain,234.5,5.97,240.47,neutral
management treatments and we can offer,237.979,5.79,243.769,neutral
spinal cord stimulation and dorsal root,240.47,5.729,246.199,sad
ganglion stimulation now these are,243.769,4.731,248.5,neutral
advanced treatments and these are only,246.199,6.0,252.199,neutral
suggesting once all the usual treatment,248.5,7.599,256.099,neutral
options have been explored the other,252.199,5.76,257.959,NA
thing that we do with patients with,256.099,4.89,260.989,NA
peripheral neuropathy firstly we need to,257.959,5.311,263.27,NA
break the cycle of the pain improve the,260.989,4.291,265.28,NA
pain and get the symptoms under control,263.27,5.04,268.31,NA
as much as possible but we do need to,265.28,6.03,271.30999999999995,NA
rehabilitate the patient as well and,268.31,5.3,273.61,NA
that will be physical rehabilitation,271.31,4.409,275.719,NA
usually under the care of one of our,273.61,4.69,278.3,NA
pain physiotherapists and that Willing,275.719,3.371,279.09,NA
in Kali,278.3,2.92,281.22,NA
dude strengthening training aerobic,279.09,5.34,284.42999999999995,NA
training but also forward peripheral,281.22,6.14,287.36,NA
neuropathy we teach desensitization,284.43,5.519,289.949,NA
exercises now these are external,287.36,5.71,293.07,NA
physical treatments which the patient,289.949,6.03,295.979,NA
can do themselves on a daily basis and,293.07,5.46,298.53,NA
they're there to try and retrain the,295.979,5.131,301.11,NA
skin and to try and help reduce the,298.53,6.32,304.84999999999997,NA
overall pain levels,301.11,3.74,304.85,NA
