"I'd gotten into serious running with some co-workers from work and my wife and me were thinking about having a baby, and it was just something I wanted to do before that occurred and just thought that the Knoxville marathon was a good one because being a big UT fan and finishing at Neyland Stadium, I thought, what a way to finish your first marathon is to finish where you love watching the Vols play on Saturday.",5.14,23.76,28.900000000000002,angry
"Soreness was definitely one of the obstacles. About halfway through, when you're starting to run about a half marathon every Saturday morning, it gets kind of, it kind of wears on your body and about halfway through I was getting to a point where, I just didn't want to have to run that much anymore. You just got to work through it. Keep going. Cramps. I started cramping every mile starting at about mile 20 so after that I had to stop and stretch about every mile until I could finish.",32.98,25.64,58.62,sad
"You can definitely tell if what you're eating is affecting you on those longer runs.

"you're more in touch with your body and how you feel because of all the training. Just get a goal and set your mind to it. Realize that some days you're just not going to want to run. but if you get out there and run and just work through it, it'll all pay off. Even if your times aren't as good on that day, that's just one day. It's not about that one day. It's about a progression to race day. You need to get small goals, and once you meet one goal you just keep going.",97.22,24.56,121.78,sad
"I want to try to do the Memphis marathon. I was born and raised in Memphis. That's going to be my next goal, but I think one marathon a year is enough.",128.16,7.359999999999999,135.51999999999998,angry
