to that video in the description and this is going to be more of a tutorial on how to do it so first you just want to clean the site with alcohol and let that dry now I have,10.98,29.569,40.549,NA
to enter the sensor serial number into my app or receiver and it's just written on the very bottom of the adhesive backing and so I can either take a picture of it or enter it in then just,26.76,32.040000000000006,58.80000000000001,NA
to remove the adhesive backing there's two easy pull tabs there now I'm just gonna stick the adhesive to where I want to insert it and I'm gonna break off the safety latch just by folding it over,40.649,38.671,79.32,NA
like that so now it's all stuck down and I'm ready to insert it and the way you insert it is just an easy one button push one two three there we go boom it's in I love how easy it is to,62.34,30.287999999999997,92.628,NA
pull off the inserter once it's in now I'm gonna take my transmitter out and I'm just gonna clean the back with alcohol next I'm gonna insert the tab of the transmitter into the sensor and snap,80.13,30.840000000000003,110.97,NA

just gonna start the center on my phone and I'm ready to use g6 so that was definitely a way easier insertion than the g5 sensor if you've used the g5 you know that it's kind of complicated a,110.89,22.23,133.12,NA
little bit cumbersome so the one button push is definitely an upgrade I also just really love how the transmitter feels now like I was saying it's super thin and just smooth and more flush with,121.81,21.869999999999997,143.68,happy
the skin than it used to be and even the kind of casing around it that holds the transmitter in is just way more smooth and less pokey so I'm super excited to start using the Dexcom g6 now Thank You,132.64,27.18,159.82,happy
