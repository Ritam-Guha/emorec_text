hey everyone it's daebak Danica and,0.03,3.21,3.2399999999999998,surprise
today I'm going to show you how to,1.92,4.379,6.2989999999999995,surprise
insert a Dexcom g6 sensor if you missed,3.24,5.67,8.91,surprise
my video of me inserting a Dexcom g6 for,6.299,4.681,10.98,fear
the very first time I will have the link,8.91,3.66,12.57,fear
to that video in the description and,10.98,2.67,13.65,fear
this is going to be more of a tutorial,12.57,4.04,16.61,fear
on how to do it,13.65,2.96,16.61,fear
so first you just want to clean the site,16.82,9.94,26.759999999999998,fear
with alcohol and let that dry now I have,19.23,9.959,29.189,fear
to enter the sensor serial number into,26.76,5.999,32.759,fear
my app or receiver and it's just written,29.189,5.671,34.86,sad
on the very bottom of the adhesive,32.759,5.101,37.86,happy
backing and so I can either take a,34.86,5.789,40.649,fear
picture of it or enter it in then just,37.86,9.48,47.34,fear
to remove the adhesive backing there's,40.649,8.971,49.620000000000005,sad
two easy pull tabs there now I'm just,47.34,3.96,51.300000000000004,NA
gonna stick the adhesive to where I want,49.62,8.16,57.78,NA
to insert it and I'm gonna break off the,51.3,11.04,62.339999999999996,NA
safety latch just by folding it over,57.78,6.54,64.32000000000001,NA
like that so now it's all stuck down and,62.34,5.16,67.5,NA
I'm ready to insert it and the way you,64.32,4.77,69.08999999999999,NA
insert it is just an easy one button,67.5,8.299,75.799,NA
push one two three there we go,69.09,6.709,75.799,NA
boom it's in I love how easy it is to,76.82,5.35,82.16999999999999,NA
pull off the inserter once it's in now,80.13,6.629,86.759,NA
I'm gonna take my transmitter out and,82.17,5.61,87.78,NA
I'm just gonna clean the back with,86.759,5.341,92.1,NA
alcohol next I'm gonna insert the tab of,87.78,6.39,94.17,NA
the transmitter into the sensor and snap,92.1,6.87,98.97,NA
it into place then just circle around,94.17,8.79,102.96000000000001,NA
the adhesive three times and you're good,98.97,6.04,105.01,NA
to go,102.96,4.57,107.53,NA
oh my goodness I love it it's definitely,105.01,5.88,110.89,NA
so much smaller under my shirt and I'm,107.53,4.92,112.45,NA
just gonna start the center on my phone,110.89,3.81,114.7,NA
and I'm ready to use g6 so that was,112.45,4.74,117.19,sad
definitely a way easier insertion than,114.7,5.7,120.4,fear
the g5 sensor if you've used the g5 you,117.19,4.62,121.81,fear
know that it's kind of complicated a,120.4,3.36,123.76,fear
little bit cumbersome so the one button,121.81,4.2,126.01,fear
push is definitely an upgrade I also,123.76,3.57,127.33,fear
just really love how the transmitter,126.01,3.27,129.28,fear
feels now like I was saying it's super,127.33,5.31,132.64,fear
thin and just smooth and more flush with,129.28,5.52,134.8,sad
the skin than it used to be and even the,132.64,4.38,137.01999999999998,fear
kind of casing around it that holds the,134.8,4.59,139.39000000000001,fear
transmitter in is just way more smooth,137.02,6.3,143.32000000000002,fear
and less pokey so I'm super excited to,139.39,6.87,146.26,fear
start using the Dexcom g6 now Thank You,143.32,5.04,148.35999999999999,fear
Dexcom for sending me some of the early,146.26,4.98,151.23999999999998,fear

it if you use the Dexcom or been,155.89,3.45,159.33999999999997,fear
thinking about it I definitely love,157.63,3.15,160.78,fear
using the Dexcom I think it gives you a,159.34,3.15,162.49,surprise
lot of great information about what your,160.78,3.87,164.65,fear
blood sugar is doing including alarming,162.49,3.57,166.06,fear
for to high or low and then really,164.65,3.42,168.07,fear
excited about the new system with all,166.06,4.26,170.32,sad
the upgrades like 10 day where no,168.07,4.98,173.04999999999998,happy
calibrations and not being affected by,170.32,4.68,175.0,sad
