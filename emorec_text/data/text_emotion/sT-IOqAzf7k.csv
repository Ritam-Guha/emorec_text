that's not using the Rotterdam criteria, but",159.03,3.56,162.59,fear

insulin to absorb glucose so that they can",307.33,4.38,311.71,fear

"And so one of the theories of PCOS is that
the ovaries are resisting insulin and the",312.77,6.75,319.52,neutral

growing in the absence of proper fuel, or",319.52,7.239,326.75899999999996,fear

these follicles, or cysts.",326.759,5.96,332.719,fear
"And so, absence of periods, or irregular periods;
male-pattern hair growth; obesity; infertility",332.719,6.51,339.229,fear
"and then the presence of those cysts on the
ovaries are all symptoms of PCOS.",339.229,4.21,343.43899999999996,fear

we'll send patients in for a transvaginal",343.439,3.931,347.37,fear

conventional therapies of PCOS.",434.71,4.829,439.539,fear

deal with each symptom individually.",444.919,5.041,449.96,fear
