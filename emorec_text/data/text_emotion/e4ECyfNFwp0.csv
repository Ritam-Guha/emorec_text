and i am turkish we love beans too,38.32,5.68,44.0,surprise

of it and anything with a lot of it will,49.2,4.4,53.6,fear

why beans are actually not a bad food,53.6,6.24,59.84,fear
for diabetes and what are all the health,56.8,5.68,62.48,fear
uh benefits let's talk about that so,59.84,6.0,65.84,surprise
the beans are good because it is a great,62.48,6.56,69.03999999999999,fear
source of protein and there's no fat in,65.84,4.88,70.72,fear
it pretty much so there's i mean there's,69.04,3.84,72.88000000000001,fear
no saturated fat at least in it,70.72,3.12,73.84,fear
so,72.88,2.4,75.28,fear
when you're eating red meat you're,73.84,3.52,77.36,fear
having a lot of saturated fat that comes,75.28,3.839,79.119,fear
with it there are some carcinogenic,77.36,3.36,80.72,neutral
factors that comes with red meat,79.119,4.401,83.52,fear
especially the processed red meat versus,80.72,5.12,85.84,fear
with the beans you're getting a lot of,83.52,4.88,88.39999999999999,fear
protein you're getting a lot of fiber as,85.84,6.08,91.92,fear
well remember fiber is very important to,88.4,6.16,94.56,fear
slow the digestion and prevent the blood,91.92,4.879,96.799,fear
sugar spike or at least slow the,94.56,5.12,99.68,neutral
absorption of carbohydrates and prevents,96.799,5.28,102.07900000000001,fear
a rapid spike in your blood sugar now of,99.68,4.079,103.759,fear
course let's talk about the nutrition,102.079,6.161,108.24,fear
effects a little bit 1 3 cup of beans is,103.759,7.841,111.6,fear
typically around 15 grams of carbs so,108.24,4.96,113.19999999999999,fear
what i want you to do,111.6,5.36,116.96,fear
go and get a one cup in us measure i,113.2,5.919,119.119,fear
don't know how you guys measure in other,116.96,4.08,121.03999999999999,neutral
countries that you're watching but i can,119.119,3.441,122.56,fear
only give you an example of u.s,121.04,5.359,126.399,fear
measurement one cup see how much of one,122.56,5.199,127.759,fear
cup is,126.399,3.121,129.52,fear
what is one third of it because if,127.759,4.641,132.4,fear
you're having a whole cup a full cup of,129.52,6.079,135.59900000000002,fear
beans you're getting 45 grams of carbs,132.4,5.52,137.92000000000002,fear
that pretty much puts you at maximum,135.599,4.72,140.319,fear
limit of carbohydrates for your meal,137.92,5.44,143.35999999999999,fear
if you're having beans and no rice,140.319,5.041,145.35999999999999,fear
that's acceptable that's that's fair,143.36,3.76,147.12,fear
enough but if you're putting your beans,145.36,3.599,148.959,fear
on top of rice that's going to spike,147.12,4.24,151.36,fear
your blood sugar if you're having bread,148.959,4.081,153.04,fear
with your beans that's going to spike,151.36,3.28,154.64000000000001,happy
your blood sugar so you have to be,153.04,3.199,156.239,fear
careful about what you're having your,154.64,4.239,158.879,fear
beans with now in the mediterranean,156.239,4.961,161.20000000000002,fear
countries they actually cook beans and,158.879,4.72,163.599,fear
they basically season it with olive oil,161.2,5.2,166.39999999999998,fear
and with some spices it goes great,163.599,5.28,168.879,fear
actually next to red meat as well so,166.4,4.88,171.28,fear
instead of having your potato having,168.879,4.72,173.599,fear
some beans next to your meat may be a,171.28,4.16,175.44,fear
great alternative as well now the,173.599,4.481,178.07999999999998,fear
glycemic index is not that high it's,175.44,6.0,181.44,fear
good but again glycemic load can be,178.08,5.28,183.36,fear
high if you're eating,181.44,4.159,185.599,fear
like more than one cup of it so what are,183.36,5.76,189.12,fear
the vitamins and minerals that are in,185.599,7.041,192.64,fear
the beans there's a lot of folate,189.12,4.56,193.68,fear
iron,192.64,2.08,194.72,
copper,193.68,5.839,199.519,
manganese potassium and vitamin k,194.72,7.04,201.76,
so again you're getting a lot of,199.519,5.44,204.959,fear
vitamins and minerals a lot of fiber,201.76,5.68,207.44,fear
good amount of protein when you have,204.959,5.681,210.64000000000001,fear
beans at a reasonable amount there are a,207.44,6.0,213.44,fear
lot of studies also showing that eating,210.64,5.04,215.67999999999998,fear
beans can reduce the risk of colon,213.44,5.2,218.64,fear
cancer now as you know diabetics have,215.68,5.36,221.04000000000002,fear
high risk of cancer of pretty much any,218.64,5.92,224.55999999999997,fear
cancer so definitely having high fiber,221.04,5.919,226.959,fear
foods in your diet such as beans will,224.56,5.039,229.599,fear
help reduce the risk of colon cancer as,226.959,4.321,231.28,fear
well so what is the downside of the,229.599,4.801,234.39999999999998,fear
beans well if you're not used to it you,231.28,6.08,237.36,fear
will have a lot of flatulence and gas,234.4,5.44,239.84,happy
and that may be annoying especially in,237.36,5.2,242.56,fear
the beginning so if you're not a bean,239.84,5.36,245.20000000000002,fear
eater and you just get pumped up and you,242.56,4.959,247.519,fear
want to go get some beans today oh well,245.2,3.92,249.11999999999998,fear
you may want to,247.519,5.28,252.799,fear
start slowly because those beans can,249.12,6.319,255.439,fear
create even abdominal cramps if you're,252.799,5.84,258.639,fear
not used to it so start with as i said,255.439,6.241,261.68,fear
one third cup of beans and if you want,258.639,5.201,263.84000000000003,fear
more later if you're not affected as,261.68,4.72,266.40000000000003,fear
much you can definitely have more,263.84,4.88,268.71999999999997,fear
up to one cup of beans next to your,266.4,4.239,270.63899999999995,fear
maybe healthy meat,268.72,4.32,273.04,fear
