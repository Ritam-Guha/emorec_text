hey welcome to nourishment i'm dr lara,8.96,4.16,13.120000000000001,sad
you may be familiar with the glycemic,11.28,4.479,15.759,neutral
index or gi because it's frequently,13.12,5.2,18.32,neutral
recommended to eat low gi foods for,15.759,5.121,20.880000000000003,neutral
health the glycemic index is a method,18.32,4.64,22.96,neutral
used to categorize foods based on how,20.88,4.319,25.198999999999998,neutral
they impact your blood glucose the way,22.96,4.319,27.279,neutral
this works is the blood glucose response,25.199,4.16,29.359,sad
to a test food say this whole wheat,27.279,4.96,32.239,sad
bread is measured over two hours and,29.359,4.321,33.68,sad
it's compared to the blood glucose,32.239,3.521,35.76,NA
response for a reference food like a,33.68,4.64,38.32,NA
sugar drink based on these comparisons,35.76,5.2,40.96,neutral
foods can be categorized as low gi,38.32,4.16,42.480000000000004,neutral
meaning that they don't raise your blood,40.96,2.8,43.76,neutral
glucose much,42.48,4.32,46.8,sad
medium gi or high gi meaning that they,43.76,5.2,48.96,neutral
raise your blood glucose a lot so it,46.8,3.919,50.718999999999994,neutral
follows that if you want to avoid high,48.96,3.599,52.559,neutral

avoid high gi foods right,52.559,4.401,56.959999999999994,NA
well it's a bit more complicated than,55.12,4.0,59.12,NA

for determining the glycemic index,59.12,4.56,63.68,happy
requires eating 50 grams of digestible,61.12,4.96,66.08,sad

sucrose in the sugar drink or 50 grams,66.08,5.2,71.28,neutral
of carbs minus the fiber in the whole,68.88,4.72,73.6,neutral

which categorizes it as a high gi food,106.24,5.28,111.52,sad
