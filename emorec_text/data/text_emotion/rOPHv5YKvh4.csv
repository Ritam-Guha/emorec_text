what is the glycemic load and why does it matter more than the glycemic index let's science it [Music] hey welcome to nourishment i'm dr lara,0.24,21.68,21.919999999999998,sad
you may be familiar with the glycemic index or gi because it's frequently recommended to eat low gi foods for health the glycemic index is a method used to categorize foods based on how,11.28,23.759,35.039,sad
they impact your blood glucose the way this works is the blood glucose response to a test food say this whole wheat bread is measured over two hours and it's compared to the blood glucose,22.96,21.281,44.241,sad
response for a reference food like a sugar drink based on these comparisons foods can be categorized as low gi meaning that they don't raise your blood glucose much,33.68,21.12,54.8,sad
medium gi or high gi meaning that they raise your blood glucose a lot so it follows that if you want to avoid high spikes in blood glucose that you should avoid high gi foods right,43.76,21.52,65.28,sad
well it's a bit more complicated than that because here's the thing the method for determining the glycemic index requires eating 50 grams of digestible carbohydrate so that's 50 grams of,55.12,22.88,78.0,sad
sucrose in the sugar drink or 50 grams of carbs minus the fiber in the whole wheat bread and depending on the test food sometimes 50 grams of carbs is a way bigger serving size than you'd ever,66.08,23.119,89.199,sad
reasonably eat in a sitting when i did my gi experiment with dave's killer seed bread not an ad just a fan i had to eat three full slices to get 50 grams of digestible carbs that's more than i'd,77.92,24.561,102.481,sad
usually eat this conundrum is even more striking with watermelon i'd need to eat four and a half cups of watermelon to get 50 grams of digestible carbs that's nearly an entire watermelon,90.24,21.839,112.079,sad
previous studies have calculated the glycemic index of watermelon to be 76 which categorizes it as a high gi food but if we want a tool to help predict glycemic responses in the real world we,101.439,24.88,126.31899999999999,sad
need to take typical serving sizes into consideration and that's where glycemic load comes in the glycemic load or gl is a ranking system that corrects the glycemic index,113.6,22.64,136.24,NA
for the number of carbohydrates in a typical serving size to calculate the gl you simply multiply the number of digestible carbs in a serving by the gi and divide by 100 we,125.119,24.641,149.76,NA
know that watermelon has a high gi of 76 but it's mostly water a typical 100 gram serving of watermelon has 7 grams of digestible carbs to calculate the gl we take that 7 gram,136.72,25.919999999999998,162.64,sad
serving of carbs multiplied by the gi of 76 and divide by 100 to give us a gl of five foods are categorized into low medium or high gl where a lower gl means a serving,150.0,27.598999999999997,177.599,sad
of food raises your blood glucose less this categorizes watermelon as a low glycemic load food so a typical serving size won't cause a huge spike in blood glucose overall the glycemic load is a,163.599,25.679,189.278,fear
better reflection of expected blood glucose responses to foods based on how much we usually eat in a serving that makes it more useful than the glycemic index there are still some more,176.959,20.402,197.361,NA
complications with the applicability of the glycemic load in the real world and i dig into them in my glycemic responses video series linked here that's what science tastes like thanks for tuning in,187.04,21.438,208.47799999999998,NA
