in the late 70s dr david jenkins of the,0.719,5.361,6.08,NA
university of toronto realized that,4.08,4.24,8.32,NA
knowing the total amount of carbs in,6.08,4.16,10.24,NA
foods was not enough to predict the,8.32,4.16,12.48,NA
effects of these sugars on blood glucose,10.24,3.519,13.759,NA
fluctuations,12.48,3.359,15.839,NA
knowing the type of carbs containing a,13.759,4.161,17.92,NA
food simple sugars or complex,15.839,3.2,19.039,NA
carbohydrates,17.92,3.279,21.199,NA
provided some clues but was far from,19.039,4.881,23.92,NA
sufficient to make a correct prediction,21.199,4.32,25.519000000000002,NA
there are some foods that are rich in,23.92,3.76,27.68,fear
complex starches such as white bread,25.519,4.08,29.598999999999997,fear
that raise blood glucose quickly and,27.68,4.16,31.84,neutral
abruptly whereas some fruits rich in,29.599,3.281,32.88,neutral
simple sugars,31.84,3.44,35.28,neutral
such as blueberries barely raise blood,32.88,3.76,36.64,neutral
glucose at all,35.28,4.799,40.079,neutral
in 1981 jenkins and co-workers published,36.64,4.239,40.879,neutral
a landmark,40.079,2.48,42.559,neutral
article in the american journal of,40.879,3.601,44.48,neutral
clinical nutrition in which they,42.559,3.68,46.239,neutral
proposed a new indicator,44.48,4.239,48.718999999999994,neutral
that was able to measure the speed at,46.239,5.281,51.519999999999996,neutral
which sugars containing a specific food,48.719,5.121,53.84,neutral
would raise blood glucose and they call,51.52,3.359,54.879000000000005,neutral
this indicator,53.84,4.16,58.0,neutral
glycemic index propelled by numerous,54.879,5.281,60.16,neutral
findings about the detrimental effects,58.0,4.239,62.239,neutral
of repeated and elevated blood glucose,60.16,3.199,63.358999999999995,neutral
and insulin peaks,62.239,3.2,65.439,neutral
and their risk for fat accumulation,63.359,4.321,67.68,neutral
obesity diabetes and cardiovascular,65.439,2.961,68.39999999999999,neutral
disease,67.68,3.2,70.88000000000001,neutral
the concept of glycemic index soon,68.4,4.24,72.64,neutral
became very popular,70.88,4.239,75.119,neutral
the higher the glycemic index of a food,72.64,4.08,76.72,neutral
the faster its carbs,75.119,3.601,78.72,neutral
enter the bloodstream and raise blood,76.72,4.0,80.72,neutral
glucose causing the pancreas,78.72,4.719,83.439,neutral
to release insulin you may wonder how,80.72,4.56,85.28,neutral
this index is calculated,83.439,4.081,87.52,neutral
in a few words here's how you take a,85.28,4.799,90.07900000000001,neutral
solution of 50 grams of glucose in water,87.52,3.84,91.36,neutral
and you give it to a group of,90.079,2.321,92.39999999999999,neutral
individuals,91.36,3.36,94.72,neutral
then for the next two hours you draw a,92.4,4.32,96.72,neutral
drop of blood by finger puncture at,94.72,2.56,97.28,neutral
regular,96.72,2.719,99.439,neutral
intervals and you measure blood glucose,97.28,3.519,100.799,neutral
concentrations,99.439,2.96,102.39899999999999,neutral
in this example you see that blood,100.799,4.0,104.799,neutral
glucose peaks between 30 minutes and 1,102.399,3.04,105.43900000000001,neutral
hour,104.799,2.881,107.68,neutral
and after 2 hours is almost back to,105.439,3.441,108.88,neutral
baseline,107.68,3.84,111.52000000000001,neutral
if you measure the area below this curve,108.88,4.559,113.439,neutral
you know it's proportional to the amount,111.52,2.559,114.079,neutral
of glucose,113.439,2.64,116.079,neutral
that was in the bloodstream during these,114.079,3.201,117.27999999999999,neutral
two hours,116.079,3.441,119.52,neutral
then you take the same subjects and you,117.28,3.119,120.399,neutral
have them eat,119.52,3.68,123.2,neutral
a test food say a bowl of lentils in,120.399,4.641,125.04,neutral
such an amount that the quantity of,123.2,2.879,126.07900000000001,neutral
carbs they contain,125.04,3.439,128.479,neutral
is still 50 grams let me stress this,126.079,4.481,130.56,neutral
again you're not giving them 50 grams of,128.479,2.721,131.20000000000002,neutral
lentils,130.56,3.039,133.599,neutral
but a serving of lentils that provides,131.2,4.16,135.35999999999999,neutral
50 grams of carbs,133.599,3.601,137.2,neutral
now you do the same measurement and in,135.36,3.599,138.959,neutral
this example you see that the peak is,137.2,3.52,140.72,neutral
about at the same time but it's much,138.959,2.401,141.36,neutral
lower,140.72,3.12,143.84,neutral
and it doesn't decline as fast of course,141.36,4.0,145.36,neutral
different people will respond in,143.84,2.479,146.31900000000002,neutral
different ways,145.36,2.72,148.08,neutral
but this doesn't matter because you can,146.319,4.0,150.319,neutral
use the first measurement to standardize,148.08,3.36,151.44000000000003,neutral
the result,150.319,3.041,153.35999999999999,neutral
so you calculate the area under the,151.44,3.439,154.879,neutral
curve for your lentils,153.36,3.68,157.04000000000002,neutral
and divide it by the area you obtain for,154.879,3.601,158.48,neutral
the solution of glucose,157.04,4.0,161.04,neutral
times 100 to get rid of the decimals and,158.48,4.479,162.959,neutral
there you have your glycemic index of,161.04,2.88,163.92,neutral
lentils,162.959,3.28,166.239,neutral
if you have worked well you will get,163.92,4.24,168.16,neutral
very similar numbers in all your,166.239,3.521,169.76,neutral
different subjects,168.16,3.76,171.92,neutral
to complicate things some labs have,169.76,4.559,174.319,neutral
chosen not to use glucose in water as a,171.92,3.12,175.04,neutral
standard,174.319,3.681,178.0,neutral
but white bread this has advantages and,175.04,5.04,180.07999999999998,neutral
disadvantages whose discussion goes,178.0,4.08,182.08,neutral
beyond the scope of our course,180.08,3.519,183.59900000000002,neutral
just keep in mind that you cannot,182.08,4.239,186.31900000000002,neutral
compare gi numbers from different tables,183.599,4.64,188.23899999999998,neutral
if they are calculated using different,186.319,3.041,189.35999999999999,neutral
standards,188.239,3.681,191.92000000000002,neutral
the numbers i will show you here are all,189.36,4.48,193.84,neutral
calculated using glucose,191.92,5.36,197.28,neutral
as a standard the concept of glycemic,193.84,4.16,198.0,neutral
index is,197.28,3.599,200.879,neutral
often misunderstood so let me clarify a,198.0,3.28,201.28,neutral
very,200.879,3.601,204.48,neutral
important point the glycemic index is a,201.28,5.039,206.319,neutral
measure of the speed,204.48,4.479,208.959,neutral
at which the carbs in a food raise blood,206.319,3.681,210.0,neutral
glucose levels,208.959,3.601,212.56,neutral
it is not a measure of the extent of,210.0,3.519,213.519,neutral
this effect,212.56,2.72,215.28,neutral
because the glycemic index is,213.519,4.241,217.76,neutral
independent of the amounts of carb,215.28,5.36,220.64000000000001,neutral
contained in a food think of a man,217.76,4.479,222.239,neutral
target shooting with a gun,220.64,4.0,224.64,neutral
the glycemic index would tell us how,222.239,4.161,226.4,neutral
fast he shoots his bullets,224.64,3.679,228.319,neutral
but he does not tell us how many bullets,226.4,3.119,229.519,neutral
he has to shoot,228.319,3.601,231.92,neutral
if he only has a few bullets he can,229.519,4.321,233.84,neutral
shoot them as fast as he wants,231.92,4.319,236.23899999999998,neutral
but he'll still not be very deadly so,233.84,4.88,238.72,neutral
the glycemic index only makes sense,236.239,4.801,241.04,neutral
if we consider it together with another,238.72,3.68,242.4,neutral
piece of information,241.04,3.919,244.959,neutral
which is the amount of carbs contained,242.4,3.52,245.92000000000002,neutral
in that food,244.959,3.2,248.159,neutral
for example carrots have a relatively,245.92,3.84,249.76,neutral
high glycemic index,248.159,3.841,252.0,neutral
but they also have very little sugar,249.76,3.92,253.67999999999998,neutral
this means their sugar enters the,252.0,2.4,254.4,neutral
bloodstream,253.68,3.119,256.79900000000004,neutral
fast but because it's very small amount,254.4,4.64,259.04,neutral
the overall effect of carrots on blood,256.799,3.84,260.63899999999995,neutral
glucose and insulin release,259.04,4.4,263.44,neutral
is minimal conversely the glycemic index,260.639,4.801,265.44,neutral
of potatoes is lower than that of,263.44,2.64,266.08,neutral
carrots,265.44,2.479,267.919,neutral
but while an average carrot has about,266.08,3.28,269.35999999999996,neutral
four grams of carbs,267.919,4.481,272.4,neutral
an average potato has about 25 grams,269.36,5.44,274.8,neutral
so even if these carbs are absorbed more,272.4,4.4,276.79999999999995,neutral
slowly they still have a significant,274.8,3.6,278.40000000000003,neutral
effect on blood glucose,276.8,4.24,281.04,neutral
and insulin because they are a lot to,278.4,3.6,282.0,neutral
take into account,281.04,3.2,284.24,neutral
was the glycemic index and the total,282.0,3.6,285.6,neutral
amount of carbs,284.24,3.6,287.84000000000003,neutral
a group of researchers from harvard,285.6,5.44,291.04,neutral
university proposed in 1997 the concept,287.84,4.4,292.23999999999995,neutral
of glycemic,291.04,3.76,294.8,neutral
load it is very simple it's just a,292.24,4.48,296.72,neutral
glycemic index of a food,294.8,4.32,299.12,neutral
times the amount of digestible carbs,296.72,4.64,301.36,neutral
contained in a standard serving of that,299.12,2.799,301.919,neutral
food,301.36,3.119,304.47900000000004,neutral
divided by 100 just to get rid of some,301.919,3.601,305.52,neutral
zeros,304.479,2.801,307.28,neutral
this way you have an index that,305.52,3.679,309.19899999999996,neutral
considers both factors,307.28,4.72,312.0,neutral
if a food has a low gi but a lot of,309.199,3.521,312.72,neutral
sugars,312.0,2.96,314.96,neutral
its glycemic load will still be high,312.72,3.12,315.84000000000003,neutral
conversely,314.96,3.519,318.479,neutral
if it has a high glycemic index but very,315.84,3.68,319.52,neutral
few sugars,318.479,2.961,321.44,neutral
its glycemic load will still be,319.52,3.44,322.96,neutral
relatively low,321.44,3.759,325.199,neutral
let's go back to our previous example,322.96,4.56,327.52,neutral
and let's consider a glycemic index of,325.199,5.361,330.56,neutral
72 for carrots and of 63 for boiled,327.52,4.0,331.52,neutral
potatoes,330.56,3.359,333.919,neutral
the glycemic load over carrot would be,331.52,4.88,336.4,neutral
72 times 4 grams of carbs,333.919,5.84,339.75899999999996,neutral
divided by 103 the glycemic load of our,336.4,5.28,341.67999999999995,neutral
potato would be 63,339.759,6.081,345.84000000000003,neutral
times 25 grams of carbs divided by 116.,341.68,6.239,347.919,neutral
so the glycemic load of our potato is,345.84,4.24,350.08,neutral
more than five fold the glycemic load of,347.919,2.961,350.88,neutral
our carrot,350.08,3.839,353.919,neutral
even though its glycemic index is slower,350.88,5.92,356.8,neutral
watermelon also has a high glycemic,353.919,4.4,358.31899999999996,neutral
index of 72,356.8,4.88,361.68,neutral
but a slice of 120 grams only has,358.319,6.32,364.639,neutral
6 grams of sugar so its glycemic load is,361.68,3.6,365.28000000000003,neutral
4.,364.639,3.12,367.759,neutral
a banana of the same weight has a much,365.28,4.72,370.0,neutral
lower glycemic index 52,367.759,4.56,372.319,neutral
but it has 20 grams of carbs so its,370.0,4.0,374.0,neutral
glycemic load is 11,372.319,4.72,377.03900000000004,neutral
almost three times that of watermelon of,374.0,5.039,379.039,neutral
course the glycemic load has one big,377.039,2.961,380.0,neutral
disadvantage,379.039,3.041,382.08,neutral
compared to the glycemic index the,380.0,4.72,384.72,neutral
glycemic index is always the same,382.08,4.959,387.039,neutral
independent of the amount of food the,384.72,4.16,388.88000000000005,neutral
glycemic load is always,387.039,4.88,391.919,neutral
based on a specific amount of food if i,388.88,3.439,392.319,neutral
eat,391.919,3.28,395.19899999999996,neutral
three slices of watermelon the glycemic,392.319,5.041,397.36,neutral
load would be three times higher,395.199,4.321,399.52000000000004,neutral
while the glycemic index would still be,397.36,3.36,400.72,neutral
72.,399.52,4.56,404.08,neutral
take this coke its glycemic index is 58.,400.72,6.8,407.52000000000004,neutral
a small 100 milliliters glass a,404.08,6.559,410.639,neutral

cup,410.639,3.521,414.16,neutral
all have a glycemic index of 58 but the,411.199,5.12,416.319,neutral
small glass has 11 grams of sugar,414.16,5.36,419.52000000000004,neutral
with a glycemic load of 6.4 the can is,416.319,5.041,421.36,neutral
37 grams of sugar,419.52,5.04,424.56,neutral
glycemic load 21.5 and the large cup,421.36,6.839,428.199,neutral
67 grams of sugar and a glycemic load of,424.56,4.88,429.44,neutral
38.9,428.199,4.601,432.8,neutral
and by the way 266 calories,429.44,5.759,435.199,neutral
the composition of a food is of course,432.8,3.76,436.56,neutral
the first determinant,435.199,4.321,439.52000000000004,neutral
of its glycemic index in particular two,436.56,3.84,440.4,neutral
key factors,439.52,3.36,442.88,neutral
are the type of carbs and the presence,440.4,3.919,444.31899999999996,neutral
of other nutrients,442.88,3.92,446.8,neutral
as far as simple sugars are concerned,444.319,4.88,449.199,neutral
glucose raises the glycemic index,446.8,5.28,452.08,neutral
much more than fructose sucrose is in,449.199,5.041,454.24,neutral
between since it mixes the two,452.08,4.88,456.96,neutral
as for complex carbs the more branched,454.24,3.679,457.919,neutral
starch is,456.96,3.359,460.31899999999996,neutral
the lower the glycemic index because it,457.919,4.641,462.56,neutral
will take longer to break it down,460.319,4.641,464.96000000000004,neutral
as for other nutrients the presence of,462.56,5.039,467.599,neutral
fiber proteins and lipids slows down,464.96,4.32,469.28,neutral
gastric emptying and intestinal,467.599,2.961,470.56,neutral
absorption of glucose,469.28,3.44,472.71999999999997,neutral
thus lowering the glycemic index of a,470.56,4.8,475.36,neutral
food it is easy to understand why whole,472.72,4.64,477.36,neutral
grains and their derivative products,475.36,4.48,479.84000000000003,neutral
have lower glycemic indexes than their,477.36,4.48,481.84000000000003,neutral
refined counterparts,479.84,4.16,484.0,neutral
but many other factors affect the,481.84,4.079,485.919,neutral
glycemic index of a food,484.0,4.479,488.479,neutral
including preparation processing and,485.919,3.441,489.35999999999996,neutral
cooking,488.479,3.601,492.08,neutral
let's consider our potato again if we,489.36,3.6,492.96000000000004,neutral
snack on it,492.08,3.6,495.68,neutral
raw its glycemic index will be close to,492.96,5.12,498.08,neutral
zero because the starch of a raw potato,495.68,3.04,498.72,neutral
is almost,498.08,3.36,501.44,neutral
entirely undigestible so it will travel,498.72,4.8,503.52000000000004,neutral
intact through our small intestine,501.44,4.72,506.16,neutral
without absorption if we boil that,503.52,3.359,506.87899999999996,neutral
potato,506.16,3.439,509.59900000000005,neutral
its glycemic index will quickly raise to,506.879,5.6,512.479,neutral
about 60 because starch gelatinizes with,509.599,3.36,512.959,neutral
heat,512.479,3.12,515.599,neutral
and becomes easily digestible if however,512.959,3.121,516.0799999999999,neutral
we eat,515.599,3.68,519.279,neutral
that same potato with its skin its fiber,516.08,5.36,521.44,neutral
will slow down glucose digestion and,519.279,3.361,522.64,neutral
absorption,521.44,4.24,525.6800000000001,neutral
and as a result its gi will be lower,522.64,5.52,528.16,neutral
conversely if we turn that potato into a,525.68,3.76,529.4399999999999,neutral
mashed potato,528.16,4.16,532.3199999999999,neutral
its gi will further raise because starch,529.44,3.36,532.8000000000001,neutral
becomes,532.32,2.8,535.12,neutral
even more accessible to our digestive,532.8,4.64,537.4399999999999,neutral
enzymes which will convert it to glucose,535.12,3.68,538.8,neutral
even faster,537.44,3.6,541.0400000000001,neutral
finally if we don't eat our potato at,538.8,4.56,543.3599999999999,neutral
all and just leave it there at room temp,541.04,4.64,545.68,neutral
within a few hours its starch will start,543.36,4.4,547.76,neutral
retrogradation becoming less and less,545.68,3.04,548.7199999999999,neutral
digestible,547.76,4.0,551.76,neutral
and its gi will progressively decrease,548.72,4.96,553.6800000000001,neutral
together with the desirability of our,551.76,4.16,555.92,neutral
potato which will become less and less,553.68,5.12,558.8,neutral
soft and buttery the degree of cooking,555.92,4.16,560.0799999999999,neutral
always matters,558.8,3.84,562.64,neutral
if raw pasta has a glycemic index close,560.08,3.439,563.519,neutral
to zero,562.64,3.44,566.08,neutral
al dente pasta the way we italians like,563.519,4.241,567.76,neutral
it still somewhat firm,566.08,4.24,570.32,neutral
has a gi of about 50 because part of its,567.76,5.44,573.2,neutral
starch is still harder to digest,570.32,5.199,575.519,neutral
conversely overcooked pasta to the point,573.2,3.68,576.88,neutral
it becomes soft,575.519,3.921,579.44,neutral
that you somehow appear to like has a gi,576.88,4.48,581.36,neutral
about 10 points higher because its,579.44,2.64,582.08,neutral
starch,581.36,3.599,584.9590000000001,neutral
turns to glucose much faster some,582.08,4.64,586.72,neutral
technological processes,584.959,4.88,589.8389999999999,neutral
also fragment starch raising gi,586.72,5.52,592.24,neutral
such as extrusion to make potato chips,589.839,3.601,593.44,neutral
or corn flakes,592.24,4.64,596.88,neutral
or pressure steaming to make puffed rice,593.44,6.16,599.6,neutral
as far as fruit is concerned the degree,596.88,3.68,600.56,neutral
of ripeness,599.6,4.08,603.6800000000001,neutral
influences the gi as the fruit ripens,600.56,5.68,606.2399999999999,neutral
its acids are converted to sugars the,603.68,4.32,608.0,neutral
texture becomes softer,606.24,4.8,611.04,neutral
and the gi tends to increase an overripe,608.0,5.68,613.68,neutral
banana will have a higher glycemic index,611.04,5.12,616.16,neutral
that one that's still green and then of,613.68,4.399,618.079,neutral
course peeling fruits and veggies,616.16,4.239,620.399,neutral
always raises the gi because you remove,618.079,3.521,621.5999999999999,neutral
a lot of fiber,620.399,3.921,624.32,neutral
whenever we cut blend puree or in any,621.6,5.2,626.8000000000001,neutral
way turn the food into smaller pieces,624.32,5.28,629.6,neutral
the work of digestive enzymes is easier,626.8,4.96,631.76,neutral
and glucose absorption is faster,629.6,5.04,634.64,neutral
so the gi increases if you turn your,631.76,5.519,637.279,neutral
bottle of lentils into a lentil puree,634.64,5.439,640.079,neutral
its gi will be higher if you juice a,637.279,3.441,640.72,neutral
carrot,640.079,2.721,642.8,neutral
carrot juice will have a much higher gi,640.72,3.28,644.0,neutral
than the whole carrot,642.8,3.92,646.7199999999999,neutral
and so on so far we have talked about,644.0,4.959,648.959,neutral
individual foods but it is important to,646.72,4.16,650.88,neutral
remember that most of the time we,648.959,4.481,653.4399999999999,neutral
combine different foods in a meal,650.88,5.36,656.24,neutral
when we do that these foods mix in our,653.44,3.36,656.8000000000001,neutral
stomach,656.24,3.36,659.6,neutral
and get digested and absorbed together,656.8,3.279,660.079,neutral
so what,659.6,2.479,662.0790000000001,neutral
really matters in the end is not the,660.079,4.401,664.4799999999999,neutral
glycemic index or the glycemic load of,662.079,5.041,667.12,neutral
individual food items but the overall,664.48,5.52,670.0,neutral
glycemic load of the whole meal,667.12,5.68,672.8,neutral
let's suppose with our mashed potatoes,670.0,5.36,675.36,neutral
together with two slices of white bread,672.8,5.76,678.56,neutral
and a can of coke or let's imagine,675.36,5.12,680.48,neutral
eating the same mashed potato,678.56,4.64,683.1999999999999,neutral
with just one slice of whole wheat bread,680.48,4.24,684.72,neutral
with turkey and salad,683.2,4.48,687.6800000000001,neutral
and a can of diet coke what do you think,684.72,3.679,688.399,neutral
would become,687.68,3.279,690.959,neutral
of the glycemic load of the whole meal,688.399,4.321,692.72,neutral
in the first scenario we have combined,690.959,3.681,694.64,neutral
the high glycemic index food,692.72,4.16,696.88,neutral
our mashed potatoes with two other,694.64,3.84,698.48,neutral
glycemic index foods,696.88,3.92,700.8,neutral
white bread and coke so we have turned,698.48,4.4,702.88,neutral
our meal into a glycemic bond,700.8,3.84,704.64,neutral
which will make our blood glucose and,702.88,3.68,706.56,neutral
insulin skyrocket,704.64,3.68,708.3199999999999,neutral
in the other scenario we have,706.56,4.32,710.88,neutral
compensated the high glycemic index of,708.32,3.68,712.0,neutral
mashed potatoes,710.88,3.6,714.48,neutral
with the fiber and protein rich low,712.0,4.639,716.639,NA
glycemic index whole wheat bread,714.48,4.56,719.04,NA
green salad and turkey sandwich and a,716.639,5.2,721.839,NA
sugar-free glycemic neutral diet coke,719.04,5.12,724.16,NA
thus lowering the glycemic load of the,721.839,3.201,725.0400000000001,NA
whole meal,724.16,4.239,728.399,NA
so our pancreas will say thanks we will,725.04,5.52,730.56,NA
go over food sources of carbs i will,728.399,3.921,732.32,NA
show you some more glycemic index,730.56,3.12,733.68,NA
numerical values,732.32,3.84,736.1600000000001,NA
but make no mistake i'm not suggesting,733.68,4.32,738.0,NA
that anybody should calculate the,736.16,3.919,740.079,NA
glycemic index and glycemic loads of,738.0,3.2,741.2,NA
their meals,740.079,2.801,742.88,NA
we said at the beginning of our course,741.2,3.52,744.72,NA
that no one should eat with tables and,742.88,3.04,745.92,NA
calculators,744.72,3.679,748.399,NA
besides if the concept of glycemic index,745.92,3.44,749.36,NA
is impeccable,748.399,3.361,751.76,NA
its numerical quantitation is rather,749.36,4.159,753.519,NA
unprecise and variable,751.76,4.24,756.0,NA
it's not just a problem of methodology,753.519,4.961,758.48,NA
food in itself is highly variable,756.0,5.279,761.279,NA
a carrot grown in italy can be extremely,758.48,5.12,763.6,NA
different from a carrot grown in the u.s,761.279,4.401,765.68,NA
different varieties different soil,763.6,4.08,767.6800000000001,NA
different products used to grow it,765.68,4.24,769.92,NA
different weather and so on and then,767.68,4.399,772.079,NA
when it comes to food preparation such,769.92,3.919,773.8389999999999,NA
as cookies or bread,772.079,3.601,775.68,NA
we also have different ingredients,773.839,3.44,777.2790000000001,NA
different proportions different,775.68,3.52,779.1999999999999,NA
processing technologies,777.279,4.321,781.6,NA
different cooking times or temperatures,779.2,4.319,783.519,NA
you already know that all these factors,781.6,3.44,785.0400000000001,NA
can greatly influence,783.519,4.56,788.079,NA
the glycemic index if we insist on the,785.04,5.599,790.639,NA
concept of glycemic index and glycemic,788.079,3.121,791.1999999999999,NA
load,790.639,2.32,792.9590000000001,NA
it's because they are very useful to,791.2,4.079,795.279,NA
have an idea of the general metabolic,792.959,4.081,797.04,NA
effect of different foods on blood,795.279,3.041,798.32,NA
glucose and insulin,797.04,3.52,800.56,NA
but certainly not to make numerical,798.32,4.079,802.399,NA
calculations,800.56,4.48,805.04,NA
so to recap the glycemic index is an,802.399,4.801,807.2,NA
indicator that tells us how fast the,805.04,3.359,808.399,NA
carbs in a food,807.2,3.92,811.12,NA
are digested absorbed and raised blood,808.399,4.081,812.48,NA
glucose levels,811.12,3.36,814.48,NA
it is determined as a blood glucose,812.48,4.479,816.9590000000001,NA
response after eating a specific food,814.48,4.32,818.8000000000001,NA
compared to the response after eating a,816.959,3.041,820.0,NA
standard food,818.8,3.44,822.24,NA
glucose or white bread providing an,820.0,4.56,824.56,NA
equivalent amount of carbohydrates,822.24,4.959,827.199,NA
not an equivalent amount of food the,824.56,3.839,828.399,NA
glycine index,827.199,4.0,831.199,NA
only tells us how fast the carbs in a,828.399,3.361,831.76,NA
food,831.199,4.08,835.279,NA
raise glycemia not how much for that,831.76,5.439,837.199,NA
we must also know how much carb is,835.279,4.0,839.279,NA
inside a serving of that food,837.199,3.921,841.12,NA
combining these two pieces of,839.279,3.601,842.88,NA
information we can determine the,841.12,4.24,845.36,NA
glycemic load of our meals,842.88,5.04,847.92,NA
the general rule is that the glycemic,845.36,4.479,849.839,NA
load of all of our meals should be as,847.92,3.359,851.279,NA
slow as possible,849.839,3.68,853.519,NA
we can accomplish this primarily in two,851.279,3.041,854.32,NA
ways,853.519,4.081,857.6,NA
one by choosing low glycemic index foods,854.32,6.56,860.88,NA
or two by combining high glycemic index,857.6,3.84,861.44,NA
foods,860.88,2.88,863.76,NA
with low glycemic index fiber and,861.44,4.88,866.32,NA
protein rich foods to lower the glycemic,863.76,2.96,866.72,NA
load,866.32,5.519,871.839,NA
of the overall meal,866.72,5.119,871.839,NA
