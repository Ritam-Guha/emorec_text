in the late 70s dr david jenkins of the university of toronto realized that knowing the total amount of carbs in foods was not enough to predict the effects of these sugars on blood glucose,0.719,21.439999999999998,22.159,NA
fluctuations knowing the type of carbs containing a food simple sugars or complex carbohydrates provided some clues but was far from,12.48,18.88,31.36,NA
sufficient to make a correct prediction there are some foods that are rich in complex starches such as white bread that raise blood glucose quickly and abruptly whereas some fruits rich in,21.199,19.601,40.8,NA
simple sugars such as blueberries barely raise blood glucose at all in 1981 jenkins and co-workers published a landmark,31.84,18.718,50.558,angry
article in the american journal of clinical nutrition in which they proposed a new indicator that was able to measure the speed at which sugars containing a specific food,40.879,21.921999999999997,62.800999999999995,angry
would raise blood glucose and they call this indicator glycemic index propelled by numerous findings about the detrimental effects of repeated and elevated blood glucose,51.52,20.238,71.75800000000001,angry
and insulin peaks and their risk for fat accumulation obesity diabetes and cardiovascular disease the concept of glycemic index soon,62.239,17.921999999999997,80.161,neutral
became very popular the higher the glycemic index of a food the faster its carbs enter the bloodstream and raise blood glucose causing the pancreas,70.88,20.639,91.51899999999999,angry
to release insulin you may wonder how this index is calculated in a few words here's how you take a solution of 50 grams of glucose in water and you give it to a group of,80.72,19.601000000000003,100.321,angry
individuals then for the next two hours you draw a drop of blood by finger puncture at regular intervals and you measure blood glucose,91.36,16.478,107.838,angry
concentrations in this example you see that blood glucose peaks between 30 minutes and 1 hour and after 2 hours is almost back to,99.439,16.322,115.761,angry
baseline if you measure the area below this curve you know it's proportional to the amount of glucose that was in the bloodstream during these,107.68,16.799000000000003,124.47900000000001,angry
two hours then you take the same subjects and you have them eat a test food say a bowl of lentils in such an amount that the quantity of,116.079,17.76,133.839,neutral
carbs they contain is still 50 grams let me stress this again you're not giving them 50 grams of lentils but a serving of lentils that provides,125.04,17.84,142.88,neutral
50 grams of carbs now you do the same measurement and in this example you see that the peak is about at the same time but it's much lower,133.599,16.241,149.83999999999997,neutral
and it doesn't decline as fast of course different people will respond in different ways but this doesn't matter because you can use the first measurement to standardize,141.36,16.559,157.919,neutral
the result so you calculate the area under the curve for your lentils and divide it by the area you obtain for the solution of glucose,150.319,17.761,168.07999999999998,neutral
times 100 to get rid of the decimals and there you have your glycemic index of lentils if you have worked well you will get very similar numbers in all your,158.48,18.4,176.88,neutral
different subjects to complicate things some labs have chosen not to use glucose in water as a standard but white bread this has advantages and,168.16,20.16,188.32,neutral
disadvantages whose discussion goes beyond the scope of our course just keep in mind that you cannot compare gi numbers from different tables if they are calculated using different,178.0,19.519000000000002,197.519,neutral
standards the numbers i will show you here are all calculated using glucose as a standard the concept of glycemic index is,188.239,21.28,209.519,neutral
often misunderstood so let me clarify a very important point the glycemic index is a measure of the speed at which the carbs in a food raise blood,198.0,20.080000000000002,218.08,neutral
glucose levels it is not a measure of the extent of this effect because the glycemic index is independent of the amounts of carb,208.959,19.441,228.4,neutral
contained in a food think of a man target shooting with a gun the glycemic index would tell us how fast he shoots his bullets but he does not tell us how many bullets,217.76,19.438,237.19799999999998,neutral
he has to shoot if he only has a few bullets he can shoot them as fast as he wants but he'll still not be very deadly so the glycemic index only makes sense,228.319,21.921999999999997,250.24099999999999,neutral
if we consider it together with another piece of information which is the amount of carbs contained in that food for example carrots have a relatively,238.72,18.159,256.879,neutral
high glycemic index but they also have very little sugar this means their sugar enters the bloodstream fast but because it's very small amount,248.159,17.919999999999998,266.079,neutral
the overall effect of carrots on blood glucose and insulin release is minimal conversely the glycemic index of potatoes is lower than that of carrots,256.799,18.16,274.959,neutral
but while an average carrot has about four grams of carbs an average potato has about 25 grams so even if these carbs are absorbed more slowly they still have a significant,266.08,21.201,287.281,neutral
effect on blood glucose and insulin because they are a lot to take into account was the glycemic index and the total amount of carbs,276.8,18.24,295.04,neutral
a group of researchers from harvard university proposed in 1997 the concept of glycemic load it is very simple it's just a glycemic index of a food,285.6,22.4,308.0,neutral
times the amount of digestible carbs contained in a standard serving of that food divided by 100 just to get rid of some zeros,296.72,16.96,313.68,neutral
this way you have an index that considers both factors if a food has a low gi but a lot of sugars its glycemic load will still be high,305.52,18.0,323.52,neutral
conversely if it has a high glycemic index but very few sugars its glycemic load will still be relatively low,314.96,17.358999999999998,332.31899999999996,neutral
let's go back to our previous example and let's consider a glycemic index of 72 for carrots and of 63 for boiled potatoes the glycemic load over carrot would be,322.96,22.16,345.12,neutral
72 times 4 grams of carbs divided by 103 the glycemic load of our potato would be 63 times 25 grams of carbs divided by 116. so the glycemic load of our potato is,333.919,27.68,361.599,neutral
more than five fold the glycemic load of our carrot even though its glycemic index is slower watermelon also has a high glycemic index of 72,347.919,21.999999999999996,369.919,neutral
but a slice of 120 grams only has 6 grams of sugar so its glycemic load is 4. a banana of the same weight has a much lower glycemic index 52,358.319,22.319999999999997,380.639,neutral
but it has 20 grams of carbs so its glycemic load is 11 almost three times that of watermelon of course the glycemic load has one big disadvantage,370.0,19.761,389.761,neutral
compared to the glycemic index the glycemic index is always the same independent of the amount of food the glycemic load is always based on a specific amount of food if i,380.0,22.157999999999998,402.158,neutral
eat three slices of watermelon the glycemic load would be three times higher while the glycemic index would still be 72.,391.919,20.561999999999998,412.481,neutral
take this coke its glycemic index is 58. a small 100 milliliters glass a meals can or a large 600 meals fast food cup all have a glycemic index of 58 but the,400.72,25.679000000000002,426.399,neutral
small glass has 11 grams of sugar with a glycemic load of 6.4 the can is 37 grams of sugar glycemic load 21.5 and the large cup 67 grams of sugar and a glycemic load of,414.16,27.16,441.32000000000005,neutral
38.9 and by the way 266 calories the composition of a food is of course the first determinant of its glycemic index in particular two,428.199,22.281,450.48,neutral
key factors are the type of carbs and the presence of other nutrients as far as simple sugars are concerned glucose raises the glycemic index,439.52,21.359,460.87899999999996,neutral
much more than fructose sucrose is in between since it mixes the two as for complex carbs the more branched starch is the lower the glycemic index because it,449.199,21.6,470.79900000000004,neutral
will take longer to break it down as for other nutrients the presence of fiber proteins and lipids slows down gastric emptying and intestinal absorption of glucose,460.319,20.401,480.72,neutral
thus lowering the glycemic index of a food it is easy to understand why whole grains and their derivative products have lower glycemic indexes than their refined counterparts,470.56,22.56,493.12,neutral
but many other factors affect the glycemic index of a food including preparation processing and cooking let's consider our potato again if we,481.84,19.2,501.03999999999996,neutral
snack on it raw its glycemic index will be close to zero because the starch of a raw potato is almost entirely undigestible so it will travel,492.08,19.92,512.0,neutral
intact through our small intestine without absorption if we boil that potato its glycemic index will quickly raise to about 60 because starch gelatinizes with,501.44,20.478,521.918,neutral
heat and becomes easily digestible if however we eat that same potato with its skin its fiber will slow down glucose digestion and,512.479,18.642,531.1210000000001,neutral
absorption and as a result its gi will be lower conversely if we turn that potato into a mashed potato its gi will further raise because starch,521.44,21.04,542.48,neutral
becomes even more accessible to our digestive enzymes which will convert it to glucose even faster finally if we don't eat our potato at,532.32,19.279999999999998,551.6,neutral
all and just leave it there at room temp within a few hours its starch will start retrogradation becoming less and less digestible and its gi will progressively decrease,541.04,21.04,562.0799999999999,neutral
together with the desirability of our potato which will become less and less soft and buttery the degree of cooking always matters if raw pasta has a glycemic index close,551.76,20.719,572.479,neutral
to zero al dente pasta the way we italians like it still somewhat firm has a gi of about 50 because part of its starch is still harder to digest,562.64,22.560000000000002,585.2,neutral
conversely overcooked pasta to the point it becomes soft that you somehow appear to like has a gi about 10 points higher because its starch,573.2,18.32,591.5200000000001,neutral
turns to glucose much faster some technological processes also fragment starch raising gi such as extrusion to make potato chips or corn flakes,582.08,23.281,605.361,neutral
or pressure steaming to make puffed rice as far as fruit is concerned the degree of ripeness influences the gi as the fruit ripens its acids are converted to sugars the,593.44,23.92,617.36,neutral
texture becomes softer and the gi tends to increase an overripe banana will have a higher glycemic index that one that's still green and then of course peeling fruits and veggies,606.24,24.238000000000003,630.4780000000001,neutral
always raises the gi because you remove a lot of fiber whenever we cut blend puree or in any way turn the food into smaller pieces the work of digestive enzymes is easier,618.079,22.882,640.9609999999999,neutral
and glucose absorption is faster so the gi increases if you turn your bottle of lentils into a lentil puree its gi will be higher if you juice a carrot,629.6,22.16,651.76,neutral
carrot juice will have a much higher gi than the whole carrot and so on so far we have talked about individual foods but it is important to remember that most of the time we,640.72,20.799999999999997,661.52,neutral
combine different foods in a meal when we do that these foods mix in our stomach and get digested and absorbed together so what,650.88,17.838,668.718,neutral
really matters in the end is not the glycemic index or the glycemic load of individual food items but the overall glycemic load of the whole meal let's suppose with our mashed potatoes,660.079,26.002,686.0809999999999,neutral
together with two slices of white bread and a can of coke or let's imagine eating the same mashed potato with just one slice of whole wheat bread with turkey and salad,672.8,24.24,697.04,neutral
and a can of diet coke what do you think would become of the glycemic load of the whole meal in the first scenario we have combined the high glycemic index food,684.72,19.12,703.84,neutral
our mashed potatoes with two other glycemic index foods white bread and coke so we have turned our meal into a glycemic bond which will make our blood glucose and,694.64,19.68,714.3199999999999,neutral
insulin skyrocket in the other scenario we have compensated the high glycemic index of mashed potatoes with the fiber and protein rich low,704.64,19.919,724.559,neutral
glycemic index whole wheat bread green salad and turkey sandwich and a sugar-free glycemic neutral diet coke thus lowering the glycemic load of the whole meal,714.48,22.32,736.8000000000001,NA
so our pancreas will say thanks we will go over food sources of carbs i will show you some more glycemic index numerical values but make no mistake i'm not suggesting,725.04,20.721,745.761,NA
that anybody should calculate the glycemic index and glycemic loads of their meals we said at the beginning of our course that no one should eat with tables and,736.16,16.48,752.64,NA
calculators besides if the concept of glycemic index is impeccable its numerical quantitation is rather unprecise and variable,744.72,18.878999999999998,763.599,NA
it's not just a problem of methodology food in itself is highly variable a carrot grown in italy can be extremely different from a carrot grown in the u.s different varieties different soil,753.519,23.841,777.36,NA
different products used to grow it different weather and so on and then when it comes to food preparation such as cookies or bread we also have different ingredients,765.68,19.599,785.279,NA
different proportions different processing technologies different cooking times or temperatures you already know that all these factors can greatly influence,775.68,20.16,795.8399999999999,NA
the glycemic index if we insist on the concept of glycemic index and glycemic load it's because they are very useful to have an idea of the general metabolic,785.04,19.2,804.24,NA
effect of different foods on blood glucose and insulin but certainly not to make numerical calculations so to recap the glycemic index is an,795.279,19.921,815.2,NA
indicator that tells us how fast the carbs in a food are digested absorbed and raised blood glucose levels it is determined as a blood glucose,805.04,19.198999999999998,824.2389999999999,NA
response after eating a specific food compared to the response after eating a standard food glucose or white bread providing an equivalent amount of carbohydrates,814.48,20.32,834.8000000000001,NA
not an equivalent amount of food the glycine index only tells us how fast the carbs in a food raise glycemia not how much for that,824.56,20.719,845.279,NA
we must also know how much carb is inside a serving of that food combining these two pieces of information we can determine the glycemic load of our meals,835.279,20.802,856.081,NA
the general rule is that the glycemic load of all of our meals should be as slow as possible we can accomplish this primarily in two ways,845.36,18.64,864.0,NA
one by choosing low glycemic index foods or two by combining high glycemic index foods with low glycemic index fiber and protein rich foods to lower the glycemic,854.32,21.119999999999997,875.44,NA
load of the overall meal,866.32,10.638,876.9580000000001,NA
