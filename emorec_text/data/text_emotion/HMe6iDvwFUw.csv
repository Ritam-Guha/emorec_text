"I'm Shelby Cullinan with today's health news. At first glance it's hard to see a connection
between sleep hormones and type 2 diabetes. New research from Sweden's Lund University,
however, found that melatonin impaired insulin secretion in certain people. Previous research showed that a gene variant
on melatonin receptor B1 increases the risk",3.449,22.501,25.950000000000003,sad
"of type 2 diabetes. The gene variant increases the effect of the
melatonin receptor on insulin cells. As a result, the cells become less sensitive
to insulin, which increases the risk of elevated blood sugar. The research team found that those who carried
the risk gene had significantly lower insulin",25.95,19.61,45.56,sad

in blood sugar after three months of melatonin treatment. Those with the carrier gene, however, were
much more likely to have higher blood sugars. Speak to your doctor for more information.",45.56,15.088999999999999,60.649,NA
