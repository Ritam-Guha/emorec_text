I went to Indiana University,114.392,1.522,115.914,NA

I walked into the classroom,120.291,1.656,121.947,NA

our disection of these bodies,165.741,1.716,167.45700000000002,NA

When I got to the internal body cavities,174.244,1.579,175.823,NA
it was amazing to me,175.823,1.417,177.24,NA

they broke off into my hand.,202.802,2.929,205.731,NA
So I finished grad school,206.607,2.241,208.848,NA

I went back to the operational Army,213.531,1.522,215.053,NA

as a Division Commander in 2009,222.737,3.756,226.493,NA

to three-star General,228.974,1.185,230.159,NA
I think because they wanted to prove,230.159,1.584,231.743,sad
they have a sense of humor.,231.743,1.472,233.215,NA
They then sent me to be the Commander of,233.215,2.894,236.109,NA
Initial Military Training.,236.109,2.343,238.452,NA

disturbed me.,252.604,1.579,254.18300000000002,NA
Several facts came to my attention.,254.183,1.801,255.98399999999998,NA
"First of all, 75% or more",255.984,4.36,260.344,NA
a little bit more actually,260.344,1.197,261.541,NA

"75% of the 17-24 year olds 
who wanted to join the Army",267.892,3.992,271.884,NA
were not qualified,271.884,1.381,273.265,NA
and the number one reason,273.265,1.017,274.282,neutral
was because they were obese.,274.282,2.234,276.51599999999996,sad
Of the 25% that could join the Army,276.516,2.48,278.99600000000004,NA
what we found on the first day of basic training,278.996,2.335,281.33099999999996,NA
was that about 60% of them,281.331,2.93,284.261,NA
could not pass the PT test,284.261,3.11,287.37100000000004,NA
that we gave on the first day.,287.371,1.686,289.05699999999996,NA

"coming off the civilian environment,",299.253,1.967,301.21999999999997,NA

I couldn't understand what had happened.,303.868,1.776,305.644,sad

studying physical education in 1986.,308.026,4.341,312.367,sad
As we did some analyses,312.367,1.367,313.73400000000004,sad
I realized that a couple of things had changed.,313.734,3.323,317.05699999999996,NA
"First of all, number one
and the primary reason was",317.057,3.74,320.797,NA
starting in the late '90s,320.797,1.23,322.02700000000004,NA

"but what does the Army care about that?""",342.273,2.468,344.74100000000004,NA
"Well, we're getting the product of that",344.741,1.933,346.674,sad
but in addition to second and third order effects,346.674,2.204,348.878,NA
were young people that were joining our service,348.878,2.215,351.09299999999996,NA
"could not run, dodge, jump, tumble, roll",351.093,2.757,353.85,NA

if they're in combat.,356.83,1.409,358.239,NA
The second thing we found,358.239,2.146,360.385,NA
or that I found or realized was,360.385,1.991,362.376,NA
that our diet had changed radically,362.376,2.884,365.26,NA
in the last 15 years.,365.26,1.905,367.16499999999996,NA

"that's not the case there,",371.63,1.433,373.063,NA

And that was having a deleterious effect.,382.893,3.021,385.914,NA

"that we were also seeing,",387.678,2.333,390.011,NA
"a scientist told me,",390.011,1.695,391.706,NA

of a lack of physical education",406.339,3.041,409.38,NA
and an increase of poor nutrition,409.38,3.458,412.838,NA

"femoral neck stress injuries,",448.444,3.3,451.744,NA
