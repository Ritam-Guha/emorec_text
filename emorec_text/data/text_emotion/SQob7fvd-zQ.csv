super sick of eggs and they were asking,6.96,2.559,9.519,fear
for,9.2,2.559,11.759,happy
breakfast recipes that can still get,9.519,3.761,13.280000000000001,happy
good blood sugar so today i'm going to,11.759,1.92,13.679,happy

a list of breakfast ideas that aren't,13.679,3.041,16.72,happy
eggs,16.16,2.24,18.4,surprise
that will still get good blood sugar,16.72,3.36,20.08,surprise

that i continuously add to for,20.08,2.8,22.88,happy
gestational diabetes so if you like,21.52,2.32,23.84,happy
videos like these,22.88,2.639,25.519,happy
please subscribe hit the notification,23.84,3.12,26.96,happy
bell and share this video with another,25.519,3.201,28.72,happy
community of moms who has gestational,26.96,2.559,29.519000000000002,fear
diabetes,28.72,3.839,32.559,surprise
the first one is porridge so you may not,29.519,4.961,34.48,fear
be able to have the quick,32.559,4.0,36.559,fear
porridge because of the higher glycemic,34.48,3.84,38.31999999999999,fear
index but you might do better with,36.559,3.68,40.239,fear
a little bit of steel cut oats or even,38.32,3.28,41.6,fear
large flake oats,40.239,2.801,43.04,fear
but if you're still struggling with your,41.6,3.119,44.719,surprise
blood sugar after that then,43.04,3.999,47.039,fear
you may do better with note meal which,44.719,3.441,48.160000000000004,fear
is made with,47.039,4.081,51.120000000000005,fear
nuts and almond flour and coconut flour,48.16,4.32,52.48,fear
and i'm going to link to that in the,51.12,3.439,54.559,fear
description box below and you could add,52.48,3.44,55.919999999999995,fear
low glycemic index,54.559,3.52,58.079,fear
berries or you could add one of the,55.92,3.439,59.359,fear
sweeteners that doesn't increase your,58.079,2.96,61.039,happy
blood sugar so that would be equal,59.359,4.081,63.440000000000005,fear
or splenda and those are artificial,61.039,4.321,65.36,fear
sweeteners i actually prefer,63.44,4.32,67.75999999999999,fear
something like stevia or monk fruit,65.36,5.04,70.4,happy
which are made from plants so stevia is,67.76,4.399,72.159,happy
a green leafy plant i used to grow it in,70.4,3.92,74.32000000000001,happy
my garden dehydrate it and that sweetens,72.159,4.161,76.32000000000001,happy
food but you can also buy,74.32,4.64,78.96,happy
the drops from the store or monk fruit,76.32,4.56,80.88,fear
is a berry that comes from china and it,78.96,3.839,82.79899999999999,fear
also doesn't increase blood sugar,80.88,4.96,85.83999999999999,fear
as well okay so the next one is waffles,82.799,3.281,86.08000000000001,fear
or,85.84,2.08,87.92,surprise
pancakes so again you can kind of get,86.08,4.079,90.15899999999999,surprise
keto versions or make keto versions of,87.92,4.08,92.0,fear
these so i know kodiak,90.159,3.6,93.759,fear

group are enjoying,95.439,3.121,98.55999999999999,fear
but you can also make them with almond,96.4,4.399,100.799,fear
flour and cottage cheese,98.56,4.08,102.64,fear
and again they're really delicious and,100.799,4.401,105.2,fear
similar to the oatmeal you could add,102.64,5.839,108.479,fear
fruit or berries you could add,105.2,7.04,112.24000000000001,fear
for example unsweetened greek yogurt or,108.479,4.241,112.72,happy
even an,112.24,2.159,114.399,happy
unsweetened whipped cream to make it,112.72,3.359,116.079,happy
really delicious or use any of the,114.399,3.04,117.43900000000001,happy
sweeteners that don't increase your,116.079,2.241,118.32,surprise
blood sugar,117.439,2.96,120.39899999999999,fear
okay so if you're craving something like,118.32,3.28,121.6,fear

well but doesn't contain raw egg,128.64,4.88,133.51999999999998,fear
which makes it safe during pregnancy the,130.56,4.319,134.879,fear

chia,150.48,2.8,153.28,
raspberry pudding which is delicious you,151.12,3.6,154.72,
can make it the day before and it can be,153.28,2.48,155.76,happy
ready to go,154.72,3.92,158.64,fear

breakfast smoothie so i'm going to link,160.239,3.761,164.0,happy

if you have something like chicken or,174.959,4.881,179.84,fear
meat and even a little bit of sweet,176.8,4.719,181.519,fear
potato from the night before you could,179.84,2.8,182.64000000000001,fear
make that into,181.519,2.881,184.4,happy
a breakfast pretty easily by just,182.64,3.44,186.07999999999998,happy
warming it up again i hope that gave you,184.4,2.88,187.28,happy
some breakfast ideas,186.08,3.439,189.519,happy
we do tend to struggle with blood sugars,187.28,4.08,191.36,fear
earlier in the morning as we sleep we,189.519,2.961,192.48000000000002,fear
produce hormones,191.36,3.04,194.4,happy
and these hormones cause insulin,192.48,4.399,196.879,happy
resistance so our insulin isn't able to,194.4,3.6,198.0,fear
move our sugar from,196.879,3.841,200.72,fear
our blood stream into our cells as,198.0,4.159,202.159,fear
easily in the morning hours,200.72,4.48,205.2,fear
so some women do find it more helpful to,202.159,4.321,206.48,fear
help control their sugars,205.2,3.119,208.319,fear
by having a lower carb amount at,206.48,3.44,209.92,fear
breakfast so if you're looking for more,208.319,3.041,211.35999999999999,fear

search search up keto breakfast ideas,211.36,3.439,214.799,fear

add in the amount of carb that you,214.799,3.841,218.64000000000001,happy
decided with your dietitian or your,216.64,3.04,219.67999999999998,happy

some women can handle up to 45 grams of,219.68,4.479,224.15900000000002,happy
carbohydrate at breakfast but this isn't,222.08,2.879,224.959,happy
necessary,224.159,2.72,226.879,fear
and i find a lot of women do better if,224.959,3.761,228.72,fear
