of intestine that comes with the pancreas organ to the

the bladder, but we really don't do that procedure anymore, because the patients
tolerate it",44.9,23.53,68.43,NA

quality of life is primarily focused upon normalizing
someone's glucose control. Patients who are typically undergoing a

diabetes.",168.8,22.33,191.13,neutral

their glucoses should become normal, and they avoid both the lows and the highs and
have excellent glucose control. Long term the advantage of that is that

either reversed or minimized. [MUSIC]",192.17,25.406,217.576,neutral

operation it is probably mostly a function of us being able to monitor the kidney, to
pick up on problems related to rejection. It's hard to track rejection of the
pancreas, whereas it's easier to track rejection of
