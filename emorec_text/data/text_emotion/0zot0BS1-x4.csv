well i think,2.48,3.279,5.759,sad
in most cases we first want to assess,3.12,4.239,7.359,sad
the tumor and and see if this is,5.759,4.241,10.0,sad
amenable to surgical resection,7.359,4.801,12.16,sad
smaller tumors like microadenomas that,10.0,3.84,13.84,sad
are less than a centimeter,12.16,3.84,16.0,surprise
uh there's more likelihood of a cure,13.84,3.199,17.039,surprise
unfortunately,16.0,3.199,19.198999999999998,surprise
about two-thirds of these patients have,17.039,3.681,20.720000000000002,sad
very large tumors,19.199,3.201,22.400000000000002,sad
more than a centimeter and some of them,20.72,3.6,24.32,sad
can be very invasive,22.4,4.16,26.56,surprise
and so surgical cure cannot always be,24.32,3.6,27.92,surprise
attained but,26.56,3.44,30.0,surprise
certainly in many cases we do try to,27.92,3.279,31.199,surprise
debulk the tumor,30.0,4.32,34.32,surprise
and provide some amount of growth,31.199,4.321,35.52,surprise
hormone control,34.32,2.96,37.28,surprise
and then after that we have to consider,35.52,3.68,39.2,surprise
if that patient would be,37.28,4.56,41.84,surprise
a candidate for radiotherapy or if we,39.2,5.6,44.800000000000004,sad
should try medical therapy,41.84,4.64,46.480000000000004,fear
you know radiotherapy has its own,44.8,3.36,48.16,neutral
problems in the sense that it,46.48,4.8,51.279999999999994,surprise
takes uh years for that to take effect,48.16,5.84,54.0,surprise
so even if you see that a patient would,51.28,5.279,56.559,surprise
benefit from that we still have to,54.0,5.52,59.519999999999996,surprise
control the disease in the meantime and,56.559,4.881,61.44,surprise
also radiotherapy can lead to some,59.52,3.84,63.36,surprise
issues with,61.44,2.999,64.439,surprise
[Music],63.36,3.68,67.04,sad
hypopituitarism where now the rest of,64.439,5.481,69.91999999999999,sad
the pituitary can also be damaged and so,67.04,5.36,72.4,neutral
oftentimes we will move on to a medical,69.92,5.44,75.36,neutral
therapy to control this disease,72.4,6.16,78.56,sad
we really have two,75.36,5.84,81.2,sad
uh approved medications to treat,78.56,3.52,82.08,surprise
acromegaly,81.2,3.04,84.24000000000001,surprise
the first are somatostatin receptor,82.08,3.359,85.439,surprise
ligands,84.24,3.199,87.439,surprise
which bind to a receptor on the surface,85.439,3.281,88.72,surprise
of the tumor,87.439,4.401,91.83999999999999,sad
and that turns down growth hormone,88.72,4.24,92.96,sad
secretion,91.84,3.12,94.96000000000001,surprise
it can also cause shrinkage of the tumor,92.96,4.56,97.52,surprise
so it can lead to better tumor control,94.96,6.32,101.28,neutral
and it does that by leading to apoptosis,97.52,5.76,103.28,neutral
of some of those cells,101.28,4.72,106.0,surprise
we have a second therapy which is a,103.28,5.119,108.399,surprise
growth hormone receptor antagonist,106.0,4.96,110.96,surprise
that requires daily injections and that,108.399,4.961,113.36,neutral
decreases the igf-1 production from the,110.96,3.439,114.399,neutral
liver,113.36,2.96,116.32,neutral
the major problem with these symptoms,114.399,3.121,117.52,neutral
and signs,116.32,3.36,119.67999999999999,neutral
however it doesn't lead to tumor control,117.52,3.84,121.36,neutral
because it's not targeted at the tumor,119.68,2.079,121.759,neutral
level,121.36,1.92,123.28,neutral
it's targeted at the growth hormone,121.759,8.081,129.84,surprise
receptor level in the tissues,123.28,6.56,129.84,surprise
