well i think in most cases we first want to assess the tumor and and see if this is amenable to surgical resection smaller tumors like microadenomas that,2.48,20.400000000000002,22.880000000000003,angry
are less than a centimeter uh there's more likelihood of a cure unfortunately about two-thirds of these patients have very large tumors,12.16,17.12,29.28,angry
more than a centimeter and some of them can be very invasive and so surgical cure cannot always be attained but certainly in many cases we do try to,20.72,18.079,38.799,angry
debulk the tumor and provide some amount of growth hormone control and then after that we have to consider if that patient would be,30.0,19.840999999999998,49.840999999999994,angry
a candidate for radiotherapy or if we should try medical therapy you know radiotherapy has its own problems in the sense that it takes uh years for that to take effect,39.2,24.24,63.44,angry
so even if you see that a patient would benefit from that we still have to control the disease in the meantime and also radiotherapy can lead to some issues with,51.28,22.519,73.799,angry
[Music] hypopituitarism where now the rest of the pituitary can also be damaged and so oftentimes we will move on to a medical therapy to control this disease,63.36,26.121000000000002,89.481,angry
we really have two uh approved medications to treat acromegaly the first are somatostatin receptor ligands,75.36,18.958,94.318,angry
which bind to a receptor on the surface of the tumor and that turns down growth hormone secretion it can also cause shrinkage of the tumor,85.439,19.602,105.041,angry
so it can lead to better tumor control and it does that by leading to apoptosis of some of those cells we have a second therapy which is a growth hormone receptor antagonist,94.96,26.879,121.839,angry
that requires daily injections and that decreases the igf-1 production from the liver the major problem with these symptoms and signs,108.399,17.841,126.24000000000001,angry
however it doesn't lead to tumor control because it's not targeted at the tumor level it's targeted at the growth hormone receptor level in the tissues,117.52,22.48,140.0,angry
