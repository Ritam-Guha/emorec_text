my name is st√©phanie apt and today we're,0.03,5.13,5.16,
going to discuss the difference between,2.939,5.311,8.25,
Medicare supplement plans and Medicare,5.16,8.16,13.32,
Advantage plans so there are two main,8.25,7.32,15.57,
parts to Original Medicare Part A and,13.32,4.379,17.698999999999998,happy
Part B and that will be right there on,15.57,3.66,19.23,happy
your red white and blue Medicare card,17.699,4.261,21.96,happy
Part A which is your hospital coverage,19.23,4.469,23.699,happy
is usually free as long as you've been,21.96,3.87,25.830000000000002,happy
working in the United States for ten,23.699,6.0,29.699,happy
years Part B which is your doctor or,25.83,7.499,33.329,happy
your medical coverage most people pay a,29.699,6.661,36.36,happy
monthly premium for so most people pay a,33.329,5.16,38.489000000000004,happy
standard monthly premium with one,36.36,3.57,39.93,happy
hundred and thirty four dollars per,38.489,5.281,43.769999999999996,happy
month is the standard premium in 2017 to,39.93,7.83,47.76,happy
be on Medicare Part B now once you have,43.77,6.84,50.61,happy
Medicare Part A and Part B you have two,47.76,5.4,53.16,happy
main choices on how you can get your,50.61,5.64,56.25,happy
coverage so the first choice or option,53.16,6.239,59.398999999999994,happy
one is to keep your Original Medicare,56.25,5.34,61.59,happy
benefits Part A and B that you're,59.399,4.531,63.93,happy
receiving through the government and,61.59,4.95,66.54,happy
then from there add on a Medicare Part D,63.93,5.28,69.21,happy
drug plan which will cover your,66.54,4.95,71.49000000000001,happy
prescription medications and then most,69.21,5.22,74.42999999999999,happy
people add on a Medicare supplement or a,71.49,5.94,77.42999999999999,happy
Medigap plan and those plans are,74.43,5.34,79.77000000000001,happy
designed to work right along with your,77.43,4.68,82.11000000000001,happy
Original Medicare benefits of Part A and,79.77,5.58,85.35,happy
B and pay the gaps so those meta gap,82.11,6.06,88.17,happy
plans or Medicare supplement plans pay,85.35,6.18,91.53,happy
the deductibles and coinsurance that,88.17,6.51,94.68,happy
Original Medicare doesn't pay so this,91.53,5.729,97.259,happy
first option that you have this first,94.68,5.46,100.14,happy
path allows you a lot of freedom right,97.259,4.32,101.57900000000001,happy
because you're going with Original,100.14,3.45,103.59,happy
Medicare so you have the freedom to pick,101.579,4.021,105.6,happy
your own doctors and hospitals and,103.59,5.01,108.60000000000001,happy
usually you pay very little to nothing,105.6,6.0,111.6,happy
at the doctor or hospital because the,108.6,5.129,113.729,surprise
Medigap or Medicare supplement plans are,111.6,5.1,116.69999999999999,surprise
designed to fill in the gaps they pay,113.729,5.25,118.979,neutral
the deductibles the coinsurance so that,116.7,4.32,121.02000000000001,neutral
you're responsible for very little,118.979,4.17,123.149,happy
out-of-pocket if you do get sick if you,121.02,3.419,124.439,happy
go to the doctor if you go to the,123.149,5.011,128.16,happy
hospital now the other option or option,124.439,6.801,131.23999999999998,happy
number two is to go with a med,128.16,6.23,134.39,happy
