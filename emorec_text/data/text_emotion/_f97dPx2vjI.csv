so diabetes is a very common problem today we see that almost 14% or 15% of people have diabetes and every other person that you see may have diabetes so every very often we have this question,5.029,25.689999999999998,30.718999999999998,neutral
what is normal blood glucose level because apart from diabetes we also have a condition called as pre-diabetes that is where there is a high risk of developing diabetes but that is actually,18.359,18.75,37.109,neutral
not there so what is normal blood glucose level is if you look at the fasting blood sugar level if you if you give the blood sample in the fasting stage and if the fasting glucose level,27.33,22.17,49.5,neutral
is less than hundred it is normal if it is between 100 to 125 then what is this is what is called as pre-diabetes and above 126 your dial you are having diabetes similarly if you look at the,38.219,24.661,62.88,neutral
post prandial that is or two hours after a meal if you give a blood sample and if the blood sugar value is less than 140 it is totally normal if it is more than 200 then the person can you can say that,50.67,22.468999999999998,73.139,neutral
the person has diabetes and between 140 to 200 is what is called as pre-diabetes so these people who have pre-diabetes have levels which are slightly higher than normal but they don't have as high,61.949,23.011,84.96,neutral
levels as diabetes and these people are have a high risk of developing damage so if anybody has this pre-diabetes then we should try to see that they prevent they do not develop diabetes and we can,73.35,23.610000000000003,96.96,neutral
prevent diabetes in this situation we can also use the hba1c level to diagnose diabetes and anybody who has a blood sugar level of me on sea level of more than 6.5 can be said to have diabetes,84.57,25.439999999999998,110.00999999999999,neutral
now another important thing is that we should always do these tests on more than one occasion we can't just rely on one test and say that a person has got diabetes we should do it more than once,97.71,21.269,118.97899999999998,NA
and then see whether the consistently it is in that range [Music],108.63,15.149000000000001,123.779,NA
