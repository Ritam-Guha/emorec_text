so diabetes is a very common problem,5.029,5.591,10.620000000000001,angry
today we see that almost 14% or 15% of,7.47,6.48,13.95,fear
people have diabetes and every other,10.62,5.79,16.41,fear
person that you see may have diabetes so,13.95,4.409,18.358999999999998,angry
every very often we have this question,16.41,3.42,19.83,angry
what is normal blood glucose level,18.359,3.631,21.990000000000002,angry
because apart from diabetes we also have,19.83,4.439,24.269,angry
a condition called as pre-diabetes that,21.99,3.48,25.47,angry
is where there is a high risk of,24.269,3.061,27.33,angry
developing diabetes but that is actually,25.47,4.139,29.608999999999998,angry
not there so what is normal blood,27.33,4.17,31.5,angry
glucose level is if you look at the,29.609,4.38,33.989000000000004,angry
fasting blood sugar level if you if you,31.5,4.38,35.88,neutral
give the blood sample in the fasting,33.989,4.23,38.218999999999994,angry
stage and if the fasting glucose level,35.88,5.01,40.89,angry
is less than hundred it is normal if it,38.219,5.401,43.620000000000005,angry
is between 100 to 125 then what is this,40.89,4.47,45.36,angry
is what is called as pre-diabetes and,43.62,4.83,48.449999999999996,angry
above 126 your dial you are having,45.36,5.31,50.67,neutral
diabetes similarly if you look at the,48.45,4.65,53.1,neutral
post prandial that is or two hours after,50.67,4.56,55.230000000000004,neutral
a meal if you give a blood sample and if,53.1,4.32,57.42,angry
the blood sugar value is less than 140,55.23,4.5,59.73,angry
it is totally normal if it is more than,57.42,4.529,61.949,angry
200 then the person can you can say that,59.73,4.56,64.28999999999999,angry
the person has diabetes and between 140,61.949,4.561,66.50999999999999,angry
to 200 is what is called as pre-diabetes,64.29,5.189,69.47900000000001,angry
so these people who have pre-diabetes,66.51,5.16,71.67,angry
have levels which are slightly higher,69.479,3.871,73.35,neutral
than normal but they don't have as high,71.67,4.23,75.9,angry
levels as diabetes and these people are,73.35,5.04,78.39,angry
have a high risk of developing damage so,75.9,4.44,80.34,angry
if anybody has this pre-diabetes then we,78.39,4.74,83.13,angry
should try to see that they prevent they,80.34,4.23,84.57000000000001,angry
do not develop diabetes and we can,83.13,5.16,88.28999999999999,angry
prevent diabetes in this situation we,84.57,6.39,90.96,angry
can also use the hba1c level to diagnose,88.29,4.289,92.57900000000001,angry
diabetes and anybody who has a blood,90.96,3.96,94.91999999999999,angry
sugar level of me on sea level of more,92.579,5.131,97.71,neutral
than 6.5 can be said to have diabetes,94.92,5.67,100.59,
now another important thing is that we,97.71,5.22,102.92999999999999,NA
should always do these tests on more,100.59,3.93,104.52000000000001,NA
than one occasion we can't just rely on,102.93,3.99,106.92,NA
one test and say that a person has got,104.52,4.11,108.63,NA
diabetes we should do it more than once,106.92,4.019,110.93900000000001,NA
and then see whether the consistently it,108.63,4.18,112.81,NA
is in that range,110.939,6.42,117.359,NA
