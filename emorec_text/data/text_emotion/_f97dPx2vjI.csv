so diabetes is a very common problem,5.029,5.591,10.620000000000001,sad
today we see that almost 14% or 15% of,7.47,6.48,13.95,sad
people have diabetes and every other,10.62,5.79,16.41,sad
person that you see may have diabetes so,13.95,4.409,18.358999999999998,sad
every very often we have this question,16.41,3.42,19.83,sad
what is normal blood glucose level,18.359,3.631,21.990000000000002,neutral
because apart from diabetes we also have,19.83,4.439,24.269,neutral
a condition called as pre-diabetes that,21.99,3.48,25.47,neutral
is where there is a high risk of,24.269,3.061,27.33,sad
developing diabetes but that is actually,25.47,4.139,29.608999999999998,sad
not there so what is normal blood,27.33,4.17,31.5,sad
glucose level is if you look at the,29.609,4.38,33.989000000000004,neutral
fasting blood sugar level if you if you,31.5,4.38,35.88,sad
give the blood sample in the fasting,33.989,4.23,38.218999999999994,sad
stage and if the fasting glucose level,35.88,5.01,40.89,sad
is less than hundred it is normal if it,38.219,5.401,43.620000000000005,sad
is between 100 to 125 then what is this,40.89,4.47,45.36,sad
is what is called as pre-diabetes and,43.62,4.83,48.449999999999996,sad
above 126 your dial you are having,45.36,5.31,50.67,sad
diabetes similarly if you look at the,48.45,4.65,53.1,sad
post prandial that is or two hours after,50.67,4.56,55.230000000000004,sad
a meal if you give a blood sample and if,53.1,4.32,57.42,sad
the blood sugar value is less than 140,55.23,4.5,59.73,sad
it is totally normal if it is more than,57.42,4.529,61.949,sad
200 then the person can you can say that,59.73,4.56,64.28999999999999,sad
the person has diabetes and between 140,61.949,4.561,66.50999999999999,sad
to 200 is what is called as pre-diabetes,64.29,5.189,69.47900000000001,neutral
so these people who have pre-diabetes,66.51,5.16,71.67,neutral
have levels which are slightly higher,69.479,3.871,73.35,sad
than normal but they don't have as high,71.67,4.23,75.9,sad
levels as diabetes and these people are,73.35,5.04,78.39,sad
have a high risk of developing damage so,75.9,4.44,80.34,sad
if anybody has this pre-diabetes then we,78.39,4.74,83.13,fear
should try to see that they prevent they,80.34,4.23,84.57000000000001,sad
do not develop diabetes and we can,83.13,5.16,88.28999999999999,sad
prevent diabetes in this situation we,84.57,6.39,90.96,sad
can also use the hba1c level to diagnose,88.29,4.289,92.57900000000001,sad
diabetes and anybody who has a blood,90.96,3.96,94.91999999999999,sad
sugar level of me on sea level of more,92.579,5.131,97.71,sad
than 6.5 can be said to have diabetes,94.92,5.67,100.59,NA
now another important thing is that we,97.71,5.22,102.92999999999999,NA
should always do these tests on more,100.59,3.93,104.52000000000001,NA
than one occasion we can't just rely on,102.93,3.99,106.92,NA
one test and say that a person has got,104.52,4.11,108.63,NA
diabetes we should do it more than once,106.92,4.019,110.93900000000001,NA
and then see whether the consistently it,108.63,4.18,112.81,NA
is in that range,110.939,6.42,117.359,NA
