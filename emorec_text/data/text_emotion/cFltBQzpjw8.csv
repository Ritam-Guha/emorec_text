hi i'm cherylin from Duke Clinical Research Institute and shanghaiing hospital I would like to tell you our study about the use of beta blocker statin and diuretic increase the risk of,0.0,30.799,30.799,sad
new-onset diabetes in patient with itt it's a real analysis of data from navigator trial the study question is what is the risk of new-onset diabetes when using beta blocker diuretic and,14.429,33.011,47.440000000000005,sad
Staten impatient with igt and any other cardiovascular risk factors the summer answer is a mount patient with itt and cardiovascular risk factors by using cereals glucose measurement the use of,31.08,32.64,63.72,NA
diuretic and Staten are associated with increased risk of diabetes where is the effect a beta blocker is nonsignificant many recent study have showed that long-term use of diuretic beta blocker,48.39,27.45,75.84,NA

ritual of 1.32 for statin where is the effect of beta blocker is now significant we have robust data for our study and there are some limitations first is a post-hoc study from navigator,223.17,29.009999999999998,252.17999999999998,happy
trial which is not powered to examine such association at the first place second we did not examine the dose response for those medication and progression to diabetes third we have,238.89,29.07,267.96,sad
limited population in beta blocker group which is underpowered to examine such association among those populations and family we did not examine the cardiovascular outcomes,253.2,26.28,279.48,sad
using those medication among i gt patient the strength of our study is that first it's a largest study of this kind to date and we use a standard method to diagnose diabetes by using,266.25,28.83,295.08,sad
