hi i'm cherylin from Duke Clinical,0.0,5.04,5.04,happy
Research Institute and shanghaiing,2.61,5.249,7.859,happy
hospital I would like to tell you our,5.04,5.269,10.309000000000001,happy
study about the use of beta blocker,7.859,6.57,14.429,happy
statin and diuretic increase the risk of,10.309,8.671,18.979999999999997,happy
new-onset diabetes in patient with itt,14.429,7.381,21.810000000000002,happy
it's a real analysis of data from,18.98,5.41,24.39,happy
navigator trial the study question is,21.81,5.69,27.5,happy
what is the risk of new-onset diabetes,24.39,6.69,31.080000000000002,happy
when using beta blocker diuretic and,27.5,7.84,35.34,happy
Staten impatient with igt and any other,31.08,6.69,37.769999999999996,happy
cardiovascular risk factors the summer,35.34,6.39,41.730000000000004,happy
answer is a mount patient with itt and,37.77,7.26,45.03,
cardiovascular risk factors by using,41.73,6.66,48.39,
cereals glucose measurement the use of,45.03,5.64,50.67,
diuretic and Staten are associated with,48.39,5.28,53.67,
increased risk of diabetes where is the,50.67,5.659,56.329,
effect a beta blocker is nonsignificant,53.67,5.43,59.1,
many recent study have showed that,56.329,5.351,61.68,
long-term use of diuretic beta blocker,59.1,5.73,64.83,happy
and Staten increase the fasting glucose,61.68,6.06,67.74,happy
level and those concerns have led us fda,64.83,5.93,70.75999999999999,happy
to initiate a statin label change in,67.74,7.199,74.939,happy
2012 however limited study has examined,70.76,7.33,78.09,happy
Association among patient with igt and,74.939,6.601,81.53999999999999,happy
cardiovascular risk factors therefore we,78.09,5.91,84.0,happy
initiate our study by using data from,81.54,4.829,86.369,happy
navigator troll navigator trial is a,84.0,4.2,88.2,fear
multinational randomness trowel,86.369,4.86,91.229,happy

into this travel from january 2002 and,100.95,7.709,108.659,fear
2004 patron road have a duty and space,104.24,6.879,111.119,happy
line and those patient who have diabetes,108.659,5.581,114.24000000000001,happy
are excluded therefore we examine the,111.119,5.161,116.28,
initiation of treatment among patients,114.24,5.85,120.08999999999999,
who are treatment-naive at pace line for,116.28,6.119,122.399,
the following four subgroups beta,120.09,5.94,126.03,

channel blocker which serves as a,126.03,5.16,131.19,

his five years and point of ours,131.19,7.1,138.29,happy
are defined as new onset diabetes,133.86,7.38,141.24,happy
specifically as falling defined the,138.29,5.41,143.7,happy
frequency of measurement is every six,141.24,4.02,145.26000000000002,
months for the first two three years,143.7,4.98,148.67999999999998,happy
then annually afterward we examine the,145.26,6.69,151.95,happy
initiation of treatment a progression to,148.68,6.9,155.58,happy
diabetes along the whole full of time we,151.95,6.18,158.13,happy
use marginal structure model which,155.58,5.52,161.10000000000002,
enable us to take into account time,158.13,5.37,163.5,
dependent variables and those time,161.1,5.34,166.44,
changing variables depend on which to,163.5,6.209,169.709,
initiate stop and subsequent changes of,166.44,5.64,172.07999999999998,
medications marginal structure model,169.709,5.041,174.75,happy
simply put is a cox proportional model,172.08,5.01,177.09,happy
adjusting for time changing variables,174.75,4.77,179.52,
along the study population sixteen,177.09,4.61,181.70000000000002,
percent a beta-blocker and live patient,179.52,4.469,183.989,
initiate beta blocker treatment during,181.7,5.02,186.72,
follow-up twenty percent of the erratic,183.989,6.061,190.05,
naive patient initiates diuretic during,186.72,7.65,194.37,

percent for calcium channel blocker from,194.37,6.089,200.459,
the baseline we can see that patient who,197.31,5.82,203.13,
initiate treatment has the same fasting,200.459,6.421,206.88,
glucose level and hba1c level compared,203.13,6.45,209.57999999999998,
with loss patient who never initiate any,206.88,4.77,211.65,
treatment during follow-up the result,209.58,5.82,215.4,happy
our study show that the use of diuretic,211.65,5.73,217.38,happy
instead and increase the risk of,215.4,4.77,220.17000000000002,happy
diabetes with the hazard ratio of one,217.38,5.79,223.17,happy
point two three four diuretic and has,220.17,7.41,227.57999999999998,happy
ritual of 1.32 for statin where is the,223.17,6.36,229.53,happy
effect of beta blocker is now,227.58,5.1,232.68,happy
significant we have robust data for our,229.53,6.019,235.549,happy
study and there are some limitations,232.68,6.21,238.89000000000001,happy
first is a post-hoc study from navigator,235.549,5.321,240.87,happy
trial which is not powered to examine,238.89,5.03,243.92,happy
such association at the first place,240.87,6.36,247.23000000000002,happy
second we did not examine the dose,243.92,5.319,249.23899999999998,happy
response for those medication and,247.23,5.97,253.2,happy
progression to diabetes third we have,249.239,6.391,255.63,happy
limited population in beta blocker group,253.2,5.31,258.51,happy
which is underpowered to examine such,255.63,5.75,261.38,happy
association among those populations and,258.51,5.73,264.24,happy
family we did not examine the,261.38,4.87,266.25,happy
cardiovascular outcomes,264.24,4.62,268.86,happy
using those medication among i gt,266.25,5.49,271.74,happy
patient the strength of our study is,268.86,6.09,274.95,happy
that first it's a largest study of this,271.74,6.0,277.74,happy
kind to date and we use a standard,274.95,5.52,280.46999999999997,happy
method to diagnose diabetes by using,277.74,5.73,283.47,happy
serious glucose measurement the marginal,280.47,5.45,285.92,neutral
structure model enable or pursued Oh,283.47,4.83,288.3,happy
randomization study design in,285.92,4.99,290.91,happy
treatment-naive patient the,288.3,5.78,294.08,happy
generalization of our study result are,290.91,6.81,297.72,happy
specifically to patient with itt and,294.08,6.85,300.93,
cardiovascular risk factors to conclude,297.72,7.44,305.16,happy
in high-risk patient with itt their use,300.93,6.54,307.47,happy
of diuretic and Staten are associated,305.16,4.82,309.98,happy
with the increased risk of diabetes,307.47,5.75,313.22,happy
where is the effect of beta blocker is,309.98,5.89,315.87,happy
non-significant from a clinical,313.22,6.88,320.1,happy
perspective among patient with itt and,315.87,7.01,322.88,happy
cardiovascular risk factor a baseline,320.1,5.069,325.16900000000004,happy
civilians of glucose level should be,322.88,4.93,327.81,happy
considered further study are orientated,325.169,4.981,330.15,happy
to examining the cardiovascular outcomes,327.81,5.73,333.54,happy
of using those medication among itt,330.15,6.15,336.29999999999995,happy
patient we gratefully appreciate this,333.54,5.58,339.12,happy
