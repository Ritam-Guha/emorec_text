"I had another question I wanted to answer
it with a quick video they were talking",0.06,5.009,5.069,
"about having hypoglycemia low blood
sugar and every time they consume",5.069,5.461,10.530000000000001,
"protein they feel a lot better okay so
they wanted to know why protein helps",10.53,5.22,15.75,
"with hypoglycemia now when I had low
blood sugar issues and by the way what",15.75,6.27,22.02,
"happens is when the blood sugar comes up
insulin will then push the blood sugar",22.02,4.65,26.67,
"down and you can end up with lower blood
sugar and people with low blood sugar a",26.67,4.8,31.470000000000002,
"lot of times have a higher amount of
insulin in their body and it's pushing",31.47,4.769,36.239,
"it down and we don't have those counter
hormones or counter regulatory hormones",36.239,5.101,41.339999999999996,
"to kind of push it back up so you end up
with low blood sugar and the symptoms",41.34,3.6,44.940000000000005,

I remember having hypoglycemia really",53.55,3.63,57.18,
"bad and I'd really dry irritated eyes
then I started consuming protein and I",57.18,5.519,62.699,
"felt great for years but getting back to
the video some people have this idea",62.699,5.341,68.03999999999999,
"that the fuel that the body uses is
either glucose sugar or fat or ketones",68.04,8.21,76.25,
"but protein can be used as a fuel
protein can be broken down in the body",76.25,8.61,84.86,
"into what's called carbon skeletons and
that can actually be converted into",84.86,8.71,93.57,
"glucose okay and the term is
gluconeogenesis so your body can make",93.57,5.97,99.53999999999999,
"fuel glucose from protein so protein can
act as a fuel in addition to replacing",99.54,6.24,105.78,
"your protein in your body so it's not
just fat and glucose you can get energy",105.78,6.57,112.35,
"from protein and this is why when you
consume protein when you have low blood",112.35,4.26,116.61,
"sugar you actually start feeling better
now if you were to consume a",116.61,3.48,120.09,
"carbohydrate when you had hypoglycemia
you would feel better for maybe a minute",120.09,5.76,125.85000000000001,
"or two but then the insulin is gonna
kick it back down here now what's unique",125.85,5.01,130.85999999999999,
"about consuming protein is that
yes you are gonna stimulate some insulin",130.86,6.15,137.01000000000002,
"especially if you're consuming a lot of
protein but you're also going to",137.01,3.63,140.64,
"stimulate at the same time
glucagon glucagon is the opposing",140.64,5.84,146.48,
"hormone to insulin it's made by the
pancreas as well and glucagon will raise",146.48,5.83,152.31,
"the blood sugar and insulin will lower
it so it'll create a nice leveling",152.31,5.22,157.53,
"effect right here when you consume
protein so protein is a glucogenic",157.53,5.25,162.78,
"precursor so it's actually a building
block that can be turned into glucose if",162.78,5.85,168.63,
"your body needs to do that now this
video is not just to have people start",168.63,5.01,173.64,

gonna feel better if you consume protein",178.44,4.41,182.85,

solution for hypoglycemia is to get on a",182.85,5.639,188.489,
"healthy ketogenic diet do the whole
program and intermittent fasting because",188.489,4.53,193.019,
"that way you will correct this large
amount of insulin that is really behind",193.019,5.911,198.93,
"this problem the first place and that's
coming from insulin resistance and once",198.93,5.91,204.84,
"this is corrected you won't have the
highs and lows anymore so the need to",204.84,4.5,209.34,
"fix anything related to hypoglycemia is
not there anymore so your blood Sugar's",209.34,5.04,214.38,
