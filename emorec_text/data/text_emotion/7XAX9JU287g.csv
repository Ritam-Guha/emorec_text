well before i came to sequoia health i,0.96,5.439,6.399,NA
was struggling with neuropathy i've been,3.76,6.32,10.08,NA
a diabetic since uh 2002.,6.399,6.561,12.96,NA
neuropathy kind of just snuck up on me,10.08,4.559,14.639,NA
over the years one of those things it,12.96,4.239,17.199,NA
doesn't go away and it kind of only gets,14.639,5.361,20.0,NA
worse but i came here and admittedly,17.199,4.881,22.080000000000002,NA
it's different than traditional medicine,20.0,4.88,24.88,NA
where you go in and get a pill,22.08,4.64,26.72,NA
i remember walking back out to my car,24.88,4.319,29.198999999999998,NA
after my first treatment and i could,26.72,5.6,32.32,NA
actually feel the ground under my feet,29.199,5.2,34.399,NA
and i don't think i had experienced that,32.32,3.84,36.16,NA
for years,34.399,3.201,37.6,NA
i didn't even know i was missing it,36.16,4.559,40.718999999999994,NA
because i i was just gone for so long,37.6,5.44,43.04,NA
and i could feel the ground under my,40.719,6.16,46.879000000000005,NA
feet and i thought wow that is great,43.04,6.48,49.519999999999996,NA
and it's only improved since then,46.879,5.281,52.16,NA
well after my treatment at sequoia i,49.52,5.359,54.879000000000005,NA
feel like a normal human being i feel,52.16,5.2,57.36,NA
like the person i used to be i'd,54.879,4.48,59.358999999999995,NA
recommend if anybody is thinking about,57.36,5.039,62.399,NA
this just to come in keep an open mind,59.359,4.401,63.760000000000005,NA
just relax,62.399,3.76,66.159,NA
and accept the treatment and you're,63.76,5.8,69.56,NA
going to feel better,66.159,3.401,69.56,NA
