gastroparesis is a condition that,17.88,5.319,23.198999999999998,
affects the normal spontaneous movements,20.32,5.68,26.0,
of the muscles also known as motility,23.199,4.4,27.599000000000004,

ordinarily strong muscular contractions,27.599,5.681,33.28,
propel food through your digestive tract,30.16,5.68,35.84,

slow gastric emptying and cause very,62.719,6.08,68.799,fear
similar symptoms for people who already,65.76,5.44,71.2,fear
