"(upbeat music) - Hey everyone, this is
The 10's Beginner Workout. Basically, over the course of
the last four or five months I've had a lot of people ask
me for a beginners workout. Basically a plan for someone",0.372,9.959,10.331,NA
"who's never started working out, doesn't have a gym,
doesn't even have weights, so just body weight stuff. And this is great for people who either just wanna start
seeing their muscles increase,",16.255,7.854,24.108999999999998,neutral
"you know start getting like a
little bit of some definition so you can get excited to go into the gym or for people who need to lose some fat cause you could do this as a cardio thing and lose a lot of fat",24.109,9.015,33.124,NA
"over the course of a couple
months doing this consistently. So, I'm going to take you into
the first exercise right now. So the first exercise that we're gonna start with is pushups. Now, if you have the ability to",33.124,8.795,41.919000000000004,NA
"you're gonna do full-form pushups. But if you don't have the ability to push yourself up 10 times then you're just going
to do it from your knees. So instead of from your toes",41.919,6.96,48.879,NA
"you're doing it from your knees. So it's 10 pushups. All the way down. Make sure that you're
contracting your chest. You're feeling your triceps engaged.",48.879,6.973,55.852,NA
"I like to keep my elbows flared
in, not flared in, tucked in instead of keeping them
flared out like this. About 10. I think that was eleven,
but we're about 10. Then we're moving on to the next exercise.",55.852,11.325999999999999,67.178,NA
"So the second exercise
we're going to do is really actually to get
your heart rate going and it's going to be burpees. You know what these are, but
I'll show you them anyways. Basically start standing, come
down, push your legs back,",67.178,9.375,76.553,NA
"and come back up. And because this is a 10's workout of course we're doing ten of these. (upbeat music) Woohoo, now we're going
on to the third exercise.",76.553,10.344000000000001,86.89699999999999,NA
"Alright, so now we're
doing a third exercise and this third exercise
is going to be focusing on your leg muscles instead of cardio. So what we are going to
do is alternating lunges. Each time you come up
on both sides is one.",89.299,10.456,99.75500000000001,NA
"So you need to do ten of those. When you do these you
wanna to extend your foot as far as you can forward
and comfortably land on it. Not hard like I just did. Land with your heel, come down,",100.973,8.15,109.123,NA
"push through your knee through your heel as you come back up and push back. This should be sort of,
you should feel your quads, your hamstrings and your glutes engaged because you're pushing yourself back",109.123,10.762,119.885,NA
"instead of when you're doing
a walking lunge forward. So 10 of these. (upbeat music) And now we move on to the last
exercise of the 10's workout. Alright, so as you can see I'm already",119.885,10.396,130.281,NA
"starting to sweat a little bit (buzz) so this is pretty hard cardio for anyone, especially if you have
a little extra weight to throw around.",133.044,5.7379999999999995,138.782,neutral
"And, you like my model pose? This last exercise is
going to be for your abs. It's kinda a crunch but
it's like my own style. So this is what we are going to do. 10 of these of course.",138.782,8.478,147.26000000000002,neutral
"Lay down flat. You're going to bring your knees up as you bring your torso up. So it's just like this. Your hands are extended
straight to keep your balance.",147.26,6.419,153.679,neutral
"Just like that. All the way up. All the way down. Keeping your shoulder
blades off of the ground, and your heels off the ground",153.679,7.2509999999999994,160.93,neutral
"so that you're abs are constantly engaged. We're going to do ten of these. (upbeat music) Whew, okay, so I'm pretty
sweaty, I'm pretty worked up. My heart beat's going pretty fast.",160.93,10.054,170.984,NA
"This is a great exercise really for anyone that's starting out,
really needs to get a base, just start doing something. This is great because you can recycle this and you can do this as much as you want.",170.984,9.200000000000001,180.184,neutral
"Also, if you're ever on the
road and you can't do anything, you know you don't have
a gym that you can go to, you can definitely do this. Just to do a little bit of
something, some maintenance work. So you just saw the four
exercises that we did",180.184,8.835999999999999,189.01999999999998,neutral
"for 10 reps each. Once you've done each of those one time that is one interval. Basically, if you're just starting, you haven't done anything in
your life do one interval.",189.02,8.237,197.257,NA
"But you know, kinda judge
how you feel you can handle, and then every time you
work out with this try to, try to do another interval
if you think you can. If you think you can handle
it do another interval, and work your way up until
you can do this you know",197.257,11.024000000000001,208.281,NA
"15 times no problem, because by that point you
could walk into a gym, and you know you could handle things. You'd have a little bit of musculature. You'd know a little bit
more about your body.",208.281,8.405000000000001,216.686,neutral
"Plus, if you're someone
who is a little bit obese this is a great way to lose fat, kinda get some confidence in yourself, realize what you're doing, realize how to exercise and
then you can come to a gym,",216.686,8.783999999999999,225.47,sad
"and just be completely comfortable. So there you go guys! You all asked me to
make a beginner workout. I know there are a lot

kinda segue you guys into that. And if you have any
