But if you don't have the ability,43.765,1.114,44.879,NA
to push yourself up 10 times,44.879,1.283,46.162,NA
"then you're just going
to do it from your knees.",46.162,1.504,47.666,happy

do is alternating lunges.",94.558,1.614,96.17200000000001,NA
"Each time you come up
on both sides is one.",96.172,3.583,99.755,NA
