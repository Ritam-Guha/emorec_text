hey guys today we're gonna talk about,0.03,5.249,5.279,happy
hypoglycemia should you increase or,1.38,6.9,8.280000000000001,happy
should you decrease your carbohydrates,5.279,4.501,9.780000000000001,happy
alright what are the symptoms of,8.28,6.08,14.36,happy
hypoglycemia shakiness nervousness dizzy,9.78,9.06,18.84,happy
hungry cravings and your irritable other,14.36,6.1,20.46,happy
than that you're perfectly fine now what,18.84,3.63,22.47,happy
you need to know about hypoglycemia is,20.46,5.25,25.71,happy
this it's the high insulin that's,22.47,6.149,28.619,happy
lowering the blood sugar yes it's true,25.71,4.95,30.66,happy
that your adrenals or your liver might,28.619,5.1,33.719,happy
be weak and it goes back down but it is,30.66,5.309,35.969,happy
the high levels of insulin that is,33.719,4.86,38.579,happy
pushing the blood sugar down because the,35.969,5.281,41.25,happy
purpose of insulin is to lower blood,38.579,5.701,44.28,happy
sugar when the insulin is high it lowers,41.25,5.899,47.149,happy
the blood sugar when the insulin is low,44.28,5.549,49.829,happy
and will your blood sugar will go higher,47.149,4.84,51.989000000000004,happy
okay it goes out of control so in,49.829,5.521,55.35,happy
diabetes type 1 where you don't make any,51.989,5.191,57.18,happy
insulin you're gonna have high blood,55.35,3.9,59.25,sad
sugar and this is why persons put on,57.18,4.98,62.16,happy
medication usually insulin now over here,59.25,5.129,64.379,happy
type 2 it's a little different you,62.16,4.74,66.89999999999999,happy
actually have high levels of insulin and,64.379,4.591,68.97,happy
type 2 but because you have insulin,66.9,5.34,72.24000000000001,happy
resistance it makes it appear like you,68.97,6.0,74.97,happy
have a low insulin okay inside the cell,72.24,4.8,77.03999999999999,happy
so it's basically of all this insulin,74.97,3.899,78.869,sad
but it's not working alright so now,77.04,3.45,80.49000000000001,neutral
let's talk about the recommendations,78.869,4.651,83.52,happy
that you normally get from the medical,80.49,5.64,86.13,happy
community which I believe is very very,83.52,5.43,88.94999999999999,happy
bad advice so you get this,86.13,5.07,91.19999999999999,happy
recommendation to increase your protein,88.95,6.0,94.95,happy
okay what they don't emphasize is to,91.2,6.45,97.65,happy
lower the carbohydrates and they,94.95,4.739,99.68900000000001,happy
definitely don't emphasize to increase,97.65,4.89,102.54,happy
the fat now take a look at this the real,99.689,6.151,105.83999999999999,happy
root cause of hypoglycemia is high,102.54,6.869,109.409,happy
insulin adding more carbs is going to,105.84,5.4,111.24000000000001,happy
increase insulin we don't want to do,109.409,5.011,114.42,happy
that adding more protein will increase,111.24,7.14,118.38,happy
some insulin okay adding more fat is the,114.42,5.4,119.82000000000001,happy
only thing that's not going to increase,118.38,3.66,122.03999999999999,NA
the insulin now it's okay to consume,119.82,5.28,125.1,NA
protein but only if you are on a,122.04,6.48,128.52,happy
low-carb diet because when you increase,125.1,7.859,132.959,happy
protein with carbs you more than double,128.52,5.299,133.81900000000002,happy
the in,132.959,2.931,135.89000000000001,NA
response you also get this condition,133.819,3.631,137.45,happy
called glycation where you're actually,135.89,3.989,139.879,happy
combining a protein with a sugar,137.45,4.439,141.88899999999998,happy
molecule okay and that's really bad in,139.879,3.87,143.749,happy
the body and what's even worse than that,141.889,4.141,146.03,happy
is they're also recommending the six,143.749,4.71,148.459,happy
meals a day to eat very frequently to,146.03,4.739,150.769,happy
prevent the drop in blood sugar and all,148.459,3.81,152.269,NA
that will do is just continue the,150.769,2.731,153.5,NA
problem so you'll never be able to,152.269,3.36,155.62900000000002,happy
correct it so here's what you should do,153.5,2.879,156.379,happy
okay,155.629,3.03,158.659,happy
realize that it's the high insulin,156.379,5.131,161.51,happy
causing the problem and by the way it's,158.659,5.851,164.51,happy
totally okay to consume protein just go,161.51,4.83,166.34,happy
with lower carbs okay,164.51,4.649,169.159,happy
increase your fat fat is going to help,166.34,5.97,172.31,happy
you go longer without getting hungry fat,169.159,5.31,174.469,happy
will help stabilize the blood sugars fat,172.31,3.799,176.109,happy
is not going to worsen the situation,174.469,4.531,179.0,happy
okay so we want to do a little more,176.109,4.99,181.09900000000002,happy
protein a little more fat you can do,179.0,5.01,184.01,happy
vegetable carbohydrates but keep all the,181.099,5.28,186.379,happy
other carbohydrates low and watch all,184.01,4.259,188.269,happy
the improvements that will occur with,186.379,4.771,191.14999999999998,happy
