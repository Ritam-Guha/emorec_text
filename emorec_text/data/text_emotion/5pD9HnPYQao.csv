hey guys today we're gonna talk about hypoglycemia should you increase or should you decrease your carbohydrates alright what are the symptoms of hypoglycemia shakiness nervousness dizzy,0.03,31.790000000000006,31.820000000000007,angry
hungry cravings and your irritable other than that you're perfectly fine now what you need to know about hypoglycemia is this it's the high insulin that's lowering the blood sugar yes it's true,14.36,26.079,40.439,angry
that your adrenals or your liver might be weak and it goes back down but it is the high levels of insulin that is pushing the blood sugar down because the purpose of insulin is to lower blood,28.619,26.250999999999998,54.87,angry
sugar when the insulin is high it lowers the blood sugar when the insulin is low and will your blood sugar will go higher okay it goes out of control so in diabetes type 1 where you don't make any,41.25,27.0,68.25,angry
insulin you're gonna have high blood sugar and this is why persons put on medication usually insulin now over here type 2 it's a little different you actually have high levels of insulin and,55.35,23.340000000000003,78.69,angry
type 2 but because you have insulin resistance it makes it appear like you have a low insulin okay inside the cell so it's basically of all this insulin but it's not working alright so now,66.9,23.489,90.38900000000001,angry
let's talk about the recommendations that you normally get from the medical community which I believe is very very bad advice so you get this recommendation to increase your protein,78.869,26.791,105.66,angry
okay what they don't emphasize is to lower the carbohydrates and they definitely don't emphasize to increase the fat now take a look at this the real root cause of hypoglycemia is high,91.2,29.099,120.299,angry
insulin adding more carbs is going to increase insulin we don't want to do that adding more protein will increase some insulin okay adding more fat is the only thing that's not going to increase,105.84,26.611,132.451,angry
the insulin now it's okay to consume protein but only if you are on a low-carb diet because when you increase protein with carbs you more than double the in,119.82,27.849,147.66899999999998,angry
response you also get this condition called glycation where you're actually combining a protein with a sugar molecule okay and that's really bad in the body and what's even worse than that,133.819,20.07,153.88899999999998,angry
is they're also recommending the six meals a day to eat very frequently to prevent the drop in blood sugar and all that will do is just continue the problem so you'll never be able to,143.749,19.35,163.099,angry
correct it so here's what you should do okay realize that it's the high insulin causing the problem and by the way it's totally okay to consume protein just go,153.5,21.720999999999997,175.221,angry
with lower carbs okay increase your fat fat is going to help you go longer without getting hungry fat will help stabilize the blood sugars fat is not going to worsen the situation,164.51,24.258999999999997,188.76899999999998,angry
okay so we want to do a little more protein a little more fat you can do vegetable carbohydrates but keep all the other carbohydrates low and watch all the improvements that will occur with,176.109,24.310000000000002,200.419,angry
