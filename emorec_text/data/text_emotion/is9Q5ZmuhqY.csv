hello this is dr. Ford Brewer with state-of-the-art preventive medicine available to all at least all with access to YouTube today we're going to talk about insulin resistance or,0.03,25.75,25.78,neutral
pre-diabetes and the oral medications for diabetes and pre-diabetes the two most popular are metformin and pioglitazone most consider pilot ism running a very poor second they consider,12.57,38.61,51.18,neutral
pioglitazone being a very difficult drug to take we'll go over some of that in the in the video first of all though let's understand quickly what a cochrane study is cochran CEO CHR II and II look,30.96,31.759,62.719,neutral
"that up on Wikipedia in fact you'll find that the Cochran organization does have a partnership with Wikipedia and there are over 300,000 cochrane participants what they do is look at a meta-analysis",47.73,38.589999999999996,86.32,neutral
a meta-analysis is an attempt to put different studies on a similar topic together so and it's almost like a review of the literature on an exhibit on an existing item so let's let's talk,66.299,36.120999999999995,102.42,neutral
about the Cochran studies in this area in 2010 there was a there was a cochrane study that showed something very important about metformin risk metformin was first discovered in the 1920s it was,85.65,33.748000000000005,119.39800000000001,neutral
available in the UK in 1960s it was not made available in the u.s. until the 1990s midnight in fact 1995 part of the reason for that was a fear associated with lactic acidosis well in in 2010 the,101.579,40.652,142.231,neutral
Cochrane reviews indicated that when you actually study metformin there was no danger of lactic acidosis it was associated with that class of drugs that class is called biguanide,123.0,30.649,153.649,neutral
and other members of the biguanide drug class did have lactic acidosis but not metformin metformin has become the frontline recommendation from organizations like the American College,137.049,36.449999999999996,173.499,NA
of endocrinology the WHI World Health Organization did a lit review looking at metformin and found it to be superior in terms of cardiovascular outcomes impact on cholesterol and triglycerides and,154.329,35.399,189.728,NA
safety and side effects so what what have we seen on the side of pioglitazone and the other day I was in Diane's pioglitazone tends to have better results in terms of decreased,172.269,29.689999999999998,201.959,NA
cardiovascular events and mortality this is probably due to a positive impact on cardiovascular inflammation that is the finding of a recent cochrane study so why would there be so little use of,188.579,35.94200000000001,224.52100000000002,NA
Toyota's own and so much you submit Foreman if the studies actually show improved outcomes well here's why there's also increased side effects specifically edema that edema can even,206.79,26.348999999999997,233.13899999999998,NA
lead to heart failure in certain patients so again it's like the situation with ACE inhibitors versus ARBs ACE inhibitors do have improved outcomes it's probably due to decreased,219.819,32.009,251.82799999999997,NA
a cardiovascular inflammation but they also have some negative impact and safety issues compared to arcs same thing here piyo does have improved outcomes and decreased cardiovascular,235.449,36.690000000000005,272.139,NA
events however there is increased safety concerns due to edema it's like rosanna rosanna Dennis said for the of us who remember it's still always,253.479,27.732,281.211,NA
something thank you again,267.47,4.1,271.57000000000005,NA
