hello this is dr. Ford Brewer with,0.03,5.749,5.779,neutral
state-of-the-art preventive medicine,2.87,5.29,8.16,neutral
available to all at least all with,5.779,5.021,10.8,neutral
access to YouTube today we're going to,8.16,4.41,12.57,happy
talk about insulin resistance or,10.8,5.28,16.080000000000002,happy
pre-diabetes and the oral medications,12.57,7.619,20.189,happy
for diabetes and pre-diabetes the two,16.08,6.51,22.589999999999996,neutral
most popular are metformin and,20.189,7.58,27.769,neutral
pioglitazone most consider pilot ism,22.59,8.37,30.96,neutral
running a very poor second they consider,27.769,8.531,36.3,neutral
pioglitazone being a very difficult drug,30.96,7.41,38.370000000000005,neutral
to take we'll go over some of that in,36.3,4.68,40.98,neutral
the in the video first of all though,38.37,4.74,43.11,fear
let's understand quickly what a cochrane,40.98,6.75,47.73,fear
study is cochran CEO CHR II and II look,43.11,8.179,51.289,fear
that up on Wikipedia in fact you'll find,47.73,6.54,54.269999999999996,neutral
that the Cochran organization does have,51.289,7.781,59.07,neutral
a partnership with Wikipedia and there,54.27,8.39,62.660000000000004,neutral
"are over 300,000 cochrane participants",59.07,7.229,66.299,neutral
what they do is look at a meta-analysis,62.66,8.65,71.31,neutral
a meta-analysis is an attempt to put,66.299,6.901,73.2,neutral
different studies on a similar topic,71.31,6.66,77.97,neutral
together so and it's almost like a,73.2,7.26,80.46000000000001,neutral
review of the literature on an exhibit,77.97,7.68,85.65,neutral
on an existing item so let's let's talk,80.46,7.62,88.08,neutral
about the Cochran studies in this area,85.65,4.859,90.509,neutral
in 2010 there was a there was a cochrane,88.08,4.2,92.28,neutral
study that showed something very,90.509,6.271,96.78,neutral
important about metformin risk metformin,92.28,9.299,101.57900000000001,neutral
was first discovered in the 1920s it was,96.78,9.119,105.899,neutral
available in the UK in 1960s it was not,101.579,7.131,108.71,neutral
made available in the u.s. until the,105.899,7.29,113.18900000000001,neutral
1990s midnight in fact 1995 part of the,108.71,6.61,115.32,neutral
reason for that was a fear associated,113.189,9.811,123.0,neutral
with lactic acidosis well in in 2010 the,115.32,9.81,125.13,neutral
Cochrane reviews indicated that when you,123.0,5.879,128.879,neutral
actually study metformin there was no,125.13,6.76,131.89,neutral
danger of lactic acidosis,128.879,5.53,134.409,neutral
it was associated with that class of,131.89,5.159,137.04899999999998,neutral
drugs that class is called biguanide,134.409,7.321,141.73,fear
and other members of the biguanide drug,137.049,7.8,144.84900000000002,NA
class did have lactic acidosis but not,141.73,7.679,149.409,NA
metformin metformin has become the,144.849,7.56,152.409,NA
frontline recommendation from,149.409,4.92,154.32899999999998,NA
organizations like the American College,152.409,8.491,160.89999999999998,NA
of endocrinology the WHI World Health,154.329,8.761,163.09,NA
Organization did a lit review looking at,160.9,4.709,165.609,NA
metformin and found it to be superior in,163.09,7.079,170.169,NA
terms of cardiovascular outcomes impact,165.609,6.66,172.269,NA
on cholesterol and triglycerides and,170.169,8.19,178.359,NA
safety and side effects so what what,172.269,8.58,180.84900000000002,NA
have we seen on the side of pioglitazone,178.359,6.38,184.739,NA
and the other day I was in Diane's,180.849,6.211,187.06,NA
pioglitazone tends to have better,184.739,3.84,188.579,NA
results in terms of decreased,187.06,4.679,191.739,NA
cardiovascular events and mortality this,188.579,5.681,194.26000000000002,NA
is probably due to a positive impact on,191.739,6.27,198.00900000000001,NA
cardiovascular inflammation that is the,194.26,6.8,201.06,NA
finding of a recent cochrane study so,198.009,8.781,206.79,NA
why would there be so little use of,201.06,8.41,209.47,NA
Toyota's own and so much you submit,206.79,5.199,211.989,NA
Foreman if the studies actually show,209.47,4.829,214.299,NA
improved outcomes well here's why,211.989,4.59,216.579,NA
there's also increased side effects,214.299,5.52,219.81900000000002,NA
specifically edema that edema can even,216.579,6.211,222.79000000000002,NA
lead to heart failure in certain,219.819,7.28,227.099,NA
patients so again it's like the,222.79,7.08,229.87,NA
situation with ACE inhibitors versus,227.099,5.681,232.78,NA
ARBs ACE inhibitors do have improved,229.87,5.579,235.449,NA
outcomes it's probably due to decreased,232.78,6.389,239.169,NA
a cardiovascular inflammation but they,235.449,6.51,241.959,NA
also have some negative impact and,239.169,7.47,246.639,NA
safety issues compared to arcs same,241.959,6.9,248.859,NA
thing here piyo does have improved,246.639,6.84,253.479,NA
outcomes and decreased cardiovascular,248.859,8.97,257.829,NA
events however there is increased safety,253.479,7.881,261.36,NA
concerns due to edema,257.829,6.601,264.43,NA
it's like rosanna rosanna Dennis said,261.36,3.59,264.95,NA
for the,264.43,3.04,267.47,NA
of us who remember it's still always,264.95,6.62,271.57,NA
something thank you again,267.47,4.1,271.57000000000005,NA
