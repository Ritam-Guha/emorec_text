many people are concerned about the risk,4.97,4.81,9.78,NA
of diabetes and many people haven't,7.77,4.409,12.178999999999998,fear
already if you have type-2 diabetes,9.78,6.96,16.74,fear
though it can be a two-way street and to,12.179,7.731,19.91,fear
begin a diet change to reverse diabetes,16.74,6.93,23.669999999999998,fear
step one is to avoid animal products now,19.91,5.199,25.109,fear
you might be thinking wait a minute I,23.67,4.609,28.279000000000003,fear
thought I was supposed to avoid sugar or,25.109,6.66,31.769000000000002,fear
avoid bread or maybe rice,28.279,7.421,35.7,fear
well these carbohydrates do release,31.769,5.611,37.379999999999995,fear
glucose into the blood and that's why,35.7,4.289,39.989000000000004,fear
people thought okay that sugar must be,37.38,4.65,42.03,fear
the problem but it turns out that the,39.989,4.111,44.099999999999994,fear
real problem with diabetes is the,42.03,4.89,46.92,fear
build-up of fat inside the cells of the,44.1,5.49,49.59,fear
body when fat builds up in your muscle,46.92,5.4,52.32,fear
cells or in your liver cells the sugar,49.59,4.89,54.480000000000004,fear
can't get inside and that's the problem,52.32,4.44,56.76,fear
and so that's why step one is to avoid,54.48,4.349,58.82899999999999,fear
animal products because when we do,56.76,4.819,61.579,sad
there's no animal fat in the diet at all,58.829,5.4,64.229,sad
that helps the cells to clean out step,61.579,5.65,67.229,fear
two keep vegetable oils to a minimum if,64.229,4.89,69.119,fear
you're the kind of person who is making,67.229,3.721,70.95,fear
dinner and you take your bottle of oil,69.119,4.021,73.14,fear
and you go glug glug glug glug glug glug,70.95,4.59,75.54,fear
glug glug glug oil all over everything,73.14,5.31,78.45,fear
that fat gets into your cells too and,75.54,6.42,81.96000000000001,fear
that's a problem so step three is choose,78.45,7.739,86.18900000000001,sad
the healthiest foods so white bread okay,81.96,6.81,88.77,fear
but rye bread or pumpernickel much,86.189,3.031,89.22,fear
better,88.77,2.43,91.2,fear
the whole-grain breads are better white,89.22,5.16,94.38,fear
potatoes are okay but a sweet potato is,91.2,5.61,96.81,fear
much better if you're having a breakfast,94.38,4.919,99.29899999999999,fear
cereal made for children that's going to,96.81,4.32,101.13,fear
raise your blood sugar especially if the,99.299,4.53,103.82900000000001,fear
box of cereal has a toy inside you know,101.13,4.71,105.83999999999999,fear
what I'm talking about have a healthier,103.829,4.141,107.97,fear
kind of something like oatmeal porridge,105.84,4.65,110.49000000000001,fear
or bran syrup that's better for you,107.97,6.3,114.27,fear
instead of sugar have fruit apples and,110.49,6.03,116.52,fear
bananas and oranges and peaches these,114.27,4.32,118.59,sad
foods taste sweet but they're very,116.52,4.739,121.259,sad
gentle on your blood sugar so step one,118.59,4.889,123.479,neutral
get away from the animal product step,121.259,4.65,125.909,neutral
two keep the oil very low step three,123.479,4.941,128.42,fear
choose the healthiest sources of,125.909,6.151,132.06,fear
carbohydrate and over time your diabetes,128.42,6.22,134.64,fear
might start to improve no I have one,132.06,4.89,136.95,neutral
last thing though let your doctor know,134.64,4.23,138.86999999999998,neutral
that you're going to do this because,136.95,3.6,140.54999999999998,neutral
although these steps sound very simple,138.87,4.47,143.34,neutral
they can be very very powerful and if,140.55,4.11,144.66000000000003,NA
you're taking medicine for your diabetes,143.34,4.83,148.17000000000002,NA
your blood sugar can start to fall too,144.66,5.76,150.42,NA
low when you're on a very healthy diet,148.17,4.8,152.97,NA
so your doctor can reduce your medicine,150.42,4.56,154.98,NA
as the diet starts to bring your blood,152.97,4.56,157.53,NA
sugar down naturally and that's going to,154.98,4.05,159.03,NA
be the best part of the solution good,157.53,3.65,161.18,NA
luck,159.03,2.15,161.18,NA
