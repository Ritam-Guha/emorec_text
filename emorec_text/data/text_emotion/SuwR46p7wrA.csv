[Applause] [Music] many people are concerned about the risk of diabetes and many people haven't already if you have type-2 diabetes,2.27,23.359,25.629,angry
though it can be a two-way street and to begin a diet change to reverse diabetes step one is to avoid animal products now you might be thinking wait a minute I thought I was supposed to avoid sugar or,12.179,31.129,43.308,angry
avoid bread or maybe rice well these carbohydrates do release glucose into the blood and that's why people thought okay that sugar must be the problem but it turns out that the,28.279,26.081999999999997,54.361,angry
real problem with diabetes is the build-up of fat inside the cells of the body when fat builds up in your muscle cells or in your liver cells the sugar can't get inside and that's the problem,42.03,25.11,67.14,angry
and so that's why step one is to avoid animal products because when we do there's no animal fat in the diet at all that helps the cells to clean out step two keep vegetable oils to a minimum if,54.48,25.108,79.588,angry
you're the kind of person who is making dinner and you take your bottle of oil and you go glug glug glug glug glug glug glug glug glug oil all over everything that fat gets into your cells too and,67.229,24.061999999999998,91.291,angry
that's a problem so step three is choose the healthiest foods so white bread okay but rye bread or pumpernickel much better the whole-grain breads are better white,78.45,25.169999999999998,103.62,angry
potatoes are okay but a sweet potato is much better if you're having a breakfast cereal made for children that's going to raise your blood sugar especially if the box of cereal has a toy inside you know,91.2,24.089000000000002,115.289,angry
what I'm talking about have a healthier kind of something like oatmeal porridge or bran syrup that's better for you instead of sugar have fruit apples and bananas and oranges and peaches these,103.829,25.441000000000003,129.26999999999998,angry
foods taste sweet but they're very gentle on your blood sugar so step one get away from the animal product step two keep the oil very low step three choose the healthiest sources of,116.52,25.37,141.89,sad
carbohydrate and over time your diabetes might start to improve no I have one last thing though let your doctor know that you're going to do this because although these steps sound very simple,128.42,23.41,151.82999999999998,sad
they can be very very powerful and if you're taking medicine for your diabetes your blood sugar can start to fall too low when you're on a very healthy diet so your doctor can reduce your medicine,140.55,24.06,164.61,NA
as the diet starts to bring your blood sugar down naturally and that's going to be the best part of the solution good luck [Applause],152.97,18.63,171.6,NA
