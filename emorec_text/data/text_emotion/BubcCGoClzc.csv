when Alex was first diagnosed the pump,0.0,6.629,6.629,angry
was a popular way to go she utterly did,2.28,6.27,8.549999999999999,angry
not feel comfortable doing that she,6.629,4.201,10.829999999999998,angry
wanted to do injections I thought it was,8.55,4.11,12.66,surprise
important to follow her lead in all,10.83,4.62,15.45,surprise
things because it was helping her to,12.66,4.949,17.609,
become independent living with type 1,15.45,4.19,19.64,
diabetes,17.609,2.031,19.64,
so what ended up happening was she was,25.57,7.72,33.29,happy
using the injections pretty much every,29.9,5.61,35.51,happy
day and there was a lot of ups and downs,33.29,5.01,38.3,fear
there were a lot of things we couldn't,35.51,7.74,43.25,fear
figure out and it just became very clear,38.3,8.91,47.209999999999994,happy
that the management of the diabetes was,43.25,6.54,49.79,happy
going to be much better handled if she,47.21,6.24,53.45,happy
went on a pump and I think initially as,49.79,6.269,56.059,happy
a young woman she felt that having,53.45,5.94,59.39,happy
anything attached to her body was not,56.059,5.041,61.099999999999994,fear
something that she really wanted to do,59.39,4.83,64.22,happy
and I understood that she did the,61.1,5.73,66.83,happy
injections for about a year and then she,64.22,6.18,70.4,fear
went on the pump and it is remarkable,66.83,6.899,73.729,happy
the difference in how the pump is able,70.4,7.68,78.08000000000001,happy
to manage diabetes better than in our,73.729,8.311,82.03999999999999,happy
opinion in our experience injections,78.08,6.149,84.229,neutral
because it's a lot more work with the,82.04,5.82,87.86000000000001,happy
injections so we kind of took baby steps,84.229,6.871,91.1,happy
towards it but at the end of the day and,87.86,5.34,93.2,happy
the technology has changed greatly as,91.1,6.15,97.25,happy
well the pump is very tiny now and it,93.2,6.9,100.10000000000001,happy
just becomes normal to wear but in the,97.25,5.22,102.47,happy
beginning it can be a transition the,100.1,4.35,104.44999999999999,fear
second thing that was incredibly helpful,102.47,6.0,108.47,fear
was CGM which again alex refused to do,104.45,6.779,111.229,happy
for a while and she was finger pricking,108.47,6.539,115.009,happy
and that became somewhat untenable,111.229,7.2,118.429,happy
because you have to prick your finger so,115.009,5.67,120.679,happy
many times during the day and you know,118.429,4.14,122.569,happy
what sometimes you don't because you,120.679,3.811,124.49000000000001,happy
don't feel like doing it but with the,122.569,5.731,128.3,
CGM it's automatic and it gives you all,124.49,5.879,130.369,
the information and it feeds you,128.3,5.549,133.84900000000002,NA
everything so I would say in our,130.369,6.871,137.24,NA
experience that using the pump and the,133.849,4.851,138.7,NA
CGM technology,137.24,4.7,141.94,NA
was life-altering but what I would also,138.7,6.93,145.63,NA
say is that as a newly diagnosed family,141.94,6.6,148.54,NA
sometimes you need to go through what,145.63,5.76,151.39,NA
you need to go through in terms of the,148.54,5.19,153.73,NA
initial injections and that's okay,151.39,4.13,155.51999999999998,NA
that's okay,153.73,4.28,158.01,NA
[Music],155.52,4.549,160.06900000000002,NA
