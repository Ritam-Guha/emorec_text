when Alex was first diagnosed the pump,0.0,6.629,6.629,neutral
was a popular way to go she utterly did,2.28,6.27,8.549999999999999,neutral
not feel comfortable doing that she,6.629,4.201,10.829999999999998,neutral
wanted to do injections I thought it was,8.55,4.11,12.66,neutral
important to follow her lead in all,10.83,4.62,15.45,neutral
things because it was helping her to,12.66,4.949,17.609,neutral
become independent living with type 1,15.45,4.19,19.64,NA
diabetes,17.609,2.031,19.64,NA
so what ended up happening was she was,25.57,7.72,33.29,neutral
using the injections pretty much every,29.9,5.61,35.51,neutral
day and there was a lot of ups and downs,33.29,5.01,38.3,neutral
there were a lot of things we couldn't,35.51,7.74,43.25,neutral
figure out and it just became very clear,38.3,8.91,47.209999999999994,neutral
that the management of the diabetes was,43.25,6.54,49.79,neutral
going to be much better handled if she,47.21,6.24,53.45,neutral
went on a pump and I think initially as,49.79,6.269,56.059,neutral
a young woman she felt that having,53.45,5.94,59.39,neutral
anything attached to her body was not,56.059,5.041,61.099999999999994,neutral
something that she really wanted to do,59.39,4.83,64.22,neutral
and I understood that she did the,61.1,5.73,66.83,neutral
injections for about a year and then she,64.22,6.18,70.4,neutral
went on the pump and it is remarkable,66.83,6.899,73.729,NA
the difference in how the pump is able,70.4,7.68,78.08000000000001,neutral
to manage diabetes better than in our,73.729,8.311,82.03999999999999,neutral
opinion in our experience injections,78.08,6.149,84.229,neutral
because it's a lot more work with the,82.04,5.82,87.86000000000001,neutral
injections so we kind of took baby steps,84.229,6.871,91.1,neutral
towards it but at the end of the day and,87.86,5.34,93.2,neutral
the technology has changed greatly as,91.1,6.15,97.25,neutral
well the pump is very tiny now and it,93.2,6.9,100.10000000000001,neutral
just becomes normal to wear but in the,97.25,5.22,102.47,neutral
beginning it can be a transition the,100.1,4.35,104.44999999999999,neutral
second thing that was incredibly helpful,102.47,6.0,108.47,neutral
was CGM which again alex refused to do,104.45,6.779,111.229,neutral
for a while and she was finger pricking,108.47,6.539,115.009,neutral
and that became somewhat untenable,111.229,7.2,118.429,neutral
because you have to prick your finger so,115.009,5.67,120.679,neutral
many times during the day and you know,118.429,4.14,122.569,neutral
what sometimes you don't because you,120.679,3.811,124.49000000000001,neutral
don't feel like doing it but with the,122.569,5.731,128.3,neutral
CGM it's automatic and it gives you all,124.49,5.879,130.369,NA
the information and it feeds you,128.3,5.549,133.84900000000002,NA
everything so I would say in our,130.369,6.871,137.24,NA
experience that using the pump and the,133.849,4.851,138.7,NA
CGM technology,137.24,4.7,141.94,NA
was life-altering but what I would also,138.7,6.93,145.63,NA
say is that as a newly diagnosed family,141.94,6.6,148.54,NA
sometimes you need to go through what,145.63,5.76,151.39,NA
you need to go through in terms of the,148.54,5.19,153.73,NA
initial injections and that's okay,151.39,4.13,155.51999999999998,NA
that's okay,153.73,4.28,158.01,NA
[Music],155.52,4.549,160.06900000000002,NA
