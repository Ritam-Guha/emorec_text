[Music] in this lecture we're going to discuss inborn errors of metabolism and children this is a very complicated field there are experts who specialize in this alone,0.65,26.321,26.971,angry
we're going to try and shed some light in the complexity of this and give some examples of errors of metabolism and hopefully make it a little bit easier to understand so here is glucose this is,13.7,28.479999999999997,42.17999999999999,angry
the essential building block with which we use to create all the energy we need to run our bodies as you recall from bio biochemistry glucose will be stored in the liver as glycogen stored in glycogen,27.66,29.599,57.259,sad
patients can have problems with storage of glycogen this family of metabolic disorders our glycogen stores diseases we'll talk about those glucose is broken down into pyruvate through glycolysis,42.32,27.07,69.39,sad
and of course in the other direction we have gluconeogenesis it is important to understand that that breakdown can very rarely have some problems but that's pretty rare because you can imagine that,55.89,25.710000000000004,81.60000000000001,NA
if you're having a problem with glycolysis it's pretty hard to get by glucose also is sent over to something called the pentose phosphate shunt the pentose phosphate shunt is responsible,69.63,26.27,95.89999999999999,NA
for making NADPH and there is a disorder g6pd which can cause problems with creating NADPH because that diseases symptoms are almost entirely limited to red blood cells I want to talk about,81.479,31.031,112.50999999999999,NA
g6pd during the heme lectures which you'll see later pyruvate is sent through the Krebs cycle to create ATP the energy for which most of our protein processes occur don't forget you that's,97.53,28.859,126.38900000000001,NA
also how we can feed into the fatty acid metabolism pathway and we'll talk about some diseases of fatty acid metabolism as well also during fatty Addyson metabolism that's how we make ketones,111.93,28.051000000000002,139.981,NA
patients may have problems making ketones and we'll talk about some conditions there as well the pyruvate typically also sent over to start with amino acid metabolism both metabolizing,126.18,29.550000000000004,155.73000000000002,NA
but even more perhaps and handling amino acids can be a problem that patient with amino acid disorders so that some patients will have certain amino acids that they have a hard time digesting or,139.8,25.62,165.42000000000002,NA
managing in an effective way and don't forget amino acids may be disposed of and in particular the nitrogen in amino acids is disposed of through the urea cycle and patients can absolutely have,153.18,26.880000000000003,180.06,sad
your rhea cycle defects and we'll talk about some of those as well so this is the overview for metabolic pathways and we're going to focus on some common deficiencies in these pathways,167.19,23.77,190.96,NA
[Music] you,186.49,15.168,201.65800000000002,NA
