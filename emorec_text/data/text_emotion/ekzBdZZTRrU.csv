for developing diabetes. So and it's defined by  ",0.03,10.68,10.709999999999999,sad

"through this slide. So there are several ways of 
diagnosing diabetes. You can measure a",18.42,6.18,24.6,NA
"fasting plasma glucose in the morning. You can do 
an oral glucose tolerance test where you consume  ",24.6,6.87,31.470000000000002,NA
"75 grams of glucose and then check your glucose 
two hours later, or you can measure your HbA1c.  ",31.47,8.37,39.839999999999996,NA
"And I'll come back to HbA1c in a moment, but just 
just look at the yellow row, that's normal. So if  ",39.84,9.96,49.800000000000004,NA
"your fasting glucose is less than hundred or you 
have an O GTT, you don't have to do at OG it but  ",49.8,6.09,55.89,NA
"if you do if it's less than 140 or if your A1c is 
less than five point seven you're normal. Now if you  ",55.89,7.08,62.97,NA
"are being tested for diabetes, if your numbers 
126 fasting or higher than you have diabetes,  ",62.97,7.71,70.67999999999999,NA

than 200, or if you're A1c is greater than  ",70.68,6.36,77.04,NA

between is the gray zone. That's your pre-diabetes, ",77.04,7.26,84.30000000000001,NA
"so anyone in the gray zone, so if you have a 
fasting glucose between 100 and 125, you have  ",84.3,8.88,93.17999999999999,NA

risk for diabetes. So anybody in these gray zones on  ",102.36,8.85,111.21,NA

facts about pre-diabetes. If you use the American  ",131.97,7.14,139.10999999999999,NA

So as I mentioned you're in that gray zone, you  ",152.25,8.97,161.22,NA

you're in that gray set. Now you can switch to  ",161.22,5.67,166.89,fear

percent per year. It will vary a little bit  ",180.99,5.7,186.69,NA
