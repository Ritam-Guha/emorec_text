"- So pre-diabetes what is it? It is the high risk state 
for developing diabetes. So and it's defined by   test values that are higher than normal but lower 
than the diabetes diagnosis. So let me take you   through this slide. So there are several ways of 
diagnosing diabetes. You can measure a fasting plasma glucose in the morning. You can do 
an oral glucose tolerance test where you consume   75 grams of glucose and then check your glucose 
two hours later, or you can measure your HbA1c.  ",0.03,39.81,39.84,angry
"And I'll come back to HbA1c in a moment, but just 
just look at the yellow row, that's normal. So if   your fasting glucose is less than hundred or you 
have an O GTT, you don't have to do at OG it but   if you do if it's less than 140 or if your A1c is 
less than five point seven you're normal. Now if you   are being tested for diabetes, if your numbers 
126 fasting or higher than you have diabetes,   or if your two-hour glucose value is greater 
than 200, or if you're A1c is greater than  ",39.84,37.2,77.04,NA
"6.5 or greater, so that's how you diagnose. So in 
between is the gray zone. That's your pre-diabetes,  so anyone in the gray zone, so if you have a 
fasting glucose between 100 and 125, you have   impaired fasting glucose IFG. If your 140 to 199 
on an O GTT you have impaired glucose tolerance,   and if you're A1c is 5.7 to 6.5 you're at high 
risk for diabetes. So anybody in these gray zones on   whichever of these tests is used is referred to 
having in pre-diabetes. You want to be careful  ",77.04,40.38,117.42000000000002,NA
"these are artificial cut points made by a bunch 
of doctors, and you know you should be a little   cynical about doctors I should tell you. I always 
tell my patients doctors are bad for your health   and I thought that is true. Well let me give you some 
facts about pre-diabetes. If you use the American   Diabetes Association defined test cut-offs, you 
know answering your question about changes, but   these are the current guides, then about a third 
of the US population has pre-diabetes, and about  ",117.42,34.32,151.74,NA
"half of the adults 65 or older have pre-diabetes. 
So as I mentioned you're in that gray zone, you   don't have diabetes but you're not normal, so 
you're in that gray set. Now you can switch to   both sides, you can go from grey zone to normal 
and from the grey zone to the diabetic zone. So   about two percent of people with pre-diabetes 
progress to diabetes every year, so they go from   the grey zone to the diabetes zone about two 
percent per year. It will vary a little bit  ",152.25,34.44,186.69,NA
"because it depends on the genetic risks in that 
particular populations or certain populations   that that transition might be higher. In other 
populations it might be lower, and people can   become normal as I mentioned. So you can go 
from grey zone to normality and pre-diabetes   can convert back to normal. In one study in the UK 
86% became normal in ten years. So it's not always   true that everybody will progress. I think you 
have to keep an optimistic mind on these things.",186.69,32.309999999999995,219.0,NA
