hey guys I had a recent question related to monk fruit and stevia and riether tall and xylitol which one's the best which ones there were so let's just talk about these four sweeteners monk fruit,0.03,24.509,24.539,angry
and stevia and recruit all all have a zero glycemic index so they will not increase insulin okay xylitol on the glycemic index is thirty so it's low but it's still a little,11.7,29.61,41.31,NA
spike if you consume this one in small amounts it should not be a problem now I do use xylitol for a lot of different recipes simply because it really tastes just like sugar okay,26.64,29.009999999999998,55.65,NA
stevia has a little bit of an aftertaste but this is really good in things like like flavoring water and carbonated water to make like a soda and it's good in certain recipes monk fruit also has a,41.67,24.54,66.21000000000001,NA
slight little aftertaste it's really really sweet so you don't need much of it but both of these are very similar there they kind of give a little bit of an aftertaste they don't really taste a,53.82,18.93,72.75,NA
hundred percent like sugar but they're good in certain recipes but not in others I don't really use this one as much I use stevia a little bit more now riether tall doesn't have the aftertaste,63.66,23.491,87.151,NA
but it definitely does not taste like xylitol it has more of a cold taste a cold sweet taste but I still use this in recipes because it's great to combine this maybe with this or these two,75.18,28.559000000000005,103.739,NA
together and to have the the right balance now the other point about the wreath throat roll is sometimes it's made from corn which is GMO so you want to make sure this one is non-gmo okay,89.22,28.2,117.42,NA
same thing with xylitol this you want this from birch bark and non-gmo and if you're actually chewing gum make sure it's xylitol gum and don't worry about it interfering with your,103.35,24.091,127.441,NA
intermittent fasting it's not going to bump you out of ketosis it's such a small amount that gum that you don't want to consume is the gum with aspartame you want to avoid these,115.86,21.479999999999997,137.34,NA
artificial sweeteners these are sugar alcohols and this is a fruit and this is from a plant these are totally fine there's a lot of other sugar alcohols and natural,126.09,21.539,147.62900000000002,NA
sweeteners that you can do but these are the common ones right here between these two I found this one tends to give people a little more digestive problem it consumed in larger amounts this one,137.34,27.69,165.03,NA
can be as well but if you're having small amounts it doesn't seem to be a problem but when you start making these keto bombs or these recipes but it just tastes so good you want to eat a lot of,150.78,20.100999999999996,170.881,NA
it well then you'll start getting some problems because they can act as a laxative or give you gas and sometimes you'll hear this idea that if you consume anything sweet whether it's monk,161.22,19.739,180.959,NA
fruit or stevia even know it's zero calories it's still gonna spike insulin i've never had a problem with that i never see a problem with that i wouldn't worry about it thanks for watching hey I,170.819,23.43,194.249,NA
