">> SCOTT: I only get to do this YouTube video
in one take so I hope you'll bear with me. So, as a diabetic, when I eat my blood sugar
goes up, when I take insulin, my blood sugar goes down. It's kind of like flying a plane and adjusting
the altitude.",0.0,15.7,15.7,NA
"Eat it goes up, insulin it goes down. So I try to ""fly"" nice and steady, so I don't
crash into the ground, and I don't float away. Typically I use a needle to give myself that
insulin. My body doesn't produce any insulin. My pancreas doesn't work.",15.7,15.828999999999999,31.528999999999996,angry
"I can give myself a shot here and there, but at some point I'm gonna be giving myself
8 to 10 shots. So I use what's called an insulin pump. And my insulin pump sits right here. It sits
on my belt. It's got a little bunch of insulin right there,",31.529,14.441,45.97,NA
"a big long tube, and it's plugged into me. It's plugged into me all the time. See these bruises? That's because I'm putting
holes in myself faster than I can heal them. When the insulin pump runs out, like it did
tonight, I have to fill it up. So here's what I do when I change my insulin
pump.",45.97,16.580000000000002,62.55,NA
"I take this off. This is a little port. Pull
this off me. Now I've got a hole in me. That's the little needle - it's called a ""cannula""
 - that was sticking in me. That's where the insulin came out. Throw that
away. Then I'm going to take the insulin pump, pull
out the tubing, this is disposable; this goes away.",62.55,22.07,84.62,NA
"Now I've got an empty insulin pump. I'm gonna tell this pump to rewind and get
ready for a new bunch of insulin. See that ""screw drive"" that's moving backwards
right there? That's the plunger. That's rewinding. You
can hear it. While that's rewinding, I'll take a fresh
""reservoir""",84.62,20.2,104.82000000000001,NA
"and a bunch of insulin. Push air into it. Now I'm pulling it out,
filling up the reservoir with insulin. I do this every three days. Insulin is measured in ""units."" I give myself
about 30 units a day. Disconnect it, insulin goes away, now I've
got a reservoir full of insulin.",104.82,23.28,128.1,NA
"Now I take this, this is also disposable.
I have to buy these. This is pretty expensive. This is that tubing, it's a fresh one. Plug the reservoir into the tubing. I'll take this and put it inside the pump, Take that and put it inside the pump and tell
the pump that I've got some.",128.1,23.87,151.97,NA
"And it's going to start to push. And It's filling up the tube. See that? See the insulin dropping out? I'll put the pump down temporarily. Take this thing here and I'm going put it
inside this.",151.97,19.13,171.1,NA
"This a little plunger and I'm gonna put this
on top if it. This is a little sticker. I'll pull the sticker
off. See that blue thing on top, there's a needle
under there. Push it down into the plunger, pull that off;
needle's in there. Use my arm.",171.1,22.439999999999998,193.54,NA
"[INHALES, EXHALES SHARPLY. SNAP!] >> SCOTT: Now it's plugged in me. Pull out
the needle, that's the needle. Remember that one we threw away earlier? This little plastic tube is in there. So now, the pump is plugged into the tube
which is plugged into me.",193.54,27.39,220.93,NA
"I wear it 24 hours a day. I wear it when I
sleep, I put it underneath my pillow. Clip it onto my belt. 24 hours a day. The only time I take it off is for a few minutes
when I shower. So this is easier than shots. And now I can do little tiny adjustments to
my ""plane"" that's flying.",220.93,16.57,237.5,NA
"Unfortunately though, pump are expensive. A lot of people who don't live in Western
Countries can't get ahold of pumps. There's a lot of money here, These are a couple
thousand bucks. They're usually paid for by insurance but
you'll usually have to fight your insurance company to get one.",237.5,11.59,249.09,NA
"So that's thing number one. Every three days, I do this maneuver that
we just did. Every three days. I'll take the pump, put it in my pocket. Thing number two, I'm going to put in a Continuous
Glucose Meter. Sometimes you hear about diabetic who prick
their finger.",249.09,15.059999999999999,264.15,angry
"They look at the blood on their finger and
they measure it and that tells you what your blood sugar is. It's like looking at your altimeter on an
airplane, seeing what your altitude. But there are things called Continuous Glucose
Meters that allow you to get that information more often.",264.15,12.88,277.03,happy
"I prick my finger between 8 and 10 times a
day. I've got black marks and calluses on my finger
from doing this for 15 years. This is a sensor, these are expensive, again,
fighting with the insurance to get these things. This going to allow me to check my blood sugar
every 5 minutes. This sensor - looks kind of like a mosquito
 - has a sticker and a needle.",277.03,21.029,298.05899999999997,NA
"You'll notice that one of the thigns about
diabetes is that there's a lot of needles... and it sucks. This is another one of those ""inserter"" deals. [SNAP] [POP]",298.059,10.29,308.34900000000005,NA
">> SCOTT: OK? Take that... and put this inside it. The little mosquito
deal. You'll find yourself as a diabetic finding
new and creative ways to stick yourself. And the irony is, you have to hurt yourself
all the time while you're diabetic, so you can avoid hurting yourself later when
you're old and things are going bad.",308.349,29.220000000000002,337.569,NA
"Pull the little sticker off. See that, right
there? Pull the plastic off this needle. OK? So that needle is now going to go in me. And this is where some of the, more of the,
fat belly stuff is going to happen. Forgive me. I'm working out, but whadayagonnado?",337.569,18.701,356.27000000000004,NA
"Again this may look bruised, like there's
holes and stuff, it's because I'm putting holes in me faster than I can
heal them. I'm going to take this needle... ...looking for a place where I can sense... [INHALES]",356.27,17.489,373.75899999999996,NA
">> SCOTT: You'll hear me breathing because
it hurts. [INHALES, EXHALES, POP!] >> SCOTT: OK. Pull the sticker, now that's
sticking in me. Pull it out. [EXHALES] >> SCOTT: There's your needle. OK, now, that
left the sensor in me.",373.759,32.28,406.039,NA
"Now, I take a battery. This battery is sitting
on a charger. This is from a company called Minimed, see
it's blinking. Put that sensor right here. [CLICK] >> SCOTT: Just plugged it in. Now I'll take
some ""second skin.""",406.039,23.12,429.159,NA
"This is a, it's kind of a clear sticker. I'll take this clear sticker and stick it over here. I do this about every 36 hours. They're waterproof, so I can leave that on
now",429.159,21.91,451.069,NA
"for a while. So that guy's sitting there. This senses my blood sugar. K, that sips, sips the interstitial fluids... Not the blood, but the interstitial fluids",451.069,11.791,462.86,angry
and then sends the results to this pump. Then I have to use my brain sometimes Microsoft Excel to figure out how much insulin to give myself. Then I tell the pump,462.86,10.369,473.22900000000004,happy
"[4 SLOW BEEPS] That I want to give myself 2 units [4 FAST ESCALATING BEEPS] It says are you sure 2 units? and I say, yep,
I'm sure. And now it's delivering.",473.229,13.8,487.029,NA
"So very, very slowly, that little plunger
that we saw before is turning and it's delivering insulin. It's going all the way through this tube,
into here. This gives me information that I use to drive
this. Now, the fun part. Every 43 days, this is
all the medical waste now.",487.029,21.021,508.05,NA
"Needles, gotta put this in a ""sharps"" container. We changed the pump, we changed the tubing,
we changed the reservoir... We changed the needles for the continuous
meter. I use a hundred and something units of insulin. So here's the part that freaks me out and
here's why I'm doing this video in the first",508.05,22.919999999999998,530.97,NA
"place. I'm 36 years old and I can handle this. I didn't say that it was fun, but I can handle
this. But imagine if you were seven, or 9 months
old, or 3. And you had to do something like this.",530.97,13.6,544.57,NA
"Whether it's pricking your finger 10 times
a day and taking shots, or a whole bunch of tubing and wires. 24 hours
a day. We do it because we want to live. We do it because we want to live for our kids
and to be around for a long time. But it's no fun.",544.57,16.33,560.9000000000001,NA
"And I would encourage you if you can, if you
know someone with diabetes, if you have someone you love who has diabetes. Please give money. I'm personally raising
money for the American Diabetes Association. Hanselman.com slash fightdiabetes I'm going to put a link at the bottom of this
video right here.",560.9,23.91,584.81,NA
"You can read my story and hopefully start
learning a little about diabetes and I hope that this YouTube video helped you
out because it hurt me a little bit. Thanks a lot!",584.81,9.09,593.9,NA
