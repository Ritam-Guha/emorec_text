hey guys today I'm going to talk about,0.03,3.869,3.899,happy
one of the dangers of having glucose in,1.439,4.44,5.8790000000000004,happy
your urine so let's say for example you,3.899,3.871,7.77,happy
have a glucose tester and you find,5.879,4.321,10.2,happy
glucose in the urine that means that,7.77,4.17,11.94,happy
your blood sugars the glucose in your,10.2,6.12,16.32,happy
blood is minimally at 225 okay or more,11.94,6.839,18.779,happy
and it's spilling off into the urine so,16.32,4.14,20.46,neutral
this is one of the ways that the body is,18.779,4.17,22.948999999999998,NA
trying to get rid of this toxic glucose,20.46,4.59,25.05,happy
okay by just peeing it out,22.949,4.801,27.75,happy
it's called osmotic diuresis and the,25.05,4.979,30.029,happy
complication of having this is that it,27.75,5.54,33.29,NA
pulls out minerals specifically,30.029,6.751,36.78,happy
potassium sodium chloride and other,33.29,6.49,39.78,happy
minerals and it leaves you dehydrated,36.78,5.189,41.969,happy
okay that's what happens with a diabetic,39.78,4.529,44.309,happy
and not having the correct mineral in,41.969,5.25,47.219,happy
fluid ratio gives you a headache you can,44.309,6.961,51.269999999999996,happy
start having fatigue confusion your,47.219,5.851,53.07,happy
nails become purple that's one of the,51.27,3.75,55.02,happy
symptoms and a lot of heart problems,53.07,3.809,56.879,NA
arrhythmia problems because you need,55.02,3.6,58.620000000000005,NA
these electrolytes to keep the heart in,56.879,3.961,60.839999999999996,NA
rhythm and so it sets you up for,58.62,4.5,63.12,happy
increasing risk for having a heart,60.84,2.609,63.449000000000005,happy
attack,63.12,3.06,66.17999999999999,happy
now on top of that usually a diabetic,63.449,4.591,68.03999999999999,happy
has high blood pressure and they're,66.18,4.14,70.32000000000001,happy
taking diuretics which also pull out,68.04,4.23,72.27000000000001,happy
these electrolytes and many times they,70.32,3.75,74.07,happy
also have digestive issues they might be,72.27,4.86,77.13,NA
in some anti acid which also blocks the,74.07,4.65,78.72,happy
absorption of minerals from the stomach,77.13,3.27,80.39999999999999,happy
level so we're gonna actually have even,78.72,4.649,83.369,happy
less minerals and if they're drinking a,80.4,5.85,86.25,happy
lot of water without these minerals,83.369,4.86,88.229,happy
they're flushing out more minerals,86.25,4.14,90.39,happy
they're actually diluting the urine you,88.229,3.421,91.65,happy
have to understand that we need these,90.39,4.32,94.71000000000001,happy
minerals to help reverse the blood sugar,91.65,5.19,96.84,happy
problem in the first place in fact if,94.71,3.96,98.66999999999999,happy
you take potassium it actually can help,96.84,4.56,101.4,happy
your blood Sugar's improve also one of,98.67,4.83,103.5,happy
the symptoms of a low salt diet is,101.4,4.259,105.659,happy
insulin resistance so having these,103.5,4.5,108.0,happy
minerals with salt and potassium and,105.659,5.161,110.82000000000001,NA
magnesium are crucial in helping your,108.0,4.86,112.86,NA
blood Sugar's so if you're noticing you,110.82,3.24,114.05999999999999,NA

understand what's really happening so,114.06,4.379,118.43900000000001,happy
don't just stop by taking these minerals,115.86,5.28,121.14,happy
to prevent dehydration symptoms actually,118.439,5.131,123.57,happy
