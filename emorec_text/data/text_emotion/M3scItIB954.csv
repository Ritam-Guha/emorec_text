hey guys today I'm going to talk about,0.03,3.869,3.899,
one of the dangers of having glucose in,1.439,4.44,5.8790000000000004,
your urine so let's say for example you,3.899,3.871,7.77,
have a glucose tester and you find,5.879,4.321,10.2,
glucose in the urine that means that,7.77,4.17,11.94,
your blood sugars the glucose in your,10.2,6.12,16.32,
blood is minimally at 225 okay or more,11.94,6.839,18.779,
and it's spilling off into the urine so,16.32,4.14,20.46,
this is one of the ways that the body is,18.779,4.17,22.948999999999998,
trying to get rid of this toxic glucose,20.46,4.59,25.05,
okay by just peeing it out,22.949,4.801,27.75,
it's called osmotic diuresis and the,25.05,4.979,30.029,
complication of having this is that it,27.75,5.54,33.29,
pulls out minerals specifically,30.029,6.751,36.78,
potassium sodium chloride and other,33.29,6.49,39.78,
minerals and it leaves you dehydrated,36.78,5.189,41.969,
okay that's what happens with a diabetic,39.78,4.529,44.309,
and not having the correct mineral in,41.969,5.25,47.219,
fluid ratio gives you a headache you can,44.309,6.961,51.269999999999996,happy
start having fatigue confusion your,47.219,5.851,53.07,happy
nails become purple that's one of the,51.27,3.75,55.02,
symptoms and a lot of heart problems,53.07,3.809,56.879,
arrhythmia problems because you need,55.02,3.6,58.620000000000005,
these electrolytes to keep the heart in,56.879,3.961,60.839999999999996,
rhythm and so it sets you up for,58.62,4.5,63.12,
increasing risk for having a heart,60.84,2.609,63.449000000000005,
attack,63.12,3.06,66.17999999999999,
now on top of that usually a diabetic,63.449,4.591,68.03999999999999,
has high blood pressure and they're,66.18,4.14,70.32000000000001,happy
taking diuretics which also pull out,68.04,4.23,72.27000000000001,
these electrolytes and many times they,70.32,3.75,74.07,
also have digestive issues they might be,72.27,4.86,77.13,
in some anti acid which also blocks the,74.07,4.65,78.72,
absorption of minerals from the stomach,77.13,3.27,80.39999999999999,
level so we're gonna actually have even,78.72,4.649,83.369,happy
less minerals and if they're drinking a,80.4,5.85,86.25,
lot of water without these minerals,83.369,4.86,88.229,
they're flushing out more minerals,86.25,4.14,90.39,
they're actually diluting the urine you,88.229,3.421,91.65,
have to understand that we need these,90.39,4.32,94.71000000000001,
minerals to help reverse the blood sugar,91.65,5.19,96.84,happy
problem in the first place in fact if,94.71,3.96,98.66999999999999,
you take potassium it actually can help,96.84,4.56,101.4,
your blood Sugar's improve also one of,98.67,4.83,103.5,
the symptoms of a low salt diet is,101.4,4.259,105.659,
insulin resistance so having these,103.5,4.5,108.0,
minerals with salt and potassium and,105.659,5.161,110.82000000000001,
magnesium are crucial in helping your,108.0,4.86,112.86,
blood Sugar's so if you're noticing you,110.82,3.24,114.05999999999999,
have glucose in the urine now you,112.86,3.0,115.86,
understand what's really happening so,114.06,4.379,118.43900000000001,
don't just stop by taking these minerals,115.86,5.28,121.14,
to prevent dehydration symptoms actually,118.439,5.131,123.57,happy
fix the reason why it's occurring in the,121.14,4.5,125.64,
first place so I'm gonna recommend two,123.57,3.78,127.35,
