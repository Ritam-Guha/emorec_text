"Hey, I'm Dr. Josh Axe and welcome to Transformation
TV. This week I'm going to be talking about artificial
sweeteners which are some of the most deadly compounds on the planet. You and your family want to stay completely
away from artificial sweeteners. Now, artificial sweeteners, most of the time
they came about accidentally, not even on",3.49,19.23,22.72,angry
"purpose, but people found they had a sweet
texture and taste to them and actually the number one used sweetener of the past two
decades has been artificial sweetener known as aspartame. Aspartame first started being used in diet
coke and actually they saw, in 1981, when Diet Coke was introduced on the market, brain
tumors increased with it exponentially and",22.72,24.560000000000002,47.28,angry
"so they rose in correlation with it and that
was just one big side effect. Now, another study down at the University
of Texas found that aspartame caused kidney damage and weight gain. Lots of you think, ""Well, I'm drinking a Diet
Coke or a diet soda. Shouldn't that cause my weight to decrease?""",47.28,19.849999999999998,67.13,angry
"Actually, at the University of Texas they
found for every diet soda you drink, your chance of weight gain goes up by 41%, and
the reason is that these are toxic chemicals. Toxins get stored in your fat cells if you're
drinking lots of diet soda. It's going to be stored in your cells and
your body cannot burn fat and lose weight. So if you're trying to lose weight, kick the
diet soda immediately.",67.13,26.36,93.49,angry
"One of the most dangerous things and facts
to know about aspartame is what it breaks down into. Actually, aspartame breaks down in your body
into wood alcohol, formaldehyde, and ethanol which are toxic chemicals and they're known
to be carcinogenic. They actually cause cancer, and that's why
you want to stay away from these.",93.49,18.68,112.16999999999999,angry
"There's a great documentary out there called
""Sweet Misery."" If you want to get a whole DVD series on this,
again you are going to want to go watch the DVD, ""Sweet Misery."" Another artificial sweetener that is shockingly
dangerous is Sucralose, and it's found in a product called Splenda.",112.17,17.66,129.83,angry
"A lot of people think, ""Well, Splenda, I thought
that was a health food or I thought it came from sugar."" Splenda started off coming from sugar, but
they add a chlorine ion, a chlorine molecule onto the sugar and so basically what happens,
if you're drinking Splenda or Sucralose, it's breaking down in your body as chlorine.",129.83,20.499999999999996,150.33,angry
"I actually recently had a patient come into
my clinic and they told me about a friend of theirs who had just been hospitalized for
three days for chlorine poisoning, and the doctors told them it was from her using too
much Splenda. She was actually using cups of Splenda in
her baking and sweetening and actually found that it caused chlorine poisoning in her body.",150.33,20.009999999999998,170.34,angry
"So if you are doing Splenda, again, plan on
or just know that it's chlorine. It's like drinking chlorinated water. It causes cancer. You want to stay completely away from these
artificial sweeteners. Now, places you're going to want to look for
these artificial sweeteners and the names",170.34,16.79,187.13,angry
"you're going to be looking for, the top two
names to look for are Sucralose and aspartame. Now, if you ever use protein powders, you've
got to look in your protein powders for these. Number one, if you're drinking a diet soda,
99% of the time it's going to have Sucralose or Splenda in it. Even things like Crystal Light and a lot of
the different sweeteners out there, you're",187.13,22.701,209.831,angry
"going to find they have these artificial sweeteners
in them. You got to read your labels. You do not want to bring in this stuff in. Honestly, I'd rather someone drink regular
sugar than do artificial sweeteners because they're neurotoxins, they're toxic chemicals.",209.831,15.459,225.29,angry
"Here's what you want to do instead. You want to switch over to an all-natural
sweetener, something like stevia. Now, this is personally what I use, but stevia
is an all-natural sweetener that comes from the herb of a flower and it's no calories,
and so it's not going to cause the added weight gain.",225.29,17.06,242.35,angry
"So add a little bit of stevia into things
the like berry smoothies that I do. If I want to sweeten something up a little
bit, again, stevia is a great option, all natural. Some other things you can do, you got to be
careful of the sugar content, but raw honey, Grade B maple syrup and things like coconut
nectar are other good options and fruit, but",242.35,19.219,261.569,NA
"that's where I'd go ahead and stick with when
you're trying to sweeten things up. Again, if you want to do no-sugar, though,
stevia is the way to go, and there's a lot of all-natural products coming out that you're
going to find at natural health food stores that actually contain stevia. This is a way you want to go.",261.569,15.460999999999999,277.03000000000003,NA
"So remember, action steps for the week, get
rid of all the artificial sweeteners. Get rid of the aspartame, get rid of the Sucralose,
switch over to stevia and the all-natural sweeteners. It may just save your life and a friend. If you like this, think about the people you
know who are at work or at your church or",277.03,15.969000000000001,292.99899999999997,NA
"the places you go to who are addicted to diet
soda and tell them about this. Spread this message. You may just save a life. I'll see you next week.",292.999,7.9,300.899,NA
