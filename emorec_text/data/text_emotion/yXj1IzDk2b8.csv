hello everyone and welcome back to,0.48,3.12,3.6,angry
clinical cousins youtube channel where,1.839,5.281,7.119999999999999,angry
today we're going to be going over nph,3.6,6.88,10.48,angry
insulin also known as humulin n,7.12,6.0,13.120000000000001,angry
this is classified as an intermediate,10.48,5.119,15.599,angry
acting insulin and is given for diabetes,13.12,5.239,18.358999999999998,angry
mellitus 1 and 2 and general,15.599,4.401,20.0,angry
hyperglycemia,18.359,5.241,23.6,angry
now you cannot take this drug or insulin,20.0,6.08,26.08,angry
with alcohol or if your patient has,23.6,3.999,27.599,angry
hypoglycemia,26.08,3.92,30.0,angry
and this drug has not been proven to be,27.599,4.0,31.599,angry
safe in pregnancy,30.0,4.399,34.399,happy
now what we need to know is that this,31.599,5.441,37.04,happy
drug binds to the transmembrane,34.399,5.761,40.160000000000004,happy
receptors and starts a cascade of,37.04,5.519,42.559,fear
actions that eventually result in the,40.16,6.559,46.718999999999994,angry
placement of glute4 transporters into,42.559,6.0,48.559,angry
the cell membrane,46.719,5.281,52.0,angry
this allows glucose to enter the cells,48.559,5.68,54.239,angry
by facilitated diffusion,52.0,5.199,57.199,angry
this also means that the glucose level,54.239,4.401,58.64,angry
in the plasma,57.199,3.2,60.399,angry
will decrease,58.64,4.559,63.199,angry
now it is very important that we also,60.399,5.521,65.92,angry
know that insulin has another very,63.199,4.321,67.52,angry
important action,65.92,4.8,70.72,angry
it will make potassium leave the blood,67.52,5.599,73.119,angry
and enter our cells,70.72,5.12,75.84,angry
insulin activates a chain of reactions,73.119,4.161,77.28,happy
that eventually,75.84,6.16,82.0,fear
stimulate our sodium potassium atpases,77.28,6.72,84.0,fear
these atp aces,82.0,5.759,87.759,
push sodium out of the cell and bring,84.0,6.159,90.159,happy
potassium in the cell,87.759,4.801,92.56,angry
this is very important because food has,90.159,5.28,95.43900000000001,angry
a lot of potassium if our bodies were to,92.56,5.28,97.84,angry
just simply absorb all this potassium,95.439,5.04,100.479,angry
and do nothing about it it may cause us,97.84,5.44,103.28,angry
to have paralytic and potentially fatal,100.479,4.161,104.64,angry
arrhythmias,103.28,4.4,107.68,angry
this is why it is a smart idea to intake,104.64,7.439,112.07900000000001,angry
glucose and potassium at the same time,107.68,6.24,113.92,happy
you should be aware that your patient's,112.079,4.64,116.719,angry
insulin need will increase as their body,113.92,6.159,120.07900000000001,angry
experiences stressors like surgery,116.719,6.481,123.19999999999999,angry
sickness trauma and fever,120.079,5.36,125.439,angry
also be aware of the possibility of,123.2,4.6,127.8,angry
developing a temporary,125.439,5.841,131.28,angry
hypokalemia with insulin administration,127.8,6.439,134.239,fear
now we should also know that this drug,131.28,6.319,137.599,fear
will begin to work in about one hour,134.239,6.881,141.12,fear
it will have a peak effect or a,137.599,4.921,142.51999999999998,fear
very low,141.12,5.199,146.31900000000002,angry
hypoglycemic effect at 8 hours and it,142.52,6.439,148.959,angry
will last for 24 hours,146.319,4.081,150.39999999999998,happy
some of the common side effects of this,148.959,3.721,152.68,
medication may include,150.4,4.08,154.48000000000002,happy
hypoglycemia,152.68,4.36,157.04000000000002,angry
pallor and tachycardia,154.48,3.839,158.319,angry
weight gain,157.04,2.08,159.12,
and,158.319,4.161,162.48,
lipo hypertrophy at the injection site,159.12,5.52,164.64000000000001,angry
some commonly tested material about this,162.48,6.16,168.64,angry
medication is that its address is 1 8,164.64,8.08,172.72,angry
24. meaning that it will take an hour to,168.64,7.92,176.55999999999997,angry
work meaning the onset is an hour,172.72,8.08,180.8,angry
it will have a peak hypoglycemic effect,176.56,7.84,184.4,angry
at 8 hours and it will last or have,180.8,7.68,188.48000000000002,angry
effects for a total of 24 hours,184.4,5.199,189.59900000000002,
now,188.48,2.56,191.04,fear
it's always important when you're,189.599,3.841,193.44,angry
administering insulin to monitor for,191.04,4.559,195.599,angry
both hypoglycemia,193.44,2.96,196.4,fear
and,195.599,3.121,198.72,fear
hypokalemia,196.4,3.68,200.08,
