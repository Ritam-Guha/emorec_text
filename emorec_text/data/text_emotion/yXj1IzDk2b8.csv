hello everyone and welcome back to clinical cousins youtube channel where today we're going to be going over nph insulin also known as humulin n this is classified as an intermediate,0.48,26.4,26.88,NA
acting insulin and is given for diabetes mellitus 1 and 2 and general hyperglycemia now you cannot take this drug or insulin with alcohol or if your patient has,13.12,24.959999999999997,38.08,NA
hypoglycemia and this drug has not been proven to be safe in pregnancy now what we need to know is that this drug binds to the transmembrane,26.08,23.520999999999997,49.601,NA
receptors and starts a cascade of actions that eventually result in the placement of glute4 transporters into the cell membrane this allows glucose to enter the cells,37.04,29.038999999999998,66.079,NA
by facilitated diffusion this also means that the glucose level in the plasma will decrease now it is very important that we also,52.0,22.880000000000003,74.88,NA
know that insulin has another very important action it will make potassium leave the blood and enter our cells insulin activates a chain of reactions,63.199,24.000999999999998,87.19999999999999,NA
that eventually stimulate our sodium potassium atpases these atp aces push sodium out of the cell and bring potassium in the cell,75.84,29.598999999999997,105.439,NA
this is very important because food has a lot of potassium if our bodies were to just simply absorb all this potassium and do nothing about it it may cause us to have paralytic and potentially fatal,90.159,25.201,115.36000000000001,NA
arrhythmias this is why it is a smart idea to intake glucose and potassium at the same time you should be aware that your patient's insulin need will increase as their body,103.28,28.878,132.15800000000002,NA
experiences stressors like surgery sickness trauma and fever also be aware of the possibility of developing a temporary hypokalemia with insulin administration,116.719,28.721000000000004,145.44,NA
now we should also know that this drug will begin to work in about one hour it will have a peak effect or a very low hypoglycemic effect at 8 hours and it,131.28,29.759,161.039,NA
will last for 24 hours some of the common side effects of this medication may include hypoglycemia pallor and tachycardia,146.319,20.081,166.39999999999998,NA
weight gain and lipo hypertrophy at the injection site some commonly tested material about this medication is that its address is 1 8,157.04,26.000999999999998,183.041,NA
24. meaning that it will take an hour to work meaning the onset is an hour it will have a peak hypoglycemic effect at 8 hours and it will last or have effects for a total of 24 hours,168.64,36.719,205.35899999999998,NA
now it's always important when you're administering insulin to monitor for both hypoglycemia and,188.48,17.041,205.521,NA
hypokalemia as always thank you for taking the time to learn with us today and remember to like and subscribe for more content,196.4,16.560000000000002,212.96,NA
