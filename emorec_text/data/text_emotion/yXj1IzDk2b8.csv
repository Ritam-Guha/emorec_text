hello everyone and welcome back to,0.48,3.12,3.6,neutral
clinical cousins youtube channel where,1.839,5.281,7.119999999999999,neutral
today we're going to be going over nph,3.6,6.88,10.48,neutral
insulin also known as humulin n,7.12,6.0,13.120000000000001,neutral
this is classified as an intermediate,10.48,5.119,15.599,neutral
acting insulin and is given for diabetes,13.12,5.239,18.358999999999998,sad
mellitus 1 and 2 and general,15.599,4.401,20.0,neutral
hyperglycemia,18.359,5.241,23.6,neutral
now you cannot take this drug or insulin,20.0,6.08,26.08,neutral
with alcohol or if your patient has,23.6,3.999,27.599,neutral
hypoglycemia,26.08,3.92,30.0,neutral
and this drug has not been proven to be,27.599,4.0,31.599,neutral
safe in pregnancy,30.0,4.399,34.399,neutral
now what we need to know is that this,31.599,5.441,37.04,neutral
drug binds to the transmembrane,34.399,5.761,40.160000000000004,neutral
receptors and starts a cascade of,37.04,5.519,42.559,neutral
actions that eventually result in the,40.16,6.559,46.718999999999994,neutral
placement of glute4 transporters into,42.559,6.0,48.559,neutral
the cell membrane,46.719,5.281,52.0,neutral
this allows glucose to enter the cells,48.559,5.68,54.239,neutral
by facilitated diffusion,52.0,5.199,57.199,neutral
this also means that the glucose level,54.239,4.401,58.64,neutral
in the plasma,57.199,3.2,60.399,neutral
will decrease,58.64,4.559,63.199,neutral
now it is very important that we also,60.399,5.521,65.92,neutral
know that insulin has another very,63.199,4.321,67.52,neutral
important action,65.92,4.8,70.72,neutral
it will make potassium leave the blood,67.52,5.599,73.119,neutral
and enter our cells,70.72,5.12,75.84,neutral
insulin activates a chain of reactions,73.119,4.161,77.28,neutral
that eventually,75.84,6.16,82.0,neutral
stimulate our sodium potassium atpases,77.28,6.72,84.0,neutral
these atp aces,82.0,5.759,87.759,neutral
push sodium out of the cell and bring,84.0,6.159,90.159,neutral
potassium in the cell,87.759,4.801,92.56,neutral
this is very important because food has,90.159,5.28,95.43900000000001,neutral
a lot of potassium if our bodies were to,92.56,5.28,97.84,neutral
just simply absorb all this potassium,95.439,5.04,100.479,neutral
and do nothing about it it may cause us,97.84,5.44,103.28,neutral
to have paralytic and potentially fatal,100.479,4.161,104.64,neutral
arrhythmias,103.28,4.4,107.68,neutral
this is why it is a smart idea to intake,104.64,7.439,112.07900000000001,neutral
glucose and potassium at the same time,107.68,6.24,113.92,neutral
you should be aware that your patient's,112.079,4.64,116.719,neutral
insulin need will increase as their body,113.92,6.159,120.07900000000001,neutral
experiences stressors like surgery,116.719,6.481,123.19999999999999,neutral
sickness trauma and fever,120.079,5.36,125.439,neutral
also be aware of the possibility of,123.2,4.6,127.8,neutral
developing a temporary,125.439,5.841,131.28,neutral
hypokalemia with insulin administration,127.8,6.439,134.239,neutral
now we should also know that this drug,131.28,6.319,137.599,neutral
will begin to work in about one hour,134.239,6.881,141.12,neutral
it will have a peak effect or a,137.599,4.921,142.51999999999998,neutral
very low,141.12,5.199,146.31900000000002,neutral
hypoglycemic effect at 8 hours and it,142.52,6.439,148.959,neutral
will last for 24 hours,146.319,4.081,150.39999999999998,neutral
some of the common side effects of this,148.959,3.721,152.68,neutral
medication may include,150.4,4.08,154.48000000000002,neutral
hypoglycemia,152.68,4.36,157.04000000000002,neutral
pallor and tachycardia,154.48,3.839,158.319,neutral
weight gain,157.04,2.08,159.12,neutral
and,158.319,4.161,162.48,neutral
lipo hypertrophy at the injection site,159.12,5.52,164.64000000000001,neutral
some commonly tested material about this,162.48,6.16,168.64,neutral
medication is that its address is 1 8,164.64,8.08,172.72,neutral
24. meaning that it will take an hour to,168.64,7.92,176.55999999999997,neutral
work meaning the onset is an hour,172.72,8.08,180.8,neutral
it will have a peak hypoglycemic effect,176.56,7.84,184.4,neutral
at 8 hours and it will last or have,180.8,7.68,188.48000000000002,neutral
effects for a total of 24 hours,184.4,5.199,189.59900000000002,neutral
now,188.48,2.56,191.04,neutral
it's always important when you're,189.599,3.841,193.44,neutral
administering insulin to monitor for,191.04,4.559,195.599,neutral
both hypoglycemia,193.44,2.96,196.4,fear
and,195.599,3.121,198.72,neutral
hypokalemia,196.4,3.68,200.08,neutral
