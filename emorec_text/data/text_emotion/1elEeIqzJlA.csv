hba1c is a blood test that shows how,0.0,4.17,4.17,fear
well you are controlling your blood,2.73,4.23,6.960000000000001,fear
sugar over time it does this by taking a,4.17,4.71,8.879999999999999,happy
look at how much sugar is attached to,6.96,4.44,11.4,fear
your red blood cells the more sugar that,8.88,5.4,14.280000000000001,fear
is attached the higher your hba1c in,11.4,5.82,17.22,fear
this video we'll take a look at how this,14.28,5.43,19.71,happy
test works and ways to keep your results,17.22,7.559,24.779,happy
in the healthy range hba1c goes by,19.71,7.26,26.97,happy
different names so you might hear it,24.779,5.971,30.75,happy
referred to as simply the a1c test the,26.97,6.99,33.96,
hemoglobin a1c test or the glycated,30.75,6.12,36.87,
hemoglobin test and while this last name,33.96,5.04,39.0,happy
is the most complex it does the best job,36.87,4.38,41.25,happy
of explaining what the test measures,39.0,5.16,44.16,happy
which is the amount of sugar or glucose,41.25,5.489,46.739,happy
that is sticking to a specific protein,44.16,4.079,48.239,
in your red blood cells called,46.739,4.59,51.32899999999999,
hemoglobin the process of glucose,48.239,5.131,53.37,
binding to hemoglobin is called,51.329,4.681,56.01,
glycation hence the name the glycated,53.37,5.91,59.28,
hemoglobin test your red blood cells are,56.01,5.4,61.41,
great targets for this test because of,59.28,4.29,63.57,neutral
their unique structure and how they use,61.41,5.1,66.50999999999999,happy
glucose to survive red blood cells are,63.57,5.159,68.729,happy
plentiful in your bloodstream and their,66.51,4.35,70.86,happy
primary job is to carry oxygen around,68.729,4.801,73.53,happy
your body and they take their job very,70.86,5.7,76.56,happy
seriously so we see that as red blood,73.53,5.699,79.229,happy
cells mature they fill up with more and,76.56,4.949,81.509,happy
more hemoglobin which is the protein,79.229,4.89,84.119,
that actually carries the oxygen but,81.509,4.68,86.189,
this accumulation of hemoglobin makes,84.119,4.86,88.979,
things very cramped inside the cells so,86.189,4.86,91.04899999999999,
to make room mature red blood cells,88.979,4.231,93.21,
sacrifice their mitochondria,91.049,4.771,95.82000000000001,
mitochondria are the powerhouses that,93.21,4.53,97.74,
the majority of your cells rely on to,95.82,4.53,100.35,happy
make energy without these powerhouses,97.74,4.83,102.57,happy
your red blood cells must get their,100.35,4.229,104.579,happy
energy through a much less efficient,102.57,4.2,106.77,happy
process that involves the fermentation,104.579,6.241,110.82,happy
of glucose and while this process works,106.77,7.32,114.09,happy
it wears the cells out quickly so the,110.82,5.88,116.69999999999999,happy
average lifespan of a red blood cell is,114.09,5.04,119.13000000000001,happy
relatively short and typically only a,116.7,5.34,122.04,happy
few months in length during that short,119.13,5.43,124.56,happy
life your red blood cells provide a,122.04,4.679,126.71900000000001,happy
record of how much glucose they,124.56,4.83,129.39000000000001,fear
encounter which acts as a good indicator,126.719,4.891,131.60999999999999,happy
of how well you've been controlling your,129.39,3.97,133.35999999999999,happy
blood sugar over time,131.61,4.27,135.88000000000002,happy
and this ability to reveal a picture of,133.36,4.56,137.92000000000002,happy
your average blood sugar over a few,135.88,5.43,141.31,happy
months is what makes the hba1c test,137.92,5.04,142.95999999999998,happy
useful as a screening test for,141.31,3.92,145.23,happy
pre-diabetes and diabetes,142.96,4.74,147.70000000000002,happy
now having red blood cells that are,145.23,4.99,150.22,happy
essentially sugar-coated may sound a bit,147.7,5.01,152.70999999999998,happy
alarming but it's normal to have some,150.22,6.06,156.28,happy
glycation present so your hba1c would,152.71,7.17,159.88,happy
never be 0 according to the National,156.28,6.03,162.31,happy
Institute for Health a person without,159.88,5.72,165.6,
diabetes would have an a1c level below,162.31,6.36,168.67000000000002,
5.7 percent whereas a person with,165.6,6.609,172.209,
diabetes would have an a1c of 6.5 or,168.67,6.539,175.20899999999997,
above and in between these two figures a,172.209,5.551,177.76,
person would be classified as having,175.209,6.091,181.3,
pre-diabetes so you can see that keeping,177.76,6.38,184.14,
your hba1c low is a desirable goal,181.3,4.83,186.13000000000002,happy
unfortunately there are a number of,184.14,4.12,188.26,happy
actions that you can take to naturally,186.13,5.01,191.14,happy
lower your results the best approach is,188.26,5.13,193.39,happy
to reduce the amount of quick digesting,191.14,4.83,195.97,happy
carbohydrates that you're eating when,193.39,5.159,198.54899999999998,
you eat carbohydrates your digestive,195.97,4.739,200.709,
tract breaks them down into glucose,198.549,3.931,202.48000000000002,
which is then transported into your,200.709,3.721,204.43,
blood where the simple sugar comes in,202.48,4.319,206.79899999999998,fear
contact with your red blood cells so you,204.43,4.86,209.29000000000002,fear
want to eat in a way that minimizes,206.799,5.011,211.81,fear
the rush of sugar into your blood and,209.29,5.82,215.10999999999999,happy
that is done by reducing carbs that,211.81,6.39,218.2,happy
break down quickly like sugar and,215.11,5.64,220.75,happy
refined carbs which I refer to as the,218.2,5.849,224.04899999999998,happy
three C's cookies cakes and candies some,220.75,5.25,226.0,happy
carbohydrates like leafy greens non,224.049,3.841,227.89000000000001,happy
starchy vegetables nuts and seeds,226.0,4.5,230.5,happy
contain fiber and nutrients that slow,227.89,4.92,232.80999999999997,happy
their breakdown and absorption so you,230.5,4.38,234.88,surprise
don't need to eliminate all carbs from,232.81,5.209,238.019,happy
your diet just make different choices,234.88,6.3,241.18,happy
exercise is also beneficial because it,238.019,5.171,243.19,
helps your body use the sugar that is,241.18,3.809,244.989,
available by improving insulin,243.19,4.32,247.51,
sensitivity when your cells are more,244.989,4.831,249.82,
insulin sensitive they have an easier,247.51,4.74,252.25,happy
time pulling sugar out of your blood so,249.82,5.13,254.95,happy
there is less circulating and the,252.25,4.799,257.049,happy
exercise does not have to be exhausting,254.95,4.74,259.69,happy
to be helpful even short brisk walks,257.049,5.161,262.21,happy
after dinner can move you into a,259.69,5.64,265.33,happy
positive direction these lifestyle,262.21,4.69,266.9,fear
changes when done consist,265.33,3.49,268.82,sad
can result in weight loss which is,266.9,3.78,270.67999999999995,sad
another way you can bring down your,268.82,5.58,274.4,happy
hba1c naturally in fact the effects of,270.68,5.34,276.02,happy
weight loss can be dramatic,274.4,4.53,278.92999999999995,
this study followed 522 middle-aged,276.02,5.28,281.29999999999995,
overweight men and women for more than,278.93,4.44,283.37,
three years during the study the,281.3,4.29,285.59000000000003,
subjects were split into an intervention,283.37,4.44,287.81,
group that was given help losing weight,285.59,5.28,290.86999999999995,
and a control group due to the lifestyle,287.81,5.37,293.18,
changes that resulted in weight loss the,290.87,4.56,295.43,
risk of diabetes was reduced by 58,293.18,5.459,298.639,
percent in the intervention group so,295.43,5.43,300.86,happy
lifestyle choices will make a difference,298.639,5.461,304.1,happy
in your hba1c level which is good news,300.86,5.66,306.52000000000004,happy
because that means you have some control,304.1,5.28,309.38,happy
however the changes will take time which,306.52,5.38,311.9,happy
requires you to create a plan that is,309.38,5.34,314.71999999999997,happy
easy to follow enjoyable and effective,311.9,5.61,317.51,happy
those are my three e's and they are the,314.72,4.74,319.46000000000004,happy
overarching goal of my freedom health,317.51,4.379,321.889,happy
