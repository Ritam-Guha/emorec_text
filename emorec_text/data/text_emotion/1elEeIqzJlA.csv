hba1c is a blood test that shows how well you are controlling your blood sugar over time it does this by taking a look at how much sugar is attached to your red blood cells the more sugar that,0.0,22.950000000000003,22.950000000000003,sad
is attached the higher your hba1c in this video we'll take a look at how this test works and ways to keep your results in the healthy range hba1c goes by different names so you might hear it,11.4,32.040000000000006,43.440000000000005,sad
referred to as simply the a1c test the hemoglobin a1c test or the glycated hemoglobin test and while this last name is the most complex it does the best job of explaining what the test measures,26.97,27.689999999999998,54.66,sad
which is the amount of sugar or glucose that is sticking to a specific protein in your red blood cells called hemoglobin the process of glucose binding to hemoglobin is called,41.25,23.970000000000002,65.22,sad
glycation hence the name the glycated hemoglobin test your red blood cells are great targets for this test because of their unique structure and how they use glucose to survive red blood cells are,53.37,25.859,79.229,sad
plentiful in your bloodstream and their primary job is to carry oxygen around your body and they take their job very seriously so we see that as red blood cells mature they fill up with more and,66.51,25.498999999999995,92.009,NA
more hemoglobin which is the protein that actually carries the oxygen but this accumulation of hemoglobin makes things very cramped inside the cells so to make room mature red blood cells,79.229,23.521,102.75,sad
sacrifice their mitochondria mitochondria are the powerhouses that the majority of your cells rely on to make energy without these powerhouses your red blood cells must get their,91.049,22.89,113.93900000000001,sad
energy through a much less efficient process that involves the fermentation of glucose and while this process works it wears the cells out quickly so the average lifespan of a red blood cell is,102.57,28.680999999999997,131.25099999999998,sad
relatively short and typically only a few months in length during that short life your red blood cells provide a record of how much glucose they encounter which acts as a good indicator,116.7,25.17,141.87,sad
of how well you've been controlling your blood sugar over time and this ability to reveal a picture of your average blood sugar over a few months is what makes the hba1c test,129.39,23.27,152.66,sad
useful as a screening test for pre-diabetes and diabetes now having red blood cells that are essentially sugar-coated may sound a bit alarming but it's normal to have some,141.31,24.72,166.03,sad
glycation present so your hba1c would never be 0 according to the National Institute for Health a person without diabetes would have an a1c level below 5.7 percent whereas a person with,152.71,31.888999999999996,184.599,sad
diabetes would have an a1c of 6.5 or above and in between these two figures a person would be classified as having pre-diabetes so you can see that keeping your hba1c low is a desirable goal,168.67,29.391,198.06099999999998,sad
unfortunately there are a number of actions that you can take to naturally lower your results the best approach is to reduce the amount of quick digesting carbohydrates that you're eating when,184.14,24.248999999999995,208.38899999999998,sad
you eat carbohydrates your digestive tract breaks them down into glucose which is then transported into your blood where the simple sugar comes in contact with your red blood cells so you,195.97,21.57,217.54,sad
want to eat in a way that minimizes the rush of sugar into your blood and that is done by reducing carbs that break down quickly like sugar and refined carbs which I refer to as the,206.799,28.71,235.50900000000001,sad
three C's cookies cakes and candies some carbohydrates like leafy greens non starchy vegetables nuts and seeds contain fiber and nutrients that slow their breakdown and absorption so you,220.75,22.891000000000002,243.641,sad
don't need to eliminate all carbs from your diet just make different choices exercise is also beneficial because it helps your body use the sugar that is available by improving insulin,232.81,24.809,257.619,sad
sensitivity when your cells are more insulin sensitive they have an easier time pulling sugar out of your blood so there is less circulating and the exercise does not have to be exhausting,244.989,24.240000000000002,269.229,sad
to be helpful even short brisk walks after dinner can move you into a positive direction these lifestyle changes when done consist can result in weight loss which is,257.049,22.761000000000003,279.81,sad
another way you can bring down your hba1c naturally in fact the effects of weight loss can be dramatic this study followed 522 middle-aged overweight men and women for more than,268.82,25.17,293.99,sad
three years during the study the subjects were split into an intervention group that was given help losing weight and a control group due to the lifestyle changes that resulted in weight loss the,281.3,23.94,305.24,sad
risk of diabetes was reduced by 58 percent in the intervention group so lifestyle choices will make a difference in your hba1c level which is good news because that means you have some control,293.18,27.290000000000003,320.47,sad
however the changes will take time which requires you to create a plan that is easy to follow enjoyable and effective those are my three e's and they are the overarching goal of my freedom health,306.52,25.448999999999998,331.969,sad
