"At our Pancreas Clinic, of course our focus
is any patient with any type of pancreas disease. In my area of interest and research and my
focus on chronic pancreatitis, the patients we want to focus on are patients who are suspected
of having the disease so we can make the appropriate diagnosis, prevent any kind of invasive and
potentially damaging procedures in patients who do not have the diagnosis and in those
that do, start offering different treatment",0.34,24.64,24.98,fear

we hope to prevent the development of diabetes, which is otherwise inevitable if you just

proactive; need to find that there are many other people who are studying this to try
