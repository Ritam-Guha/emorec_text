hey guys in this video I want to bring,0.03,4.71,4.74,neutral
up a question what is worse having high,1.829,6.541,8.370000000000001,neutral
insulin or having high glucose type down,4.74,7.109,11.849,neutral
below what you think is worse okay let's,8.37,5.729,14.099,fear
just talk about it so the first thing to,11.849,5.701,17.55,fear
occur in the chain of events is high,14.099,5.731,19.83,neutral
insulin okay then a person develops,17.55,5.51,23.060000000000002,neutral
insulin resistance which is pre-diabetes,19.83,5.959,25.788999999999998,fear
then eventually they'll develop,23.06,6.0,29.06,fear
hyperglycemia which is high sugar hyper,25.789,5.951,31.740000000000002,surprise
glycaemia is high amounts of sugar which,29.06,6.7,35.76,surprise
is now diagnosed as diabetes but in this,31.74,6.06,37.8,fear
process right here if their adrenals are,35.76,5.15,40.91,fear
weak okay they can actually develop,37.8,5.61,43.41,fear
hypoglycemia because the high amounts of,40.91,4.48,45.39,NA
insulin is driving down the sugar and,43.41,5.43,48.839999999999996,fear
the body doesn't have the kind of the,45.39,5.759,51.149,fear
buffering the neutralization of the low,48.84,4.05,52.89,fear
blood sugar like the adrenals supposed,51.149,3.721,54.870000000000005,fear
to release sugar and the liver to kind,52.89,3.27,56.160000000000004,fear
of stabilize the blood sugar so if,54.87,2.91,57.78,NA
there's problems with the adrenal the,56.16,3.84,60.0,fear
person will first have hypoglycemic low,57.78,4.82,62.6,fear
blood sugar symptoms before they get,60.0,7.17,67.17,neutral
hyperglycemia a high sugar so high,62.6,7.269,69.869,NA
amounts of insulin has direct side,67.17,3.96,71.13,NA
effects which we're going to talk about,69.869,4.141,74.01,NA
an indirect side effects depending,71.13,5.52,76.64999999999999,NA
what's happening with hypoglycemia or,74.01,7.469,81.479,fear
hyperglycemia okay so the direct side,76.65,6.39,83.04,fear
effects from having high amounts of,81.479,4.261,85.74,fear
insulin be cardiac hypertrophy where the,83.04,5.009,88.049,fear
cells of the heart actually get bigger,85.74,4.559,90.29899999999999,fear
like in cardiomegaly where the heart,88.049,3.96,92.009,neutral
doesn't fit into the chest cabin anymore,90.299,3.21,93.509,neutral
that creates a lot of problems with the,92.009,3.661,95.67,fear
with the vessels and the valves and the,93.509,4.801,98.31,fear
the actual work of the heart and the,95.67,4.199,99.869,fear
function of the heart thrombus which is,98.31,3.9,102.21000000000001,NA
a clot so when you have too much insulin,99.869,5.28,105.149,fear
it really targets the large arteries to,102.21,5.519,107.729,fear
the heart especially the wall of the,105.149,5.97,111.119,fear
heart and it makes it stiff it actually,107.729,6.18,113.90899999999999,neutral
creates lesions it creates problems with,111.119,5.941,117.06,fear
plaquing creates obstruction and,113.909,4.801,118.71000000000001,fear
eventually will develop a clot it can,117.06,3.12,120.18,NA
actually turn to a stroke or just have a,118.71,3.479,122.189,NA
heart attack so high insulin is behind,120.18,6.06,126.24000000000001,NA
most all inflammatory conditions turns,122.189,5.701,127.88999999999999,NA
into diabetes causing the fatty liver,126.24,5.31,131.54999999999998,NA
makes you fat and obesity causes the,127.89,5.01,132.9,NA
cancer I'm going to put some links down,131.55,2.16,133.71,NA
below,132.9,2.77,135.67000000000002,NA
Alzheimer's because it affects the,133.71,3.34,137.05,NA
dimension and plaquing of the brain,135.67,3.75,139.42,NA
amyloid plaque II metabolic syndrome,137.05,3.57,140.62,NA
which is a combination of some of these,139.42,3.24,142.66,fear
we just talked about the ret now that's,140.62,6.15,146.77,fear
the I nerve damage and kidney damage,142.66,6.51,149.17,fear
other than that it's totally fine now,146.77,5.94,152.71,fear
when you have diabetes type 1 which you,149.17,5.73,154.89999999999998,NA
don't produce insulin anymore so,152.71,4.62,157.33,fear
diabetics type 1 still have high insulin,154.9,4.92,159.82,fear
because they're being given insulin,157.33,4.35,161.68,fear
through an injection the ultimate goal,159.82,3.48,163.29999999999998,fear
would be to decrease the amount of,161.68,3.45,165.13,fear
insulin that your body uses so if you're,163.3,3.69,166.99,fear
diabetic and you're on medication the,165.13,3.33,168.46,fear
goal would be to take the least amount,166.99,3.75,170.74,fear
possible if you're not a diabetic,168.46,4.32,172.78,fear
is to eliminate the foods that are,170.74,4.2,174.94,fear
triggering insulin so I put a link down,172.78,4.59,177.37,NA
below exactly how to do that thanks for,174.94,3.53,178.47,neutral
