hey guys in this video I want to bring up a question what is worse having high insulin or having high glucose type down below what you think is worse okay let's just talk about it so the first thing to,0.03,29.79,29.82,sad
occur in the chain of events is high insulin okay then a person develops insulin resistance which is pre-diabetes then eventually they'll develop hyperglycemia which is high sugar hyper,14.099,29.151,43.25,sad
glycaemia is high amounts of sugar which is now diagnosed as diabetes but in this process right here if their adrenals are weak okay they can actually develop hypoglycemia because the high amounts of,29.06,28.0,57.06,angry
insulin is driving down the sugar and the body doesn't have the kind of the buffering the neutralization of the low blood sugar like the adrenals supposed to release sugar and the liver to kind,43.41,22.23,65.64,NA
of stabilize the blood sugar so if there's problems with the adrenal the person will first have hypoglycemic low blood sugar symptoms before they get hyperglycemia a high sugar so high,54.87,26.009,80.87899999999999,sad
amounts of insulin has direct side effects which we're going to talk about an indirect side effects depending what's happening with hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia okay so the direct side,67.17,27.48,94.65,sad
effects from having high amounts of insulin be cardiac hypertrophy where the cells of the heart actually get bigger like in cardiomegaly where the heart doesn't fit into the chest cabin anymore,81.479,20.999000000000002,102.47800000000001,sad
that creates a lot of problems with the with the vessels and the valves and the the actual work of the heart and the function of the heart thrombus which is a clot so when you have too much insulin,92.009,21.841,113.85,sad
it really targets the large arteries to the heart especially the wall of the heart and it makes it stiff it actually creates lesions it creates problems with plaquing creates obstruction and,102.21,28.411,130.62099999999998,sad
eventually will develop a clot it can actually turn to a stroke or just have a heart attack so high insulin is behind most all inflammatory conditions turns into diabetes causing the fatty liver,117.06,23.669999999999998,140.73,sad
makes you fat and obesity causes the cancer I'm going to put some links down below Alzheimer's because it affects the dimension and plaquing of the brain,127.89,17.03,144.92000000000002,sad
amyloid plaque II metabolic syndrome which is a combination of some of these we just talked about the ret now that's the I nerve damage and kidney damage other than that it's totally fine now,137.05,25.41,162.46,sad
when you have diabetes type 1 which you don't produce insulin anymore so diabetics type 1 still have high insulin because they're being given insulin through an injection the ultimate goal,149.17,23.1,172.26999999999998,sad
would be to decrease the amount of insulin that your body uses so if you're diabetic and you're on medication the goal would be to take the least amount possible if you're not a diabetic,161.68,18.54,180.22,sad
is to eliminate the foods that are triggering insulin so I put a link down below exactly how to do that thanks for watching press the subscribe button forgot the,170.74,24.299999999999997,195.04000000000002,sad
last part and I'm going to see you next time am I gonna I will press up and yeah you'll get future updates that's right updates I knew there was a word what's the last part what should I say how,182.74,31.86,214.60000000000002,sad
