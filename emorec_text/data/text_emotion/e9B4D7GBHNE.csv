hey guys in this video I want to bring,0.03,4.71,4.74,
up a question what is worse having high,1.829,6.541,8.370000000000001,
insulin or having high glucose type down,4.74,7.109,11.849,
below what you think is worse okay let's,8.37,5.729,14.099,
just talk about it so the first thing to,11.849,5.701,17.55,
occur in the chain of events is high,14.099,5.731,19.83,
insulin okay then a person develops,17.55,5.51,23.060000000000002,
insulin resistance which is pre-diabetes,19.83,5.959,25.788999999999998,
then eventually they'll develop,23.06,6.0,29.06,
hyperglycemia which is high sugar hyper,25.789,5.951,31.740000000000002,
glycaemia is high amounts of sugar which,29.06,6.7,35.76,
is now diagnosed as diabetes but in this,31.74,6.06,37.8,
process right here if their adrenals are,35.76,5.15,40.91,
weak okay they can actually develop,37.8,5.61,43.41,
hypoglycemia because the high amounts of,40.91,4.48,45.39,
insulin is driving down the sugar and,43.41,5.43,48.839999999999996,
the body doesn't have the kind of the,45.39,5.759,51.149,
buffering the neutralization of the low,48.84,4.05,52.89,surprise
blood sugar like the adrenals supposed,51.149,3.721,54.870000000000005,
to release sugar and the liver to kind,52.89,3.27,56.160000000000004,
of stabilize the blood sugar so if,54.87,2.91,57.78,
there's problems with the adrenal the,56.16,3.84,60.0,
person will first have hypoglycemic low,57.78,4.82,62.6,
blood sugar symptoms before they get,60.0,7.17,67.17,
hyperglycemia a high sugar so high,62.6,7.269,69.869,
amounts of insulin has direct side,67.17,3.96,71.13,
effects which we're going to talk about,69.869,4.141,74.01,
an indirect side effects depending,71.13,5.52,76.64999999999999,
what's happening with hypoglycemia or,74.01,7.469,81.479,
hyperglycemia okay so the direct side,76.65,6.39,83.04,
effects from having high amounts of,81.479,4.261,85.74,
insulin be cardiac hypertrophy where the,83.04,5.009,88.049,
cells of the heart actually get bigger,85.74,4.559,90.29899999999999,surprise
like in cardiomegaly where the heart,88.049,3.96,92.009,
doesn't fit into the chest cabin anymore,90.299,3.21,93.509,
that creates a lot of problems with the,92.009,3.661,95.67,
with the vessels and the valves and the,93.509,4.801,98.31,
the actual work of the heart and the,95.67,4.199,99.869,
function of the heart thrombus which is,98.31,3.9,102.21000000000001,
a clot so when you have too much insulin,99.869,5.28,105.149,
it really targets the large arteries to,102.21,5.519,107.729,
the heart especially the wall of the,105.149,5.97,111.119,
heart and it makes it stiff it actually,107.729,6.18,113.90899999999999,
creates lesions it creates problems with,111.119,5.941,117.06,
plaquing creates obstruction and,113.909,4.801,118.71000000000001,
eventually will develop a clot it can,117.06,3.12,120.18,
actually turn to a stroke or just have a,118.71,3.479,122.189,
heart attack so high insulin is behind,120.18,6.06,126.24000000000001,
most all inflammatory conditions turns,122.189,5.701,127.88999999999999,
into diabetes causing the fatty liver,126.24,5.31,131.54999999999998,
makes you fat and obesity causes the,127.89,5.01,132.9,
cancer I'm going to put some links down,131.55,2.16,133.71,
below,132.9,2.77,135.67000000000002,
Alzheimer's because it affects the,133.71,3.34,137.05,
dimension and plaquing of the brain,135.67,3.75,139.42,
amyloid plaque II metabolic syndrome,137.05,3.57,140.62,
which is a combination of some of these,139.42,3.24,142.66,
we just talked about the ret now that's,140.62,6.15,146.77,
the I nerve damage and kidney damage,142.66,6.51,149.17,
other than that it's totally fine now,146.77,5.94,152.71,
when you have diabetes type 1 which you,149.17,5.73,154.89999999999998,
don't produce insulin anymore so,152.71,4.62,157.33,fear
diabetics type 1 still have high insulin,154.9,4.92,159.82,
because they're being given insulin,157.33,4.35,161.68,
through an injection the ultimate goal,159.82,3.48,163.29999999999998,fear
would be to decrease the amount of,161.68,3.45,165.13,fear
insulin that your body uses so if you're,163.3,3.69,166.99,fear
diabetic and you're on medication the,165.13,3.33,168.46,fear
goal would be to take the least amount,166.99,3.75,170.74,fear
possible if you're not a diabetic,168.46,4.32,172.78,
is to eliminate the foods that are,170.74,4.2,174.94,
triggering insulin so I put a link down,172.78,4.59,177.37,
below exactly how to do that thanks for,174.94,3.53,178.47,happy
