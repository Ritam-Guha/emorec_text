polycystic ovaries is sort of a,3.49,7.63,11.120000000000001,sad
multi-symptom disease process and I,7.729,5.551,13.280000000000001,sad
think for for many years was was very,11.12,7.44,18.56,sad
misunderstood or under diagnosed the,13.28,6.72,20.0,sad
most common symptom of polycystic,18.56,5.1,23.659999999999997,sad
ovaries is irregular periods patients,20.0,6.41,26.41,sad
will skip periods for months at a time,23.66,8.16,31.82,sad
or weeks you know go into 45 days beyond,26.41,7.81,34.22,sad
45 days 3 months 6 months at a time,31.82,5.22,37.04,sad
they'll skip periods and then when they,34.22,6.96,41.18,sad
have them they can be fairly heavy it's,37.04,6.24,43.28,sad
also a disease process where we think,41.18,4.92,46.1,sad
insulin resistance um plays a role we,43.28,6.95,50.230000000000004,sad
see some abnormal hair growth we see,46.1,7.2,53.300000000000004,sad
some skin changes associated with it we,50.23,5.649,55.879,sad
see acne so there's a variety of,53.3,5.43,58.73,sad
different symptoms that that can present,55.879,6.241,62.12,sad
that might patient off to recognizing,58.73,5.539,64.26899999999999,sad
that maybe there's a problem here,62.12,5.64,67.75999999999999,sad
certainly if if you're not ovulating and,64.269,6.311,70.58000000000001,sad
triggering a period then it also can be,67.76,5.22,72.98,sad
difficult to attain a pregnancy because,70.58,5.07,75.65,sad
you certainly have less opportunities in,72.98,6.23,79.21000000000001,sad
a year's time period to to get pregnant,75.65,7.59,83.24000000000001,sad
and it's estimated right now that,79.21,5.89,85.1,sad
upwards of 15 percent of women in the,83.24,5.64,88.88,sad
United States probably have some variety,85.1,6.51,91.61,fear
of polycystic ovaries it's a large,88.88,4.86,93.74,sad
number and I think that's consistent,91.61,4.86,96.47,sad
with what I see in my practice for the,93.74,5.82,99.56,sad
most part you know polycystic ovaries is,96.47,5.88,102.35,sad
not dangerous to people um it's a,99.56,5.03,104.59,sad
problem that needs to be simply managed,102.35,5.58,107.92999999999999,sad
so if people have irregular periods and,104.59,6.13,110.72,sad
have some of these other symptoms they,107.93,5.7,113.63000000000001,sad
should see their gynecologist and have a,110.72,5.31,116.03,sad
discussion about trying to determine,113.63,5.61,119.24,sad
what is the cause of their irregular,116.03,6.6,122.63,sad
periods kind of the old adage that oh I,119.24,5.07,124.31,sad
didn't get my period I must have been,122.63,4.23,126.86,sad
stressed is really not an accurate,124.31,4.35,128.66,neutral
assessment of,126.86,4.17,131.03,sad
people's problems and so if people are,128.66,5.46,134.12,sad
regularly skipping periods they should,131.03,4.83,135.86,sad
be seen by a physician they should be,134.12,4.95,139.07,sad
evaluated because if left untreated over,135.86,5.13,140.99,sad
years and years it is a problem that,139.07,4.5,143.57,sad
that can give people some issues down,140.99,6.3,147.29000000000002,sad
the road such as you know premature,143.57,6.42,149.98999999999998,sad
coronary disease it can cause you know,147.29,6.18,153.47,sad
diabetes or not cause diabetes but it,149.99,7.2,157.19,sad
can be a pre pre symptom to someone who,153.47,6.66,160.13,sad
may develop diabetes and and certainly,157.19,6.27,163.46,sad
in a material cancer if people go years,160.13,6.39,166.51999999999998,sad
and years and years without regulation,163.46,5.07,168.53,sad
of their cycles um it can promote the,166.52,4.32,170.84,sad
risk of endometrial cancer and so it is,168.53,4.47,173.0,sad
a problem that should be managed it,170.84,4.41,175.25,sad
should be evaluated and then a,173.0,3.75,176.75,sad
discussion and understanding of the,175.25,3.15,178.4,sad
disease process between the patient and,176.75,4.31,181.06,sad
the physician the treatment really is,178.4,6.96,185.36,sad
management of the ill effects of the,181.06,7.93,188.99,sad
disease process so if one of the,185.36,7.32,192.68,sad
problems is that I have some insulin,188.99,6.6,195.59,sad
resistance then certainly changing diet,192.68,8.61,201.29000000000002,sad
and exercise and weight loss can prolong,195.59,8.369,203.959,sad
or decrease the chance that someone,201.29,5.64,206.92999999999998,sad
might develop diabetes down the road the,203.959,4.951,208.91,fear
regulation of the cycles through a,206.93,6.93,213.86,sad
variety of medications can prevent the,208.91,8.549,217.459,sad
risk of endometrial cancer over time and,213.86,7.28,221.14000000000001,sad
so the treatments don't fix the problem,217.459,6.571,224.03,sad
necessarily the treatments really are,221.14,6.58,227.72,sad
designed to manage the problem so that,224.03,6.69,230.72,sad
people don't have long term ill effects,227.72,6.18,233.9,sad
of it the the easiest and best way to,230.72,5.22,235.94,sad
probably try to reverse some of the,233.9,4.2,238.1,sad
effects of polycystic ovaries is through,235.94,5.15,241.09,sad
good diet and weight loss,238.1,2.99,241.09,fear
