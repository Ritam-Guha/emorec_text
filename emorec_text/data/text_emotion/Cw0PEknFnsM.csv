have them they can be fairly heavy it's also a disease process where we think insulin resistance um plays a role we see some abnormal hair growth we see some skin changes associated with it we,37.04,30.959,67.999,angry
see acne so there's a variety of different symptoms that that can present that might patient off to recognizing that maybe there's a problem here certainly if if you're not ovulating and,53.3,29.161,82.461,angry
triggering a period then it also can be difficult to attain a pregnancy because you certainly have less opportunities in a year's time period to to get pregnant and it's estimated right now that,67.76,30.0,97.76,angry

stressed is really not an accurate assessment of people's problems and so if people are regularly skipping periods they should be seen by a physician they should be,124.31,23.76,148.07,angry
evaluated because if left untreated over years and years it is a problem that that can give people some issues down the road such as you know premature coronary disease it can cause you know,135.86,28.53,164.39000000000001,angry
