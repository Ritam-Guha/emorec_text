polycystic ovaries is sort of a,3.49,7.63,11.120000000000001,fear
multi-symptom disease process and I,7.729,5.551,13.280000000000001,fear
think for for many years was was very,11.12,7.44,18.56,fear
misunderstood or under diagnosed the,13.28,6.72,20.0,fear
most common symptom of polycystic,18.56,5.1,23.659999999999997,fear
ovaries is irregular periods patients,20.0,6.41,26.41,fear
will skip periods for months at a time,23.66,8.16,31.82,fear
or weeks you know go into 45 days beyond,26.41,7.81,34.22,fear
45 days 3 months 6 months at a time,31.82,5.22,37.04,happy
they'll skip periods and then when they,34.22,6.96,41.18,angry
have them they can be fairly heavy it's,37.04,6.24,43.28,neutral
also a disease process where we think,41.18,4.92,46.1,sad
insulin resistance um plays a role we,43.28,6.95,50.230000000000004,fear
see some abnormal hair growth we see,46.1,7.2,53.300000000000004,fear
some skin changes associated with it we,50.23,5.649,55.879,fear
see acne so there's a variety of,53.3,5.43,58.73,fear
different symptoms that that can present,55.879,6.241,62.12,fear
that might patient off to recognizing,58.73,5.539,64.26899999999999,fear
that maybe there's a problem here,62.12,5.64,67.75999999999999,fear
certainly if if you're not ovulating and,64.269,6.311,70.58000000000001,fear
triggering a period then it also can be,67.76,5.22,72.98,sad
difficult to attain a pregnancy because,70.58,5.07,75.65,fear
you certainly have less opportunities in,72.98,6.23,79.21000000000001,fear
a year's time period to to get pregnant,75.65,7.59,83.24000000000001,fear
and it's estimated right now that,79.21,5.89,85.1,fear
upwards of 15 percent of women in the,83.24,5.64,88.88,fear
United States probably have some variety,85.1,6.51,91.61,fear
of polycystic ovaries it's a large,88.88,4.86,93.74,fear
number and I think that's consistent,91.61,4.86,96.47,fear
with what I see in my practice for the,93.74,5.82,99.56,fear
most part you know polycystic ovaries is,96.47,5.88,102.35,fear
not dangerous to people um it's a,99.56,5.03,104.59,fear
problem that needs to be simply managed,102.35,5.58,107.92999999999999,fear
so if people have irregular periods and,104.59,6.13,110.72,sad
have some of these other symptoms they,107.93,5.7,113.63000000000001,sad
should see their gynecologist and have a,110.72,5.31,116.03,sad
discussion about trying to determine,113.63,5.61,119.24,fear
what is the cause of their irregular,116.03,6.6,122.63,fear
periods kind of the old adage that oh I,119.24,5.07,124.31,sad
didn't get my period I must have been,122.63,4.23,126.86,sad
stressed is really not an accurate,124.31,4.35,128.66,happy
assessment of,126.86,4.17,131.03,sad
people's problems and so if people are,128.66,5.46,134.12,sad
regularly skipping periods they should,131.03,4.83,135.86,fear
be seen by a physician they should be,134.12,4.95,139.07,fear
evaluated because if left untreated over,135.86,5.13,140.99,fear
years and years it is a problem that,139.07,4.5,143.57,fear
that can give people some issues down,140.99,6.3,147.29000000000002,fear
the road such as you know premature,143.57,6.42,149.98999999999998,sad
coronary disease it can cause you know,147.29,6.18,153.47,sad
diabetes or not cause diabetes but it,149.99,7.2,157.19,fear
can be a pre pre symptom to someone who,153.47,6.66,160.13,fear
may develop diabetes and and certainly,157.19,6.27,163.46,sad
in a material cancer if people go years,160.13,6.39,166.51999999999998,fear
and years and years without regulation,163.46,5.07,168.53,fear
of their cycles um it can promote the,166.52,4.32,170.84,sad
risk of endometrial cancer and so it is,168.53,4.47,173.0,sad
a problem that should be managed it,170.84,4.41,175.25,sad
should be evaluated and then a,173.0,3.75,176.75,fear
discussion and understanding of the,175.25,3.15,178.4,fear
disease process between the patient and,176.75,4.31,181.06,fear
the physician the treatment really is,178.4,6.96,185.36,fear
management of the ill effects of the,181.06,7.93,188.99,fear
disease process so if one of the,185.36,7.32,192.68,fear
problems is that I have some insulin,188.99,6.6,195.59,fear
resistance then certainly changing diet,192.68,8.61,201.29000000000002,fear
and exercise and weight loss can prolong,195.59,8.369,203.959,fear
or decrease the chance that someone,201.29,5.64,206.92999999999998,fear
might develop diabetes down the road the,203.959,4.951,208.91,fear
regulation of the cycles through a,206.93,6.93,213.86,fear
variety of medications can prevent the,208.91,8.549,217.459,fear
risk of endometrial cancer over time and,213.86,7.28,221.14000000000001,fear
so the treatments don't fix the problem,217.459,6.571,224.03,fear
necessarily the treatments really are,221.14,6.58,227.72,sad
designed to manage the problem so that,224.03,6.69,230.72,sad
people don't have long term ill effects,227.72,6.18,233.9,sad
of it the the easiest and best way to,230.72,5.22,235.94,sad
probably try to reverse some of the,233.9,4.2,238.1,fear
effects of polycystic ovaries is through,235.94,5.15,241.09,fear
good diet and weight loss,238.1,2.99,241.09,fear
