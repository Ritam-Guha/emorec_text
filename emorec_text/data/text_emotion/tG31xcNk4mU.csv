this video will show you how to inject,5.2,3.68,8.88,happy
insulin safely,7.2,3.519,10.719000000000001,happy
it's important to remember that people,8.88,4.0,12.88,happy
will take different types of insulin at,10.719,4.241,14.959999999999999,happy
different times and different amounts,12.88,4.319,17.199,fear
during the day and that's decided in,14.96,5.2,20.16,fear
conjunction with your healthcare team,17.199,5.121,22.32,fear
insulin is injected just under the skin,20.16,5.52,25.68,fear
it doesn't go deep into a muscle or vein,22.32,6.4,28.72,fear
the main sites for injecting insulin are,25.68,6.08,31.759999999999998,fear
your stomach so that's in a semicircle,28.72,5.519,34.239,fear
underneath your belly button,31.76,5.12,36.88,
your thighs the front,34.239,5.041,39.28,
or the side,36.88,4.72,41.6,
and your buttocks,39.28,4.32,43.6,
some people might also inject in their,41.6,5.6,47.2,
arms so that's not always recommended,43.6,5.52,49.120000000000005,fear
it's really important that you rotate,47.2,4.16,51.36,fear
the place that you do your injection and,49.12,4.72,53.839999999999996,fear
all of those sites have quite a quite a,51.36,4.56,55.92,fear
wide surface area so it's important that,53.84,4.239,58.079,neutral
you choose a different spot within each,55.92,3.84,59.760000000000005,neutral
site,58.079,4.32,62.399,sad
injecting too often into the same place,59.76,4.479,64.239,sad
will cause hard lumps to appear under,62.399,5.361,67.76,sad
the skin that's called lipo hypertrophy,64.239,5.361,69.60000000000001,sad
the lumps can stop the insulin being,67.76,3.679,71.43900000000001,sad
absorbed properly and that will mean,69.6,3.519,73.119,sad
