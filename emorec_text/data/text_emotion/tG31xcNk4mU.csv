hello i'm libby dowling clinical advisor,1.199,4.001,5.2,sad
at diabetes uk,3.439,3.761,7.2,sad
this video will show you how to inject,5.2,3.68,8.88,sad
insulin safely,7.2,3.519,10.719000000000001,sad
it's important to remember that people,8.88,4.0,12.88,sad
will take different types of insulin at,10.719,4.241,14.959999999999999,sad
different times and different amounts,12.88,4.319,17.199,sad
during the day and that's decided in,14.96,5.2,20.16,sad
conjunction with your healthcare team,17.199,5.121,22.32,sad
insulin is injected just under the skin,20.16,5.52,25.68,sad
it doesn't go deep into a muscle or vein,22.32,6.4,28.72,sad
the main sites for injecting insulin are,25.68,6.08,31.759999999999998,sad
your stomach so that's in a semicircle,28.72,5.519,34.239,sad
underneath your belly button,31.76,5.12,36.88,NA
your thighs the front,34.239,5.041,39.28,NA
or the side,36.88,4.72,41.6,NA
and your buttocks,39.28,4.32,43.6,NA
some people might also inject in their,41.6,5.6,47.2,sad
arms so that's not always recommended,43.6,5.52,49.120000000000005,sad
it's really important that you rotate,47.2,4.16,51.36,sad
the place that you do your injection and,49.12,4.72,53.839999999999996,sad
all of those sites have quite a quite a,51.36,4.56,55.92,sad
wide surface area so it's important that,53.84,4.239,58.079,sad
you choose a different spot within each,55.92,3.84,59.760000000000005,sad
site,58.079,4.32,62.399,sad
injecting too often into the same place,59.76,4.479,64.239,sad
will cause hard lumps to appear under,62.399,5.361,67.76,sad
the skin that's called lipo hypertrophy,64.239,5.361,69.60000000000001,sad
the lumps can stop the insulin being,67.76,3.679,71.43900000000001,sad
absorbed properly and that will mean,69.6,3.519,73.119,sad
that your diabetes won't be as well,71.439,3.441,74.88,sad
managed as it might be,73.119,4.32,77.439,sad
a typical injecting kit consists of an,74.88,3.84,78.72,sad
insulin pen,77.439,5.121,82.55999999999999,NA
which might be a reusable one,78.72,3.84,82.56,NA
or a disposable one,82.96,5.12,88.08,NA
in a disposable pen the insulin comes as,85.28,4.8,90.08,NA
an integral part of it,88.08,4.48,92.56,NA
in a reusable pen you will need to fit,90.08,5.52,95.6,NA
an insulin cartridge separately,92.56,5.68,98.24000000000001,NA
there will also be a needle that fits on,95.6,7.12,102.72,NA
to the end of the pen like that,98.24,4.48,102.72,NA
it's really important that you dispose,103.119,4.481,107.6,sad
of all the sharps very very safely for,104.799,5.521,110.32000000000001,sad
that you can either use a needle clipper,107.6,4.64,112.24,NA
which clips off the sharp point of the,110.32,5.2,115.52,NA
needle and stores it safely inside,112.24,5.199,117.439,NA
and there's also a sharp spin,115.52,3.36,118.88,NA
where you can throw the entire needle,117.439,3.36,120.79899999999999,NA
away,118.88,3.76,122.64,NA
all of these items are available on,120.799,5.201,126.0,NA

insulin should appear at the tip of the,147.84,3.2,151.04,NA
needle,149.76,2.479,152.239,NA
if not,151.04,4.72,155.76,NA

turn the knob until you see the correct,158.48,3.119,161.599,NA

and insert the pen at a 90 degree angle,171.2,7.44,178.64,NA
gently push down on the plunger until,176.08,6.0,182.08,NA
the pen goes back to zero,178.64,6.08,184.72,NA
count to ten slowly,182.08,5.519,187.59900000000002,NA
pull the needle slowly out of the skin,184.72,6.56,191.28,NA
and release the skin fold,187.599,6.241,193.83999999999997,NA
take the needle off the end of the pen,191.28,6.72,198.0,NA
and dispose of it safely in a sharp spin,193.84,5.759,199.599,NA
