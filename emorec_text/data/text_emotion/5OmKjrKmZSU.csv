pre and post meal blood glucose testing,0.56,4.48,5.040000000000001,happy
is a way of being able to judge the,3.439,3.36,6.7989999999999995,fear
effect of meals on your blood sugar,5.04,3.28,8.32,fear
levels,6.799,3.92,10.719000000000001,fear
the benefits of pre and post meal blood,8.32,4.72,13.04,fear
glucose testing include,10.719,4.08,14.799,fear
helping you to see how certain foods,13.04,4.159,17.198999999999998,fear
affect your blood sugar levels,14.799,4.32,19.119,fear
showing you how long certain foods take,17.199,4.16,21.359,happy
to affect your blood sugar levels and if,19.119,3.761,22.88,happy
you're on insulin,21.359,4.881,26.240000000000002,
helping you to judge your insulin doses,22.88,6.799,29.679,
pre and post meal testing involves,26.24,5.52,31.759999999999998,
performing a blood glucose test before,29.679,3.521,33.199999999999996,happy
starting a meal,31.76,3.36,35.120000000000005,happy
performing another test two hours after,33.2,3.44,36.64,happy
starting the meal,35.12,3.599,38.718999999999994,happy
performing a third test four hours after,36.64,3.599,40.239000000000004,happy
eating,38.719,3.441,42.160000000000004,happy
in most cases you should find that blood,40.239,4.0,44.239,happy
glucose results are higher after two,42.16,3.68,45.839999999999996,
hours than they were before eating the,44.239,3.681,47.919999999999995,
meal you should be looking to see how,45.84,4.0,49.84,
much your blood glucose rises after,47.92,2.88,50.800000000000004,
eating,49.84,3.76,53.6,
take the following examples,50.8,5.52,56.31999999999999,
example one,53.6,5.84,59.44,
you test before meal a and get a 5.0,56.32,5.44,61.76,
millimoles per liter reading,59.44,4.32,63.76,
you test two hours after the meal and,61.76,5.28,67.03999999999999,
get a 9.0 millimoles per liter reading,63.76,5.6,69.36,
so meal a has caused a rise of four,67.04,5.84,72.88000000000001,
millimoles per liter,69.36,5.759,75.119,
example 2,72.88,5.279,78.15899999999999,
you test before meal b and get a 7.0,75.119,5.04,80.159,happy
millimoles per liter reading,78.159,4.401,82.56,fear
you test 2 hours after the meal and get,80.159,5.6,85.759,happy
a 10.0 millimoles per liter reading,82.56,5.68,88.24000000000001,happy
so we see that meal b raises blood sugar,85.759,6.161,91.92,happy
by three millimoles per liter,88.24,3.68,91.92,happy
if we had just done a post meal reading,93.2,3.36,96.56,happy
we might have thought that meal a was,95.04,4.399,99.43900000000001,happy
the better option but because meal b has,96.56,4.72,101.28,
raised our blood sugar levels by a lower,99.439,4.0,103.439,
amount meal b does seem to be the better,101.28,3.839,105.119,
option for us,103.439,3.921,107.36,
your 4-hour reading should ideally show,105.119,4.081,109.2,
that your blood glucose levels have,107.36,3.6,110.96,
returned to the target range for,109.2,4.16,113.36,
pre-meal readings which is between four,110.96,4.479,115.439,
and seven millimoles per liter for most,113.36,3.84,117.2,
adults with diabetes,115.439,3.841,119.27999999999999,
these meals are just examples,117.2,3.919,121.119,
if you perform before and after meal,119.28,3.68,122.96000000000001,
readings you can see how your own blood,121.119,3.841,124.96,
glucose levels are affected by different,122.96,4.0,126.96,
meals,124.96,3.68,128.64,
when reviewing your blood glucose,126.96,3.439,130.399,
results it helps to know what your,128.64,3.52,132.16,
target results are,130.399,4.881,135.28,
the target levels recommended by nice,132.16,5.28,137.44,
vary slightly depending on your diabetes,135.28,3.679,138.959,
type,137.44,3.76,141.2,
for people with type 2 diabetes you,138.959,4.161,143.12,
should aim for a level of between 4 and,141.2,4.48,145.67999999999998,
7 millimoles per liter before meals and,143.12,4.96,148.08,
