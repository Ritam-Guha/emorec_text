pre and post meal testing involves,26.24,5.52,31.759999999999998,NA
performing a blood glucose test before,29.679,3.521,33.199999999999996,neutral
starting a meal,31.76,3.36,35.120000000000005,neutral

eating,38.719,3.441,42.160000000000004,neutral
in most cases you should find that blood,40.239,4.0,44.239,neutral
glucose results are higher after two,42.16,3.68,45.839999999999996,neutral
hours than they were before eating the,44.239,3.681,47.919999999999995,NA
meal you should be looking to see how,45.84,4.0,49.84,NA
much your blood glucose rises after,47.92,2.88,50.800000000000004,NA
eating,49.84,3.76,53.6,NA
take the following examples,50.8,5.52,56.31999999999999,NA
example one,53.6,5.84,59.44,NA
you test before meal a and get a 5.0,56.32,5.44,61.76,NA
millimoles per liter reading,59.44,4.32,63.76,NA
you test two hours after the meal and,61.76,5.28,67.03999999999999,NA
get a 9.0 millimoles per liter reading,63.76,5.6,69.36,NA
so meal a has caused a rise of four,67.04,5.84,72.88000000000001,NA
millimoles per liter,69.36,5.759,75.119,NA
example 2,72.88,5.279,78.15899999999999,neutral
you test before meal b and get a 7.0,75.119,5.04,80.159,neutral
millimoles per liter reading,78.159,4.401,82.56,neutral
you test 2 hours after the meal and get,80.159,5.6,85.759,neutral
a 10.0 millimoles per liter reading,82.56,5.68,88.24000000000001,neutral
so we see that meal b raises blood sugar,85.759,6.161,91.92,surprise
by three millimoles per liter,88.24,3.68,91.92,surprise
if we had just done a post meal reading,93.2,3.36,96.56,surprise
we might have thought that meal a was,95.04,4.399,99.43900000000001,surprise
the better option but because meal b has,96.56,4.72,101.28,NA

amount meal b does seem to be the better,101.28,3.839,105.119,NA
option for us,103.439,3.921,107.36,NA
your 4-hour reading should ideally show,105.119,4.081,109.2,NA

adults with diabetes,115.439,3.841,119.27999999999999,NA
these meals are just examples,117.2,3.919,121.119,NA
