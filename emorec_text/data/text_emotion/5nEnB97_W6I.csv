"Dr. Timothy Jackson: As a surgeon at the Toronto
Western Hospital bariatric clinic, I’d like to talk to you about the types of weight loss
surgeries that are currently performed in our clinic: The Roux-en-Y gastric bypass,
also called the “Roux-en-Y”, and the sleeve gastrectomy, also called the “sleeve”. Both have been proven to be effective treatments
for morbid obesity.",8.24,18.849999999999998,27.089999999999996,angry
"Each takes a few hours to perform, and requires
a short hospital stay. Research shows that the Roux-en-Y is the current
gold standard which means it has the best weight loss and health benefits. Let me show you more about the Roux-en-Y surgery
that we perform. To gain access to the abdominal
cavity, small incisions are created on the",27.09,19.539,46.629000000000005,angry
"abdomen. Trocars, which serve as passageways for the
surgical instruments, are placed into the incisions. The surgical instruments are passed through
the trocars to access the abdominal cavity. The surgeon observes the abdominal cavity
using a laparoscope, or video camera.",46.629,22.511,69.14,NA
"A small stomach pouch is created using a stapling
device. The small intestine is separated into two
sections, the lower portion of the small intestine is attached to the newly created stomach pouch. This allows food to pass directly into the
small intestine where digestion continues. The upper portion of the small intestine is
reconnected to the lower part of the intestine.",69.14,34.28,103.42,NA
"The bile and pancreatic fluids from the liver
and pancreas allow for food to be completely digested. By altering the anatomy of the gastro-intestinal
tract, gastric bypass changes signals in the body, resulting in decreased hunger and increased
feelings of fullness after meals. Dr. Timothy Jackson: As I mentioned before,
the Roux-en-Y is considered the gold standard",103.42,21.96,125.38,angry
"in weight loss surgery. In some cases there is another surgery we
do, called the “Sleeve”. Just like in the Roux-en-Y surgery,
trocars are placed to gain access to the abdominal cavity, and the abdomen is viewed laparoscopically. The average human stomach can expand to hold
around 1 to 1.5 litres of food.",125.38,21.160000000000004,146.54,angry
"While in the stomach, food is mixed with digestive
enzymes to help break down the food to a more simple form, so that it can be more easily
digested and absorbed when it is in the small bowel. During a sleeve gastectomy, a thin vertical
sleeve is created by using a stapling device. This sleeve will typically hold between 50
and 150 millilitres, or be about the size",146.54,25.41,171.95,NA
"of a banana. The excised portion of the stomach is removed. This results in decreased hunger and increased
feelings of fullness after meals. The bile and pancreatic fluids from the liver
and pancreas mix with the food, and allow it to be completely digested and absorbed
in the bowel.",171.95,19.58,191.52999999999997,NA
"There is no re-routing of the small bowel
needed for the sleeve gastrectomy. As with all weight loss
surgeries, success depends on making lifelong changes to your eating and exercise habits. All surgery has risks. Your weight, age, and medical history and
other factors determine your specific risk.",191.53,19.93,211.46,angry
