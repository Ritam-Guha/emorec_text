sugar will go higher okay so I think most people know that and if you want to reduce it you need to reduce your carbs and that should normally bring it down however what if it goes up especially in,11.58,23.999000000000002,35.579,NA
the morning what could it be well at about 8 o'clock in the morning you have this hormone shift okay you have this spike of this hormone called cortisol that's the stress hormone that will,23.76,31.349000000000004,55.10900000000001,NA
mobilize sugar from the body and spike blood sugars so it's coming from cortisol especially if there's an adrenal problem and there's insulin resistance number two you have low blood,38.309,27.271,65.58,NA
sugar for some reason it's hypoglycemia and you have these counter regulatory hormones including cortisol as one of them okay so but this is for a different reason,53.039,23.431,76.47,NA
this could happen anywhere during the day okay we're not talking about right after a meal we're talking about when you're not eating you have these three hormones cortisol glucagon and,64.83,19.14,83.97,NA
adrenaline that kicks in if your blood sugars get too low and that can raise your blood Sugar's so the reason you have hypoglycemia in the first place is you're somehow doing something to spike,74.34,22.828,97.168,NA
