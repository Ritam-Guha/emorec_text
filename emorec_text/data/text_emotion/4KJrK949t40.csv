in this video I'm going to talk about,0.03,3.81,3.84,fear
the other reasons why your blood sugar,1.29,5.04,6.33,
might be high you know other than you,3.84,5.25,9.09,
consuming carbohydrates as you might,6.33,5.25,11.58,
know when you consume carbs your blood,9.09,5.37,14.46,fear
sugar will go higher okay so I think,11.58,4.89,16.47,
most people know that and if you want to,14.46,3.81,18.27,
reduce it you need to reduce your carbs,16.47,3.84,20.31,
and that should normally bring it down,18.27,5.49,23.759999999999998,
however what if it goes up especially in,20.31,5.969,26.279,
the morning what could it be well at,23.76,6.63,30.39,
about 8 o'clock in the morning you have,26.279,6.511,32.79,
this hormone shift okay you have this,30.39,4.62,35.01,fear
spike of this hormone called cortisol,32.79,5.519,38.309,
that's the stress hormone that will,35.01,8.069,43.079,
mobilize sugar from the body and spike,38.309,7.651,45.959999999999994,
blood sugars so it's coming from,43.079,4.921,48.0,
cortisol especially if there's an,45.96,4.2,50.160000000000004,
adrenal problem and there's insulin,48.0,5.039,53.039,
resistance number two you have low blood,50.16,5.46,55.62,
sugar for some reason it's hypoglycemia,53.039,6.601,59.64,
and you have these counter regulatory,55.62,7.23,62.849999999999994,
hormones including cortisol as one of,59.64,4.89,64.53,
them okay so but this is for a different,62.85,1.98,64.83,
reason,64.53,2.73,67.26,
this could happen anywhere during the,64.83,4.859,69.689,
day okay we're not talking about right,67.26,3.87,71.13000000000001,
after a meal we're talking about when,69.689,3.211,72.89999999999999,angry
you're not eating you have these three,71.13,3.21,74.33999999999999,
hormones cortisol glucagon and,72.9,3.99,76.89,
adrenaline that kicks in if your blood,74.34,5.099,79.43900000000001,
sugars get too low and that can raise,76.89,4.229,81.119,
your blood Sugar's so the reason you,79.439,3.781,83.22,
have hypoglycemia in the first place is,81.119,4.89,86.009,
you're somehow doing something to spike,83.22,4.829,88.04899999999999,fear
insulin and it's pushing this blood,86.009,3.811,89.82,fear
sugar down and it could be because,88.049,3.151,91.2,
you're eating when you're eating you're,89.82,3.36,93.17999999999999,
eating a lot of carbs okay that could be,91.2,4.02,95.22,
one reason or you are eating too,93.18,4.259,97.43900000000001,
frequently so then we have the counter,95.22,4.35,99.57,
hormones coming in to try to push up the,97.439,4.441,101.88,
blood sugar and sometimes it could bring,99.57,3.869,103.439,
it up too high so that's another reason,101.88,3.93,105.81,
right there number three you had a snack,103.439,4.5,107.939,
late last night and it was a,105.81,4.53,110.34,
carbohydrate snack and what's happening,107.939,4.351,112.28999999999999,surprise
is that you're seeing the effects of the,110.34,5.639,115.979,surprise
blood sugar the next day and before you,112.29,5.579,117.869,surprise
ate sugar the day before and that will,115.979,3.57,119.54899999999999,neutral
throw off the blood sugars now if you,117.869,3.091,120.96,neutral
having a problem today with your blood,119.549,3.691,123.24000000000001,
sugars chances are the real cause of it,120.96,4.589,125.54899999999999,
was in the previous day where you ate,123.24,4.14,127.38,
some carb I mean people don't look at,125.549,3.3,128.84900000000002,
that they're focused right on what they,127.38,2.519,129.899,
ate like an hour ago,128.849,2.821,131.67,
however these blood sugar issues could,129.899,3.721,133.62,
actually be originating from,131.67,4.14,135.80999999999997,
something you did 24 hours ago alright,133.62,4.92,138.54,
number five low blood pressure let's say,135.81,4.05,139.86,
you're taking a lot of blood pressure,138.54,3.33,141.87,
medication where your blood pressure is,139.86,4.519,144.37900000000002,
too low guess what that will activate,141.87,5.31,147.18,
cortisol to bring it back up and,144.379,6.121,150.5,
actually raise your blood glucose levels,147.18,6.33,153.51000000000002,
all right number six you going through,150.5,5.62,156.12,
some type of stress that can raise your,153.51,5.67,159.17999999999998,
glucose level or you had trauma or you,156.12,5.039,161.159,
had an infection or you're taking,159.18,4.77,163.95000000000002,
cortisol synthetically like medication,161.159,4.55,165.709,
like you're taking prednisone or,163.95,5.64,169.58999999999997,
cortisol injections for some reason that,165.709,6.28,171.989,
could do it right there number seven you,169.59,4.32,173.91,neutral
forgot to take your medications if,171.989,3.87,175.859,
you're diabetic and you've forgot to,173.91,4.59,178.5,
take your insulin or whatever last night,175.859,4.681,180.54000000000002,
there's nothing there to push the blood,178.5,5.459,183.959,
sugar down so it's high today all right,180.54,5.58,186.12,
number eight you exercise the night,183.959,4.321,188.28,sad
before and that burned up all your sugar,186.12,4.679,190.799,
now guess what happens right here your,188.28,4.62,192.9,
body has these counter hormones that are,190.799,4.261,195.06,
gonna kick in and start raising your,192.9,5.07,197.97,
blood sugars and number nine you had,195.06,5.039,200.099,
hidden MSG in the diet,197.97,4.56,202.53,
monosodium glutamate which will increase,200.099,5.82,205.91899999999998,
blood sugars or you had artificial,202.53,5.639,208.169,
sweeteners which will also increase,205.919,4.891,210.81,surprise
