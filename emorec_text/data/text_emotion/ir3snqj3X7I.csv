hello everyone and welcome back to,0.399,2.881,3.28,neutral
clinical cousins youtube channel where,1.599,4.001,5.6000000000000005,neutral
today we are going to go over the drug,3.28,6.08,9.36,neutral
insulin aspart also known as nova log,5.6,6.32,11.92,neutral
this drug is classified as a rapid,9.36,4.72,14.079999999999998,neutral
acting insulin and is given for,11.92,3.839,15.759,sad
hyperglycemia,14.08,5.119,19.198999999999998,neutral
remember that nova log leaves no time,15.759,7.6,23.359,neutral
for hyperglycemia or that insulin aspart,19.199,7.281,26.48,neutral
starts a working a very fast,23.359,5.68,29.039,neutral
now it cannot be mixed with other,26.48,6.079,32.559,neutral
insulins besides nph insulin,29.039,5.841,34.88,neutral
and in pregnant women this drug has not,32.559,4.321,36.879999999999995,neutral
yet been proven safe,34.88,4.4,39.28,neutral
now what we need to know,36.88,5.839,42.719,neutral
is that this drug will bind to our,39.28,6.24,45.52,neutral
transmembrane receptors and start a,42.719,5.201,47.92,neutral
cascade of actions that eventually,45.52,5.519,51.039,neutral
result in the placement of glute4,47.92,4.4,52.32,neutral
transporters,51.039,3.761,54.800000000000004,neutral
in to our cell membrane,52.32,4.64,56.96,neutral
this allows glucose,54.8,4.559,59.358999999999995,neutral
to enter the cells by facilitated,56.96,3.759,60.719,neutral
diffusion,59.359,4.0,63.359,neutral
this also means that the glucose level,60.719,7.121,67.84,neutral
in the plasma will decrease,63.359,7.281,70.64,sad
now it is very important that we know,67.84,6.08,73.92,NA
that insulin has another very important,70.64,4.4,75.04,NA
action,73.92,4.08,78.0,neutral
it will make the potassium leave the,75.04,6.079,81.119,neutral
blood and enter our cells,78.0,6.08,84.08,neutral
insulin activates a train of reactions,81.119,5.281,86.4,neutral
that eventually stimulate,84.08,5.92,90.0,neutral
our sodium potassium atpases,86.4,7.12,93.52000000000001,neutral
remember that these atp aces push sodium,90.0,6.4,96.4,neutral
out of the cell and bring potassium into,93.52,4.32,97.84,neutral
the cell,96.4,4.399,100.799,neutral
this is very important because food has,97.84,6.959,104.799,neutral
a lot of glucose and potassium,100.799,6.721,107.52000000000001,neutral
if our bodies were to simply absorb all,104.799,4.64,109.43900000000001,neutral
of this potassium and do nothing about,107.52,5.279,112.79899999999999,NA
it it would cause us to have a paralytic,109.439,5.04,114.479,neutral
arrhythmia,112.799,4.881,117.68,neutral
this is why it is a smart idea to intake,114.479,6.801,121.28,neutral
glucose and potassium at the same time,117.68,6.0,123.68,neutral
you should be aware that your patient's,121.28,5.56,126.84,neutral
insulin need will increase as their body,123.68,5.76,129.44,neutral
experiences stressors,126.84,5.72,132.56,neutral
these stressors are things like surgery,129.44,4.72,134.16,neutral
sickness,132.56,4.319,136.879,neutral
trauma or fever,134.16,5.68,139.84,neutral
also be aware of the possibility of,136.879,5.161,142.04,neutral
developing a temporary,139.84,6.72,146.56,neutral
hypokalemia when you administer insulin,142.04,7.4,149.44,neutral
what you need to know is that this drug,146.56,6.16,152.72,neutral
has an onset of 10 minutes,149.44,6.32,155.76,neutral
a peak of 2 hours,152.72,3.68,156.4,neutral
and,155.76,4.96,160.72,neutral
effects or duration of 5 hours,156.4,8.08,164.48000000000002,neutral
remember that the nova log address is 10,160.72,5.44,166.16,neutral
to 5,164.48,5.2,169.67999999999998,NA
onset in 10 minutes,166.16,8.159,174.319,neutral
in two hours or the lowest blood glucose,169.68,8.0,177.68,neutral
and it will last for five hours,174.319,5.2,179.51899999999998,neutral
the side effects of this drug may,177.68,3.0,180.68,neutral
include,179.519,3.761,183.28,NA
hypoglycemia that can result in,180.68,6.12,186.8,neutral
pallor and tachycardia,183.28,4.64,187.92,neutral
weight gain,186.8,1.92,188.72,NA
and,187.92,4.239,192.159,neutral
lipo hypertrophy at the injection site,188.72,5.2,193.92,neutral
some commonly tested material about this,192.159,5.36,197.519,neutral
drug is that it is a rapid acting,193.92,4.72,198.64,neutral
insulin,197.519,1.921,199.44,NA
and,198.64,4.64,203.27999999999997,neutral
novolog leaves no time for hyperglycemia,199.44,7.519,206.959,neutral
remember that the address is 10 to 5,203.28,7.28,210.56,neutral
onset of 10 minutes peak of 2 hours and,206.959,5.521,212.48,neutral
duration of five hours,210.56,2.72,213.28,neutral
and,212.48,3.039,215.51899999999998,neutral
lastly please remember that this drug,213.28,4.72,218.0,neutral
will rapidly decrease your patients,215.519,6.481,222.0,neutral
blood glucose and blood potassium levels,218.0,5.92,223.92,neutral
as always thank you for taking the time,222.0,3.44,225.44,sad
