hello everyone and welcome back to clinical cousins youtube channel where today we are going to go over the drug insulin aspart also known as nova log this drug is classified as a rapid,0.399,24.002,24.401,angry
acting insulin and is given for hyperglycemia remember that nova log leaves no time for hyperglycemia or that insulin aspart starts a working a very fast,11.92,29.519,41.439,angry
now it cannot be mixed with other insulins besides nph insulin and in pregnant women this drug has not yet been proven safe now what we need to know,26.48,26.479999999999997,52.959999999999994,angry
is that this drug will bind to our transmembrane receptors and start a cascade of actions that eventually result in the placement of glute4 transporters,39.28,25.121,64.401,angry
in to our cell membrane this allows glucose to enter the cells by facilitated diffusion this also means that the glucose level,52.32,24.079,76.399,angry
in the plasma will decrease now it is very important that we know that insulin has another very important action it will make the potassium leave the,63.359,27.92,91.279,angry
blood and enter our cells insulin activates a train of reactions that eventually stimulate our sodium potassium atpases remember that these atp aces push sodium,78.0,30.801000000000002,108.801,angry
out of the cell and bring potassium into the cell this is very important because food has a lot of glucose and potassium if our bodies were to simply absorb all,93.52,27.039,120.559,angry
of this potassium and do nothing about it it would cause us to have a paralytic arrhythmia this is why it is a smart idea to intake glucose and potassium at the same time,107.52,28.000999999999998,135.521,angry
you should be aware that your patient's insulin need will increase as their body experiences stressors these stressors are things like surgery sickness,121.28,26.078999999999997,147.359,angry
trauma or fever also be aware of the possibility of developing a temporary hypokalemia when you administer insulin what you need to know is that this drug,134.16,31.121,165.281,angry
has an onset of 10 minutes a peak of 2 hours and effects or duration of 5 hours remember that the nova log address is 10,149.44,28.48,177.92,angry
to 5 onset in 10 minutes in two hours or the lowest blood glucose and it will last for five hours the side effects of this drug may,164.48,29.559,194.039,angry
include hypoglycemia that can result in pallor and tachycardia weight gain and,179.519,20.680000000000003,200.199,angry
lipo hypertrophy at the injection site some commonly tested material about this drug is that it is a rapid acting insulin and,188.72,21.841,210.561,angry
novolog leaves no time for hyperglycemia remember that the address is 10 to 5 onset of 10 minutes peak of 2 hours and duration of five hours and,199.44,26.079,225.519,angry
lastly please remember that this drug will rapidly decrease your patients blood glucose and blood potassium levels as always thank you for taking the time to learn with us today and remember to,213.28,26.761000000000003,240.041,angry
