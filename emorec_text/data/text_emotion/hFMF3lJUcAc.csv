[Music] all the energy on our planet earth comes from the sun but we humans much like every other animal are not able to directly harvest the,0.05,21.391000000000002,21.441000000000003,NA
energy that comes from the sun plants do this work for us in their leaves plants contain a green pigment called chlorophyll that enables them to use the,10.16,19.28,29.44,NA
energy from the sun to combine water and carbon dioxide and turn them into oxygen and the sugar glucose this process is called,20.0,19.519000000000002,39.519000000000005,NA
photosynthesis glucose is the most abundant sugar in nature and it stores the energy coming from the sun in a form that can then be used by,29.119,17.759,46.878,angry
plants and animals as well glucose can also be further processed to other more complex carbohydrates such as starch for longer term energy storage,38.399,18.881999999999998,57.281,angry
or even transform to other nutrients such as lipids amino acids or vitamins sometimes incorporating minerals that are found in the soil by eating,47.84,17.68,65.52000000000001,happy
plants or animals who previously ate plants we can get these molecules and use them to sustain our own life without plants on this,57.36,17.279999999999998,74.64,sad
planet we would not be able to survive we would still have plenty of energy coming from the sun but no way of using it it would be like,66.0,19.359,85.35900000000001,sad
being thirsty in the middle of the ocean surrounded by water but water we cannot drink carbohydrates are at the basis of human diet the word all over,74.88,22.161,97.041,fear
rice pasta bread potatoes cassava banana corn are staple foods for billions of people and are primarily sources of carbohydrates,85.28,19.599,104.879,sad
carbohydrate means hydrated carbon and that's what the plants do when they combine water and carbon dioxide to make glucose they split water into oxygen and hydrogen,95.28,23.28,118.56,sad
and add these molecules to carbon creating energy rich bonds when these bonds will be broken down they will be able to release the energy that they store,107.28,20.32,127.6,fear
this process which is cellular respiration is basically the opposite of photosynthesis and is what happens inside all of our cells,117.759,18.4,136.159,sad
to extract energy from nutrients this molecule is glucose also called dextrose it contains six atoms of carbons bound to each other,126.399,20.801000000000002,147.2,sad
and two atoms of hydrogen and oxygen the primary function of glucose is of course an energetic one it gives us 4 kilocalories per gram glucose is not our only source of energy,136.8,23.52,160.32000000000002,sad
we can also get energy from other carbohydrates as well as fat and proteins however glucose is the easiest molecule to get energy from it is readily available fuel for all of,149.04,21.919,170.959,sad
our cells it also has another big advantage in emergency situations when our oxygen supply is limited for example during intense physical activity,160.4,23.361,183.761,sad
we can extract some energy from glucose even without oxygen whereas for example we cannot burn any fat without oxygen for this reason while fat is our main,171.28,21.44,192.72,fear
fuel at rest and during light activity glucose becomes our main fuel during intense physical activity when blood and oxygen supply to our muscle,183.04,19.519,202.559,fear
cells become scarce but this doesn't mean that we don't need glucose for energy even when we are at rest glucose is always necessary to,192.879,19.921,212.79999999999998,sad
completely burn fats for energy without the intermediate molecules that derive from glucose breakdown fats can only be broken down partially,202.48,20.240000000000002,222.72,sad
and release their energy incompletely like biochemists like to say fat burns on the flame of carbs on top of that there are some tissues in,212.48,20.96,233.44,sad
our body that can get their energy only from glucose these include our brain our nervous system in general and our red blood cells,223.36,18.639,241.99900000000002,sad
for all these reasons we must have a certain amount of glucose circulating in our bloodstream at all times and as we will soon learn our body goes to extreme lengths to,231.76,22.560000000000002,254.32,sad
ensure that a constant supply of glucose is always maintained for example in emergency situations when blood glucose levels start to dangerously drop our body can build its own glucose,243.12,23.201,266.321,sad
starting from proteins but this is a waste because proteins are normally used for more important structural and regulatory functions,255.12,17.84,272.96,fear
besides since our body doesn't store extra protein we may need to steal these proteins from our lean mass for example our muscles so this,263.52,18.717999999999996,282.238,fear
indirectly is another important function of glucose it spares precious proteins from being used as sources of glucose and energy,273.759,19.122,292.88100000000003,sad
another important function of blood glucose is to signal hunger and satiety you already know that high or raising blood glucose signals at its time to stop eating,282.8,22.64,305.44,sad
while the law or dropping blood glucose signals that it's time to eat again so to recap these are the main functions of glucose in our body it provides readily available energy for,293.84,22.64,316.47999999999996,fear
our body at rest and during life activity it is the only source of energy during intense anaerobic physical activity it provides energy for our brain nervous,305.44,21.200000000000003,326.64,fear
system and red blood cells at all times it allows an efficient utilization of fats for energy it spares proteins from use a source of energy and blood glucose,315.68,20.48,336.16,fear
and its blood variations signal hunger and satiety glucose and other sugars also play more fine-tuned structural and regulatory functions in our body,326.08,21.198,347.27799999999996,fear
for example they are often used as tags for molecules to traffic them inside our cells or indicate their destination they are also part of complex structures,336.639,21.122,357.761,NA
on the surface of our cell membranes that play a role in signaling cell cell communication recognition and immunity cell surface glycosaminoglycans protect and lubricate,347.28,21.119,368.399,NA
our joints and most of our tissues a particular sugar ribose is a key structural component of our dna,358.479,18.319000000000003,376.798,NA
all these advanced functions of sugars however are not strictly relevant from a nutritional point of view because nutritionally sugars are non-essential,367.039,20.082,387.121,NA
this means that our body can easily interconvert sugars into one another or build them starting from other molecules so whenever it needs to build a,376.96,19.119,396.07899999999995,NA
particular sugar containing molecule it can easily build the sugar components it needs without having to get them directly from food this is not possible for example,386.639,20.961,407.6,NA
for many amino acids involved in protein synthesis as well as some lipids,396.96,17.678,414.638,NA
