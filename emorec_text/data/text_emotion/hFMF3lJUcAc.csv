all the energy on our planet earth,0.799,5.681,6.48,
comes from the sun but we humans much,3.439,4.4,7.839,
like every other animal,6.48,3.68,10.16,
are not able to directly harvest the,7.839,4.241,12.08,
energy that comes from the sun,10.16,4.32,14.48,
plants do this work for us in their,12.08,4.8,16.88,
leaves plants contain a green pigment,14.48,2.799,17.279,
called,16.88,3.12,20.0,
chlorophyll that enables them to use the,17.279,4.241,21.52,
energy from the sun,20.0,4.48,24.48,
to combine water and carbon dioxide and,21.52,4.48,26.0,
turn them into oxygen,24.48,4.16,28.64,neutral
and the sugar glucose this process is,26.0,3.119,29.119,neutral
called,28.64,3.28,31.92,neutral
photosynthesis glucose is the most,29.119,3.921,33.04,neutral
abundant sugar,31.92,3.44,35.36,neutral
in nature and it stores the energy,33.04,3.44,36.48,neutral
coming from the sun,35.36,3.039,38.399,neutral
in a form that can then be used by,36.48,3.919,40.398999999999994,neutral
plants and animals as well,38.399,4.401,42.8,neutral
glucose can also be further processed to,40.399,3.601,44.0,neutral
other more complex,42.8,3.68,46.48,neutral
carbohydrates such as starch for longer,44.0,3.84,47.84,neutral
term energy storage,46.48,3.36,49.839999999999996,neutral
or even transform to other nutrients,47.84,3.039,50.879000000000005,neutral
such as lipids,49.84,3.52,53.36000000000001,neutral
amino acids or vitamins sometimes,50.879,4.0,54.879,neutral
incorporating minerals,53.36,4.0,57.36,neutral
that are found in the soil by eating,54.879,3.121,58.0,neutral
plants,57.36,3.28,60.64,neutral
or animals who previously ate plants we,58.0,4.8,62.8,neutral
can get these molecules and use them to,60.64,2.8,63.44,neutral
sustain,62.8,3.2,66.0,neutral
our own life without plants on this,63.44,3.2,66.64,neutral
planet,66.0,3.439,69.439,neutral
we would not be able to survive we would,66.64,5.04,71.68,neutral
still have plenty of energy coming from,69.439,2.961,72.39999999999999,neutral
the sun,71.68,3.2,74.88000000000001,neutral
but no way of using it it would be like,72.4,4.719,77.119,neutral
being thirsty in the middle of the ocean,74.88,5.04,79.92,neutral
surrounded by water but water we cannot,77.119,3.761,80.88,neutral
drink,79.92,3.28,83.2,neutral
carbohydrates are at the basis of human,80.88,4.4,85.28,neutral
diet the word all over,83.2,5.68,88.88,neutral
rice pasta bread potatoes cassava banana,85.28,6.0,91.28,neutral
corn are staple foods for billions of,88.88,3.04,91.92,neutral
people,91.28,2.64,93.92,neutral
and are primarily sources of,91.92,3.36,95.28,neutral
carbohydrates,93.92,4.559,98.479,neutral
carbohydrate means hydrated carbon and,95.28,5.28,100.56,neutral
that's what the plants do when they,98.479,4.32,102.799,neutral
combine water and carbon dioxide,100.56,5.199,105.759,neutral
to make glucose they split water into,102.799,4.481,107.28,neutral
oxygen and hydrogen,105.759,4.0,109.759,neutral
and add these molecules to carbon,107.28,4.64,111.92,neutral
creating energy rich bonds,109.759,4.4,114.159,neutral
when these bonds will be broken down,111.92,4.559,116.479,neutral
they will be able to release the energy,114.159,3.6,117.759,neutral
that they store,116.479,3.121,119.6,neutral
this process which is cellular,117.759,3.201,120.96,neutral
respiration,119.6,3.0,122.6,neutral
is basically the opposite of,120.96,3.92,124.88,neutral
photosynthesis and is what happens,122.6,3.799,126.399,neutral
inside all of our cells,124.88,4.48,129.35999999999999,neutral
to extract energy from nutrients this,126.399,3.601,130.0,neutral
molecule,129.36,3.599,132.959,neutral
is glucose also called dextrose it,130.0,3.599,133.599,neutral
contains,132.959,3.841,136.8,neutral
six atoms of carbons bound to each other,133.599,6.161,139.76,neutral
and two atoms of hydrogen and oxygen the,136.8,5.36,142.16000000000003,neutral
primary function of glucose is of course,139.76,3.68,143.44,neutral
an energetic one,142.16,4.159,146.319,neutral
it gives us 4 kilocalories per gram,143.44,5.6,149.04,neutral
glucose is not our only source of energy,146.319,4.721,151.04,neutral
we can also get energy from other,149.04,4.0,153.04,neutral
carbohydrates as well as fat,151.04,4.4,155.44,neutral
and proteins however glucose is the,153.04,4.72,157.76,neutral
easiest molecule to get energy from,155.44,4.96,160.4,neutral
it is readily available fuel for all of,157.76,3.839,161.599,neutral
our cells,160.4,4.0,164.4,neutral
it also has another big advantage in,161.599,4.881,166.48,neutral
emergency situations when our,164.4,4.64,169.04,neutral
oxygen supply is limited for example,166.48,4.8,171.28,neutral
during intense physical activity,169.04,5.04,174.07999999999998,neutral
we can extract some energy from glucose,171.28,4.48,175.76,neutral
even without oxygen,174.08,4.079,178.15900000000002,neutral
whereas for example we cannot burn any,175.76,4.64,180.39999999999998,neutral
fat without oxygen,178.159,4.881,183.04,neutral
for this reason while fat is our main,180.4,3.36,183.76000000000002,neutral
fuel at,183.04,3.6,186.64,neutral
rest and during light activity glucose,183.76,4.399,188.159,neutral
becomes our main fuel,186.64,4.08,190.72,neutral
during intense physical activity when,188.159,4.72,192.879,neutral
blood and oxygen supply to our muscle,190.72,2.72,193.44,neutral
cells,192.879,3.601,196.48,neutral
become scarce but this doesn't mean that,193.44,5.2,198.64,neutral
we don't need glucose for energy even,196.48,3.92,200.39999999999998,neutral
when we are at rest,198.64,3.84,202.48,neutral
glucose is always necessary to,200.4,3.36,203.76000000000002,neutral
completely burn,202.48,4.319,206.79899999999998,neutral
fats for energy without the intermediate,203.76,5.039,208.79899999999998,neutral
molecules that derive from glucose,206.799,2.961,209.76000000000002,neutral
breakdown,208.799,3.681,212.48000000000002,neutral
fats can only be broken down partially,209.76,4.24,214.0,neutral
and release their energy,212.48,4.72,217.2,neutral
incompletely like biochemists like to,214.0,3.92,217.92,neutral
say,217.2,3.759,220.95899999999997,neutral
fat burns on the flame of carbs,217.92,5.44,223.35999999999999,neutral
on top of that there are some tissues in,220.959,3.121,224.08,neutral
our body,223.36,2.72,226.08,neutral
that can get their energy only from,224.08,4.239,228.31900000000002,neutral
glucose these include our brain,226.08,4.4,230.48000000000002,neutral
our nervous system in general and our,228.319,3.441,231.76,neutral
red blood cells,230.48,3.839,234.319,neutral
for all these reasons we must have a,231.76,4.64,236.39999999999998,neutral
certain amount of glucose circulating in,234.319,3.2,237.51899999999998,neutral
our bloodstream,236.4,4.24,240.64000000000001,neutral
at all times and as we will soon learn,237.519,5.601,243.12,neutral
our body goes to extreme lengths to,240.64,4.879,245.51899999999998,neutral
ensure that a constant supply of glucose,243.12,4.96,248.08,neutral
is always maintained for example in,245.519,4.961,250.48000000000002,neutral
emergency situations when blood glucose,248.08,4.4,252.48000000000002,neutral
levels start to dangerously drop,250.48,4.64,255.11999999999998,neutral
our body can build its own glucose,252.48,4.24,256.71999999999997,neutral
starting from proteins,255.12,3.76,258.88,neutral
but this is a waste because proteins are,256.72,3.039,259.759,neutral
normally used,258.88,2.96,261.84,neutral
for more important structural and,259.759,3.761,263.52000000000004,neutral
regulatory functions,261.84,4.32,266.15999999999997,neutral
besides since our body doesn't store,263.52,3.84,267.35999999999996,neutral
extra protein,266.16,3.52,269.68,neutral
we may need to steal these proteins from,267.36,3.44,270.8,neutral
our lean mass,269.68,4.079,273.759,neutral
for example our muscles so this,270.8,3.839,274.639,neutral
indirectly,273.759,3.681,277.44,neutral
is another important function of glucose,274.639,3.761,278.40000000000003,neutral
it spares,277.44,3.039,280.479,neutral
precious proteins from being used as,278.4,4.4,282.79999999999995,neutral
sources of glucose and energy,280.479,4.241,284.71999999999997,neutral
another important function of blood,282.8,3.52,286.32,neutral
glucose is to signal,284.72,4.64,289.36,neutral
hunger and satiety you already know that,286.32,5.92,292.24,neutral
high or raising blood glucose signals at,289.36,4.48,293.84000000000003,neutral
its time to stop eating,292.24,4.08,296.32,neutral
while the law or dropping blood glucose,293.84,3.76,297.59999999999997,happy
signals that it's time,296.32,3.84,300.15999999999997,neutral
to eat again so to recap these are the,297.6,5.36,302.96000000000004,neutral
main functions of glucose in our body,300.16,5.28,305.44,neutral
it provides readily available energy for,302.96,4.4,307.35999999999996,neutral
our body at rest and during life,305.44,2.88,308.32,neutral
activity,307.36,3.2,310.56,neutral
it is the only source of energy during,308.32,4.879,313.199,neutral
intense anaerobic physical activity,310.56,5.12,315.68,neutral
it provides energy for our brain nervous,313.199,5.121,318.32,neutral
system and red blood cells at all times,315.68,4.88,320.56,neutral
it allows an efficient utilization of,318.32,3.68,322.0,neutral
fats for energy,320.56,3.84,324.4,neutral
it spares proteins from use a source of,322.0,4.08,326.08,neutral
energy and blood glucose,324.4,4.0,328.4,neutral
and its blood variations signal hunger,326.08,3.92,330.0,neutral
and satiety,328.4,4.16,332.56,neutral
glucose and other sugars also play more,330.0,4.96,334.96,neutral
fine-tuned structural and regulatory,332.56,4.079,336.639,neutral
functions in our body,334.96,4.079,339.039,neutral

nutritional point of view,371.6,3.68,375.28000000000003,NA
because nutritionally sugars are,373.039,3.921,376.96,NA
non-essential,375.28,4.08,379.35999999999996,NA
this means that our body can easily,376.96,3.92,380.88,NA
