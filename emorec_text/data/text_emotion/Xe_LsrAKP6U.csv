hi my name is Jennifer de Rossi DeCosta,8.62,4.95,13.57,happy
I'm a certified diabetes educator and,11.23,4.14,15.370000000000001,happy
registered nurse for Southwest hospitals,13.57,3.54,17.11,happy
group and today I'd like to talk to you,15.37,4.47,19.84,happy
about insulin pump therapy insulin pumps,17.11,5.13,22.24,happy
are small page like devices that deliver,19.84,4.74,24.58,happy
insulin they deliver insulin in two,22.24,4.29,26.529999999999998,happy
different ways one way is that it,24.58,4.35,28.93,happy
delivers insulin in a slow fashion a,26.53,4.589,31.119,happy
continuous fashion which is called a,28.93,4.23,33.16,happy
basal rate this basal rate runs,31.119,5.251,36.37,happy
continuously for 24 hours it's very,33.16,4.89,38.05,surprise
similar to what you might already be,36.37,4.02,40.39,surprise
using for insulin called Lantis or 11:00,38.05,4.439,42.489,surprise
ER which is continuous or slow acting,40.39,5.58,45.97,happy
the insulin pump also uses insulin and,42.489,5.611,48.099999999999994,happy
delivers it in a quick way it delivers,45.97,4.23,50.2,happy
insulin as a large burst of insulin,48.1,3.15,51.25,happy
which is called,50.2,3.359,53.559000000000005,happy
a bolus a bolus would be delivered,51.25,4.079,55.329,happy
through the pump anytime that you eat,53.559,4.081,57.64,happy
grams of carbohydrate or anytime your,55.329,4.89,60.219,happy
blood sugar is elevated for instance if,57.64,4.259,61.899,happy
your blood sugar is above your target,60.219,4.171,64.39,happy
you would give more insulin that's,61.899,5.401,67.3,happy
called the bolus now I know this sounds,64.39,4.649,69.039,happy
difficult to understand but actually,67.3,3.27,70.57,happy
insulin pumps are pretty easy to use,69.039,3.901,72.94,fear
prior to someone going on an insulin,70.57,4.32,74.88999999999999,fear
pump you would be thoroughly trained on,72.94,3.959,76.899,happy
how to use these now to clear up some,74.89,6.03,80.92,happy
misconceptions insulin pumps are easy to,76.899,6.36,83.259,happy
use with training there is not a,80.92,4.289,85.209,happy
surgical procedure there's no surgery,83.259,5.161,88.42,happy
involved most people feel that insulin,85.209,4.981,90.19,happy
pumps are probably too fragile for your,88.42,3.42,91.84,happy
lifestyle and that's actually a,90.19,2.55,92.74,happy
misconception,91.84,3.27,95.11,happy
insulin pumps are used by all types of,92.74,4.14,96.88,happy
people from children to professional,95.11,5.459,100.569,happy
athletes in addition to that pumps do,96.88,5.67,102.55,happy
not know what your blood Sugar's are you,100.569,3.72,104.289,happy
still have to monitor your blood sugar,102.55,3.84,106.39,happy
and you basically tell the pump how much,104.289,4.291,108.58,happy
insulin to give it does not know what,106.39,4.56,110.95,happy
your blood sugars are so hopefully this,108.58,3.929,112.509,happy
gets you thinking about what insulin,110.95,3.75,114.7,happy
pumps are all about and we hope to see,112.509,3.961,116.47,happy
you here I think it's a great tool for,114.7,3.93,118.63000000000001,happy
people to use in fact I personally use,116.47,4.22,120.69,happy
an insulin pump for the last 15 years,118.63,4.409,123.039,happy
hope to see you at the diabetes program,120.69,4.269,124.959,happy
