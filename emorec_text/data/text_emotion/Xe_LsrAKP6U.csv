hi my name is Jennifer de Rossi DeCosta,8.62,4.95,13.57,NA
I'm a certified diabetes educator and,11.23,4.14,15.370000000000001,fear
registered nurse for Southwest hospitals,13.57,3.54,17.11,fear
group and today I'd like to talk to you,15.37,4.47,19.84,fear
about insulin pump therapy insulin pumps,17.11,5.13,22.24,fear
are small page like devices that deliver,19.84,4.74,24.58,sad
insulin they deliver insulin in two,22.24,4.29,26.529999999999998,sad
different ways one way is that it,24.58,4.35,28.93,sad
delivers insulin in a slow fashion a,26.53,4.589,31.119,sad
continuous fashion which is called a,28.93,4.23,33.16,sad
basal rate this basal rate runs,31.119,5.251,36.37,fear
continuously for 24 hours it's very,33.16,4.89,38.05,sad
similar to what you might already be,36.37,4.02,40.39,sad
using for insulin called Lantis or 11:00,38.05,4.439,42.489,sad
ER which is continuous or slow acting,40.39,5.58,45.97,sad
the insulin pump also uses insulin and,42.489,5.611,48.099999999999994,sad
delivers it in a quick way it delivers,45.97,4.23,50.2,sad
insulin as a large burst of insulin,48.1,3.15,51.25,surprise
which is called,50.2,3.359,53.559000000000005,fear
a bolus a bolus would be delivered,51.25,4.079,55.329,sad
through the pump anytime that you eat,53.559,4.081,57.64,sad
grams of carbohydrate or anytime your,55.329,4.89,60.219,sad
blood sugar is elevated for instance if,57.64,4.259,61.899,happy
your blood sugar is above your target,60.219,4.171,64.39,surprise
you would give more insulin that's,61.899,5.401,67.3,surprise
called the bolus now I know this sounds,64.39,4.649,69.039,fear
difficult to understand but actually,67.3,3.27,70.57,fear
insulin pumps are pretty easy to use,69.039,3.901,72.94,sad
prior to someone going on an insulin,70.57,4.32,74.88999999999999,sad
pump you would be thoroughly trained on,72.94,3.959,76.899,sad
how to use these now to clear up some,74.89,6.03,80.92,sad
misconceptions insulin pumps are easy to,76.899,6.36,83.259,sad
use with training there is not a,80.92,4.289,85.209,sad
surgical procedure there's no surgery,83.259,5.161,88.42,fear
involved most people feel that insulin,85.209,4.981,90.19,sad
pumps are probably too fragile for your,88.42,3.42,91.84,sad
lifestyle and that's actually a,90.19,2.55,92.74,happy
misconception,91.84,3.27,95.11,sad
insulin pumps are used by all types of,92.74,4.14,96.88,sad
people from children to professional,95.11,5.459,100.569,sad
athletes in addition to that pumps do,96.88,5.67,102.55,sad
not know what your blood Sugar's are you,100.569,3.72,104.289,sad
still have to monitor your blood sugar,102.55,3.84,106.39,surprise
and you basically tell the pump how much,104.289,4.291,108.58,surprise
insulin to give it does not know what,106.39,4.56,110.95,sad
your blood sugars are so hopefully this,108.58,3.929,112.509,sad
gets you thinking about what insulin,110.95,3.75,114.7,sad
pumps are all about and we hope to see,112.509,3.961,116.47,fear
you here I think it's a great tool for,114.7,3.93,118.63000000000001,sad
people to use in fact I personally use,116.47,4.22,120.69,sad
an insulin pump for the last 15 years,118.63,4.409,123.039,sad
hope to see you at the diabetes program,120.69,4.269,124.959,fear
