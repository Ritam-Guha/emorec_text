frequently and i'll talk about that today i am dr ahmed ergin i'm an endocrinologist and a diabetes education specialist,9.92,17.119,27.039,NA
and let's talk about beets okay guys so beets are nice and tasty not everybody likes them but actually they are like medicinal food,17.92,22.719,40.639,NA
they do not necessarily help your diabetes per se but it helps a lot other things and i'll tell you what they are but let's talk about diabetes part first,34.079,20.239,54.318,happy
now one cup of raw beets are around 13 grams of carbs and they have good amount of fiber so you end up with around nine grams of net carbs,45.039,24.561,69.6,happy
which is not bad right so it's low in calories there's a great addition to your salad some people even drink beet juice but what is really important about beets,56.64,19.281,75.92099999999999,happy
is it is very good for your blood pressure a significant blood pressure drop has been seen with beets and beet juice now the,66.96,21.599999999999998,88.55999999999999,happy
beaches may have more carbohydrates in it so you have to be careful about how much you consume but it is very high in folate and b vitamins and very high in antioxidants,77.52,24.72,102.24,happy
now one of the antioxidants is alpha lipoic acid which has been shown to reduce the nerve damage in patients with diabetes so it helps your blood pressure,89.6,20.720000000000002,110.32,happy
reduction and it helps with the nerve damage now how does it do that there are nitrates which are a derivative of nitric oxide or,100.4,18.96,119.36000000000001,happy
it leads to the creation of nitric oxide and nitric oxide is a primary molecule that dilates your blood vessels and most of us as we get older,109.04,21.439,130.479,happy
and due to variety of other diseases such as diabetes and insulin resistance our blood vessels get stiffer and stiffer and we need some sort of dilators so that,120.079,22.000999999999998,142.07999999999998,happy
the elasticity in your blood vessels remain better and more like healthier and nitric oxide is one of the things that really help you to achieve that as we get older nitric,131.2,22.639000000000003,153.839,happy
oxide production goes down due to problems like insulin resistance it goes down but the beets and beet juice really helps to,142.959,18.96,161.919,happy
regenerate that nitric oxide that you need in order to create that elasticity in your arteries up to eight to ten millimeter mercury,151.76,16.240000000000002,168.0,happy
drop in your blood pressure is achievable when you incorporate the bees in your diet as i said it's not very high in carbs and it's a great addition to help,160.879,21.601,182.48,happy
control your blood pressure also if you continuously use it it because of the alpha lipoic acid content in it it will definitely help prevent the nerve damage,171.2,22.479,193.67899999999997,happy
as well again i like beets in my salad most of the time and i think if you haven't tried it try that you will like that as well also because of the nitric oxide,181.599,23.121,204.72,happy
