hi guys welcome to another episode of,0.32,2.8,3.1199999999999997,happy
sugar md,2.32,4.479,6.7989999999999995,happy
today we are talking about beets,3.12,6.32,9.440000000000001,happy
are beats good for diabetes i get this,6.799,3.121,9.92,happy
question,9.44,2.88,12.32,happy
frequently and i'll talk about that,9.92,3.28,13.2,happy
today,12.32,2.56,14.88,happy
i am dr ahmed ergin i'm an,13.2,3.68,16.88,happy
endocrinologist and a diabetes education,14.88,3.04,17.92,happy
specialist,16.88,4.559,21.439,happy
and let's talk about beets,17.92,3.519,21.439,happy
okay guys so beets are nice,24.16,5.6,29.759999999999998,happy
and tasty not everybody likes them but,27.519,3.361,30.88,happy
actually,29.76,4.319,34.079,happy
they are like medicinal food,30.88,5.92,36.8,happy
they do not necessarily help your,34.079,4.241,38.32,happy
diabetes per se,36.8,3.599,40.399,happy
but it helps a lot other things and i'll,38.32,4.079,42.399,happy
tell you what they are,40.399,4.64,45.039,happy
but let's talk about diabetes part first,42.399,3.68,46.079,happy
now one cup of,45.039,4.961,50.0,happy
raw beets are around 13 grams of carbs,46.079,6.48,52.559,happy
and they have good amount of fiber so,50.0,3.44,53.44,happy
you end up with,52.559,4.081,56.64,happy
around nine grams of net carbs,53.44,5.599,59.039,happy
which is not bad right so it's low in,56.64,3.52,60.160000000000004,happy
calories,59.039,2.801,61.84,happy
there's a great addition to your salad,60.16,3.92,64.08,happy
some people even drink beet juice,61.84,5.12,66.96000000000001,happy
but what is really important about beets,64.08,3.92,68.0,happy
is,66.96,4.24,71.19999999999999,happy
it is very good for your blood pressure,68.0,5.52,73.52,happy
a significant blood pressure drop has,71.2,3.36,74.56,happy
been seen,73.52,4.0,77.52,happy
with beets and beet juice now the,74.56,4.48,79.04,happy
beaches may have more,77.52,3.36,80.88,happy
carbohydrates in it so you have to be,79.04,3.68,82.72000000000001,happy
careful about how much you consume,80.88,4.96,85.83999999999999,happy
but it is very high in folate and b,82.72,6.88,89.6,happy
vitamins and very high in antioxidants,85.84,5.84,91.68,happy
now one of the antioxidants is alpha,89.6,3.519,93.119,happy
lipoic acid,91.68,3.92,95.60000000000001,happy
which has been shown to reduce the nerve,93.119,4.881,98.0,happy
damage in patients with diabetes,95.6,4.8,100.39999999999999,happy
so it helps your blood pressure,98.0,3.6,101.6,happy
reduction,100.4,2.96,103.36,happy
and it helps with the nerve damage now,101.6,3.6,105.19999999999999,happy
how does it do that there are,103.36,4.56,107.92,happy
nitrates which are a derivative of,105.2,3.84,109.04,happy
nitric oxide or,107.92,4.0,111.92,happy
it leads to the creation of nitric oxide,109.04,6.079,115.119,happy
and nitric oxide is a primary molecule,111.92,3.6,115.52,happy
that,115.119,2.96,118.079,happy
dilates your blood vessels and most of,115.52,4.559,120.079,happy
us as we get older,118.079,4.241,122.32,happy
and due to variety of other diseases,120.079,4.881,124.96,happy
such as diabetes and insulin resistance,122.32,4.72,127.03999999999999,happy
our blood vessels get stiffer and,124.96,3.439,128.399,happy
stiffer and,127.04,4.16,131.20000000000002,happy
we need some sort of dilators so that,128.399,4.801,133.2,happy
the elasticity in your blood vessels,131.2,5.2,136.39999999999998,happy
remain better and more like healthier,133.2,5.92,139.11999999999998,happy
and nitric oxide is one of the things,136.4,4.24,140.64000000000001,happy
that really help you,139.12,3.839,142.959,happy
to achieve that as we get older nitric,140.64,3.44,144.07999999999998,happy
oxide production,142.959,3.201,146.16,happy
goes down due to problems like insulin,144.08,3.76,147.84,happy
resistance it goes down,146.16,4.32,150.48,happy
but the beets and beet juice really,147.84,3.92,151.76,happy
helps to,150.48,3.759,154.23899999999998,happy
regenerate that nitric oxide that you,151.76,3.119,154.879,happy
need,154.239,2.801,157.04,happy
in order to create that elasticity in,154.879,3.281,158.16,happy
your arteries,157.04,3.839,160.879,happy
up to eight to ten millimeter mercury,158.16,3.2,161.35999999999999,happy
drop,160.879,3.601,164.48,happy
in your blood pressure is achievable,161.36,5.2,166.56,happy
when you incorporate the bees in your,164.48,4.64,169.11999999999998,happy
diet as i said it's not very high in,166.56,4.64,171.2,happy
carbs and it's a great addition to help,169.12,3.52,172.64000000000001,happy
control your blood pressure,171.2,4.64,175.83999999999997,happy
also if you continuously use it it,172.64,5.44,178.07999999999998,happy
because of the alpha lipoic acid content,175.84,4.64,180.48,happy
in it it will definitely help prevent,178.08,3.519,181.59900000000002,happy
the nerve damage,180.48,4.24,184.72,happy
as well again i like beets in my,181.599,6.0,187.599,happy
salad most of the time and i think if,184.72,4.0,188.72,happy
you haven't tried it,187.599,3.92,191.51899999999998,happy
try that you will like that as well also,188.72,4.64,193.35999999999999,happy
because of the nitric oxide,191.519,4.561,196.08,happy
content people who are into exercise,193.36,3.2,196.56,happy
which,196.08,2.4,198.48000000000002,happy
you all should be entering your side at,196.56,4.08,200.64000000000001,happy
this point right if you have diabetes,198.48,3.52,202.0,happy
and watching this channel,200.64,3.84,204.48,happy
but if you are having the problem of,202.0,4.879,206.879,happy
getting tired easily and your exercise,204.48,4.319,208.79899999999998,happy
capacity is not great,206.879,5.36,212.239,happy
try beats beats will help you to improve,208.799,5.201,214.0,happy
your exercise capacity as well because,212.239,3.201,215.44,happy
when you exercise,214.0,4.56,218.56,happy
your muscles need that blood flow,215.44,5.2,220.64,happy
and if your blood vessels like we,218.56,3.52,222.08,happy
discuss is not opening,220.64,5.28,225.92,happy
up then you will have the fatigue so,222.08,6.079,228.15900000000002,happy
