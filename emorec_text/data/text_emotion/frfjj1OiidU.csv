hello everyone this dr. jawanda,44.14,3.79,47.93,fear
I'm going to answer a question when,46.13,4.77,50.900000000000006,surprise
doing the ketogenic diet why would you,47.93,7.68,55.61,neutral
may have high blood sugar now the thing,50.9,5.97,56.87,neutral
about the ketogenic diets one thing I,55.61,3.57,59.18,sad
always ask my patients is okay how long,56.87,4.08,60.949999999999996,sad
do you want it how much weight have you,59.18,2.52,61.7,sad
lost,60.95,2.609,63.559000000000005,happy
and what's the duration of the weight,61.7,5.31,67.01,neutral
that you lost recently okay because what,63.559,4.981,68.53999999999999,sad
could happen is that they previously,67.01,5.18,72.19,sad
could have had insulin insulin resistant,68.54,5.7,74.24000000000001,sad
before they went Akio generate died,72.19,3.67,75.86,neutral
especially if they lost a lot of mount,74.24,2.879,77.119,NA
of weight if you lose a lot amount of,75.86,3.0,78.86,NA
weight most likely you've been you were,77.119,3.421,80.54,NA
in some resistant without even knowing,78.86,3.81,82.67,NA
okay because insulin resistance takes,80.54,5.52,86.06,sad
time to create what happens when you're,82.67,5.85,88.52,sad
in some resistance your body's pumping,86.06,4.65,90.71000000000001,neutral
out anywhere from five to nine times the,88.52,5.25,93.77,sad
amount of insulin into the system to,90.71,6.86,97.57,sad
create it's a resistance so the goal is,93.77,6.0,99.77,neutral
okay to make a greater blood sugar,97.57,4.329,101.89899999999999,NA
response because at the moment because,99.77,3.66,103.42999999999999,NA
when you're in some resistance what's,101.899,2.911,104.81,NA
happening the cells don't take insulin,103.43,5.52,108.95,NA
too easily so when you're when we take,104.81,5.91,110.72,neutral
in carbohydrate the function of insulin,108.95,3.779,112.729,neutral
is twofold one to lower blood glucose,110.72,5.52,116.24,sad
and also store fat so when we take in a,112.729,5.941,118.67,sad
carbohydrate meal our pancreas releases,116.24,4.23,120.47,NA
insulin to lower the blood glucose,118.67,4.32,122.99000000000001,NA
levels however if you're taking an,120.47,4.259,124.729,neutral
excess amount of carbohydrates yes,122.99,3.33,126.32,neutral
you're going to go on this wave pattern,124.729,4.411,129.14,NA
to the point where yes your instant,126.32,4.35,130.67,NA
resistant because the cells are not,129.14,5.099,134.23899999999998,neutral
actually bringing in the insulin okay so,130.67,4.8,135.47,neutral
what happens when you become insulin,134.239,4.171,138.41,NA
resistant it sends a signal to the liver,135.47,4.98,140.45,NA
the liver says hey okay I'm going to,138.41,4.38,142.79,neutral
make sugar okay if they're a process,140.45,4.68,145.13,neutral
called gluconeogenesis gluconeogenesis,142.79,5.07,147.85999999999999,neutral
as a process that we have to make sugar,145.13,4.68,149.81,sad
from a non carbohydrate source this is,147.86,5.01,152.87,sad
how we survive in between meals however,149.81,5.76,155.57,sad
if your insulin resistant already okay,152.87,3.69,156.56,NA
you're going to have too much,155.57,3.15,158.72,NA
circulating glucose and the pancreas is,156.56,4.86,161.42000000000002,neutral
going to shunt out more insulin okay and,158.72,4.32,163.04,neutral
this is where you can become more in,161.42,3.03,164.45,NA
some resistance is where you become a,163.04,4.229,167.269,neutral
type-2 diabetic and so for and so on so,164.45,4.8,169.25,neutral
when doing the ketogenic diet one thing,167.269,3.451,170.72,neutral
that I want to reassure my patients is,169.25,3.93,173.18,sad
that you're by you probably still miss,170.72,5.58,176.3,sad
insulin resistant mode okay,173.18,5.61,178.79000000000002,neutral
it will subside it will it will take it,176.3,4.14,180.44,neutral
does take time okay,178.79,3.96,182.75,neutral
so possible high-gluten the reason why,180.44,4.32,184.76,NA
you passe have high blood sugar is,182.75,4.02,186.77,neutral
because excess amount of if you took an,184.76,3.78,188.54,sad
excess amount of protein the night,186.77,3.75,190.52,sad
before and you test your blood sugar the,188.54,4.11,192.65,NA
next morning sure you may have increased,190.52,4.17,194.69,NA
sugar because excess amounts of proteins,192.65,4.56,197.21,neutral
what can't convert to have an insulin,194.69,3.99,198.68,neutral
spike okay,197.21,4.29,201.5,sad
also you may have had too many frequent,198.68,5.01,203.69,sad
meals if you have too many frequent,201.5,4.56,206.06,neutral
meals if you're starving yourself and,203.69,4.14,207.82999999999998,neutral
you have too many frequent meals yes,206.06,3.63,209.69,neutral
you're going to have it's going to spike,207.83,3.78,211.61,neutral
the system you're going to have spikes,209.69,5.73,215.42,neutral
and insulin and blood sugar if your,211.61,5.55,217.16000000000003,neutral
body's not used to it remember you have,215.42,5.04,220.45999999999998,neutral
to slowly adapt to it also very,217.16,6.51,223.67,NA
important high cortisol cortisol is a,220.46,5.76,226.22,NA
stress hormone when released cortisol,223.67,3.9,227.57,NA
again it's a blood sugar,226.22,4.95,231.17,neutral
okay our glucose level increases when,227.57,4.86,232.43,neutral
were these cortisol one the function of,231.17,4.17,235.33999999999997,neutral
cortisol is to increase blood sugar okay,232.43,5.18,237.61,NA
and it peaks at 8 o'clock in the morning,235.34,5.55,240.89000000000001,neutral
Glu cortisol typically Peaks about a,237.61,5.53,243.14000000000001,neutral
half an hour after we wake and then it's,240.89,4.62,245.51,neutral
going to let then stabilize however,243.14,5.7,248.83999999999997,neutral
though in times of stress it may peak,245.51,5.28,250.79,neutral
and it may peak longer so when you take,248.84,3.69,252.53,neutral
your blood glucose levels yes you may,250.79,4.71,255.5,neutral
have high blood sugar at that at that,252.53,5.97,258.5,neutral
point in time so I always want to sure,255.5,4.77,260.27,neutral
reassure my patients who are doing keto,258.5,4.26,262.76,neutral
the key genic diet it's gonna take time,260.27,4.68,264.95,neutral
to level off because your body's not,262.76,5.76,268.52,neutral
used to this so what can you do 200 what,264.95,5.31,270.26,neutral
can you do look at what's the process,268.52,3.87,272.39,neutral
how can you help yourself faster for one,270.26,4.59,274.84999999999997,neutral
again lower the carbohydrates when you,272.39,4.41,276.8,NA
don't eat game carbohydrates you don't,274.85,4.92,279.77000000000004,neutral
have an insulin response also to,276.8,6.33,283.13,neutral
exercise when we exercise it's going to,279.77,6.12,285.89,neutral
help stabilize our blood sugar due to,283.13,5.87,289.0,neutral
the mechanism of exercise on the body,285.89,6.86,292.75,neutral
sleep try to get sleep when we sleep our,289.0,6.88,295.88,neutral
body repairs itself while we're sleep,292.75,7.24,299.99,neutral
and try to get good sound sleep try to,295.88,6.45,302.33,sad
decrease our stress levels okay because,299.99,4.53,304.52,NA
again the high cortisol will increase,302.33,4.23,306.56,NA
the blood sugar now with decreased,304.52,3.57,308.09,neutral
stress levels you may want to take in,306.56,3.48,310.04,neutral
I've done previous videos,308.09,4.88,312.96999999999997,neutral
the adaptogens like ashwagandha,310.04,5.22,315.26000000000005,neutral
ashwagandha is phenomenal of damage in,312.97,6.3,319.27000000000004,neutral
which will help our body adapt to stress,315.26,8.34,323.59999999999997,neutral
all stupit aciem we need 4700 milligrams,319.27,7.27,326.53999999999996,neutral
of at ounce in a day 1500 milligrams of,323.6,7.02,330.62,neutral
sodium potassium relaxes the body also,326.54,7.86,334.40000000000003,neutral
to vitamin b1 vitamin b1 200 milligrams,330.62,5.04,335.66,NA
first thing in the morning it's going to,334.4,2.67,337.07,neutral
help with the cell mitochondria to,335.66,3.39,339.05,neutral
produce more cellular energy which will,337.07,4.23,341.3,neutral
help level eyes and stabilize our blood,339.05,5.46,344.51,neutral
glucose levels ok so again if you have,341.3,5.85,347.15000000000003,neutral
high blood sugar spikes with it on the,344.51,3.9,348.40999999999997,neutral
ketogenic diet I always tell my patients,347.15,3.96,351.10999999999996,neutral
it's going to be ok your body just has,348.41,3.87,352.28000000000003,neutral
to adapt to it,351.11,3.54,354.65000000000003,neutral
