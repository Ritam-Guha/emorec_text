here the stay Mia McNamara global medical news network at the skin disease Education Foundation women's and pediatric dermatology seminar in San Francisco and with me is dr. Jeffrey P,0.0,19.409,19.409,NA
Callen of the University of Louisville in Kentucky my first question is how did you learn about the growing connection between insulin resistance and they can't doses in Agra can that you're,9.809,20.762,30.570999999999998,angry
talking about during a presentation and it was clear that there were patients who had a can ptosis narcan's that was seemingly not related to any measurable endocrine appa the-- other than their,19.65,26.519,46.169,angry
being overweight and at that time in the mid seventies it was called pseudo acanthosis nigricans subsequently it's been recognized that most of the patients who had that entity would also,32.759,27.531000000000002,60.290000000000006,angry
be when tested would be able to demonstrate that they had insulin resistance and so probably their insulin resistance was also related to the to a reason for them being obese and then on,46.61,25.569000000000003,72.179,angry
top of it it allowed them to get a can't doses nagger cans so is this connection widely known among dermatologists well it's yeah I've been talking about it for probably the last four or five years so,59.55,22.411,81.961,angry
I would hope so you know what the number of meetings I go to but I think it sometimes is a very subtle finding when you're doing an examination particularly in in the the case that I was going to,71.1,24.69,95.78999999999999,angry
use to introduce the subject was a young woman who was being seen for acne who's overweight she has really had no menstrual irregularities but she probably does have polycystic ovarian,83.4,25.259,108.659,angry
syndrome which is also related to the presence of insulin resistance and and basically the reason that we were alerted to the fact that she was probably insulin resistant was that,95.369,25.770000000000003,121.13900000000001,angry
doing her complete examination we noticed a velvety discoloration on the back of her neck and folded area of the skin and so made the diagnosis of a cantos entire kans learner in her,108.659,24.179000000000002,132.83800000000002,angry
physician that this was a possibility she was tested I don't think that we as dermatologists though we're going to be treating the patients I think we're going to alert the patient and the fan,119.909,22.082,141.991,angry
and then alert the primary care providers whether it's a pediatrician or whether it's a adolescent medicine physician or an internist or a family physician that they ought to do the,130.92,25.14,156.06,angry
appropriate testing kind of your take-home message about this what you would tell the dermatologist when looking for this I mean they're obviously going to see they can't focus,144.81,17.130000000000003,161.94,angry
agra cans maybe they would be the ones who see that and then they would refer them possibly to someone else to manage insulin resistance is that true of those both ways yeah I think so I mean,152.97,19.409999999999997,172.38,angry
somebody may the patient may be sent because people either they may come rather than may be sent because they've noticed this hyper pigmentation and folded areas of the skin whether the,162.27,19.28,181.55,angry
back of the neck under the arms and then us making a proprietary clinical diagnosis you don't really need to do histopathology and then alerting the physician to do the appropriate testing,171.9,26.71,198.61,angry
including testing for insulin resistance but for other endocrine disorders this has been Damien McNamara with Lowell medical news network,185.55,15.88,201.43,angry
