medical news network at the skin disease,1.709,3.9,5.609,NA
Education Foundation women's and,3.75,3.629,7.379,NA
pediatric dermatology seminar in San,5.609,4.2,9.809000000000001,NA
Francisco and with me is dr. Jeffrey P,7.379,3.93,11.309,NA
Callen of the University of Louisville,9.809,4.74,14.549,angry
in Kentucky my first question is how did,11.309,4.711,16.02,angry
you learn about the growing connection,14.549,3.691,18.24,angry
between insulin resistance and they,16.02,3.63,19.65,angry
can't doses in Agra can that you're,18.24,3.99,22.229999999999997,angry
talking about during a presentation and,19.65,4.08,23.729999999999997,angry
it was clear that there were patients,22.23,4.74,26.97,angry
who had a can ptosis narcan's that was,23.73,6.33,30.060000000000002,angry
seemingly not related to any measurable,26.97,5.789,32.759,angry
endocrine appa the-- other than their,30.06,5.58,35.64,angry
being overweight and at that time in the,32.759,5.341,38.1,angry
mid seventies it was called pseudo,35.64,5.579,41.219,angry
acanthosis nigricans subsequently it's,38.1,4.889,42.989000000000004,angry
been recognized that most of the,41.219,5.391,46.61,angry
patients who had that entity would also,42.989,6.331,49.32,angry
be when tested would be able to,46.61,4.09,50.7,angry
demonstrate that they had insulin,49.32,4.2,53.52,angry
resistance and so probably their insulin,50.7,5.73,56.43000000000001,angry
resistance was also related to the to a,53.52,6.03,59.550000000000004,angry
reason for them being obese and then on,56.43,5.519,61.949,angry
top of it it allowed them to get a can't,59.55,5.009,64.559,angry
doses nagger cans so is this connection,61.949,5.551,67.5,angry
widely known among dermatologists well,64.559,4.531,69.09,angry
it's yeah I've been talking about it for,67.5,3.6,71.1,angry
probably the last four or five years so,69.09,3.72,72.81,angry
I would hope so you know what the number,71.1,4.32,75.41999999999999,angry
of meetings I go to but I think it,72.81,4.62,77.43,angry
sometimes is a very subtle finding when,75.42,4.199,79.619,angry
you're doing an examination particularly,77.43,5.97,83.4,angry
in in the the case that I was going to,79.619,5.581,85.2,angry
use to introduce the subject was a young,83.4,4.829,88.229,angry
woman who was being seen for acne who's,85.2,5.43,90.63,angry
overweight she has really had no,88.229,4.951,93.17999999999999,angry
menstrual irregularities but she,90.63,4.739,95.369,angry
probably does have polycystic ovarian,93.18,5.31,98.49000000000001,angry
syndrome which is also related to the,95.369,7.521,102.89,angry
presence of insulin resistance and and,98.49,6.419,104.90899999999999,angry
basically the reason that we were,102.89,3.369,106.259,angry
alerted to the fact that she was,104.909,3.75,108.659,angry
probably insulin resistant was that,106.259,4.711,110.97,angry
doing her complete examination we,108.659,5.1,113.759,angry
noticed a velvety discoloration on the,110.97,4.89,115.86,angry
back of her neck and folded area of the,113.759,3.9,117.659,angry
skin and so made the diagnosis of a,115.86,4.049,119.909,angry
cantos entire kans learner in her,117.659,6.24,123.899,angry
physician that this was a possibility,119.909,6.541,126.45,angry
she was tested I don't think that we as,123.899,3.75,127.649,angry
dermatologists though we're going to be,126.45,2.46,128.91,angry
treating the patients I think we're,127.649,3.271,130.92,surprise
going to alert the patient and the fan,128.91,6.06,134.97,angry
and then alert the primary care,130.92,6.81,137.73,angry
providers whether it's a pediatrician or,134.97,4.62,139.59,angry
whether it's a adolescent medicine,137.73,4.26,141.98999999999998,angry
physician or an internist or a family,139.59,5.22,144.81,angry
physician that they ought to do the,141.99,4.23,146.22,angry
appropriate testing kind of your,144.81,2.91,147.72,angry
take-home message about this what you,146.22,2.91,149.13,angry
would tell the dermatologist,147.72,3.48,151.2,angry
when looking for this I mean they're,149.13,3.84,152.97,angry
obviously going to see they can't focus,151.2,3.99,155.19,angry
agra cans maybe they would be the ones,152.97,3.63,156.6,angry
who see that and then they would refer,155.19,3.63,158.82,angry
them possibly to someone else to manage,156.6,3.96,160.56,angry
insulin resistance is that true of those,158.82,3.45,162.26999999999998,angry
both ways yeah I think so I mean,160.56,4.74,165.3,angry
somebody may the patient may be sent,162.27,5.13,167.4,angry
because people either they may come,165.3,3.36,168.66000000000003,angry
rather than may be sent because they've,167.4,2.91,170.31,angry
noticed this hyper pigmentation and,168.66,3.24,171.9,angry
folded areas of the skin whether the,170.31,4.64,174.95,angry
back of the neck under the arms and then,171.9,7.02,178.92000000000002,angry
us making a proprietary clinical,174.95,5.23,180.17999999999998,angry
diagnosis you don't really need to do,178.92,4.5,183.42,angry
histopathology and then alerting the,180.18,5.37,185.55,sad
physician to do the appropriate testing,183.42,4.59,188.01,angry
including testing for insulin resistance,185.55,4.77,190.32000000000002,angry
but for other endocrine disorders this,188.01,3.81,191.82,NA
