my name is dr. Jenny Wiggly I'm a GP,3.65,4.93,8.58,neutral
working in the NHS and I specialize in,6.54,4.65,11.190000000000001,neutral
dermatology I'm here today to talk to,8.58,5.4,13.98,neutral
you about cellulitis cellulitis is an,11.19,6.48,17.67,neutral
infection of the skin normally it occurs,13.98,6.299,20.279,neutral
in the lower legs but it can also occur,17.67,5.13,22.8,neutral
in the arms as well sometimes it occurs,20.279,6.99,27.269,neutral
because an infected bite sometimes it,22.8,7.77,30.57,neutral
occurs because of a break in the skin so,27.269,5.761,33.03,neutral
people who are risk of cellulitis are,30.57,4.38,34.95,neutral
diabetics they have a reduced immune,33.03,3.93,36.96,neutral
system or any other person who has,34.95,4.679,39.629000000000005,neutral
reduced immune system actually so anemia,36.96,5.79,42.75,neutral
or iron deficiency on medication which,39.629,4.531,44.16,neutral
reduces the immune system such as,42.75,4.559,47.309,neutral
steroids so all those people are risk of,44.16,4.71,48.87,neutral
cellulitis just because they've got,47.309,3.09,50.399,neutral
reduced immune system so they can't,48.87,5.189,54.059,neutral
fight off any bugs that come in to come,50.399,4.5,54.899,neutral
into the skin,54.059,4.441,58.5,neutral
I'm also anyone who's got dry skin so,54.899,5.881,60.78,neutral
that also includes diabetics got dry,58.5,4.739,63.239,neutral
thick skin in the feet and the lower,60.78,3.8,64.58,neutral
part of the baek's,63.239,4.471,67.71,neutral
that will that actually means that the,64.58,5.71,70.28999999999999,neutral
skin barrier is weaker so allow us,67.71,5.88,73.58999999999999,neutral
usually staph aureus which is the bug,70.29,5.579,75.869,neutral
that gets into the skin and causes,73.59,6.51,80.10000000000001,neutral
infection so staph aureus is normally,75.869,6.781,82.65,neutral
colonized in the skin surface it doesn't,80.1,4.68,84.78,neutral
normally cause any harm about ten ten to,82.65,3.68,86.33000000000001,neutral
twenty percent of people are carriers,84.78,3.87,88.65,neutral
but it's just when it gets into the skin,86.33,4.06,90.39,neutral
where it's not meant to be that's when,88.65,4.109,92.759,neutral
it can cause problems so you do need to,90.39,4.47,94.86,neutral
be careful with hygiene keeping your,92.759,5.22,97.979,neutral
hands clean washing every day with soap,94.86,6.09,100.95,neutral
that sort of thing antiseptic lotions,97.979,7.491,105.47,neutral
and washers if you're at risk so,100.95,8.3,109.25,neutral
symptoms of cellulitis are redness pain,105.47,9.16,114.63,neutral
hot skin to touch swelling a very shiny,109.25,8.409,117.659,neutral
skin normally in the in the lower legs,114.63,6.66,121.28999999999999,neutral
or the hands or arms it can progress,117.659,4.621,122.28,neutral
quite quickly,121.29,3.18,124.47000000000001,neutral
matter of day see do you need to see,122.28,4.56,126.84,neutral
your GP especially few at risk and you,124.47,4.14,128.60999999999999,neutral
GP will then give you some antibiotics,126.84,3.419,130.25900000000001,happy
usually something called flucloxacillin,128.61,4.02,132.63000000000002,NA
which is penicillin base so if you're,130.259,3.361,133.61999999999998,NA
allergic to that they'll give you,132.63,3.36,135.99,NA
something else instead and if that,133.62,5.28,138.9,NA
doesn't help then you might need to go,135.99,5.04,141.03,NA
up to the hospital for intravenous,138.9,4.98,143.88,NA
antibiotics but it is a condition,141.03,5.28,146.31,NA
whereby if you are worried about it you,143.88,5.16,149.04,NA
must see your GP as soon as possible so,146.31,4.53,150.84,NA
I hope this has been useful and thank,149.04,4.669,153.709,NA
you for listening to me,150.84,2.869,153.709,NA
