"today we're going to talk about how to reverse 
a condition called acanthosis nigricans okay now   what is that that's a situation where you have 
this gray brown hyperpigmentation it's kind of   a darkening on the back of your neck on the side 
of the neck on the armpits it could be in certain   other places but it has a kind of a velvety 
texture to it and it's symmetrical which means   it's on both sides okay or both armpits now it's 
associated with diabetes pcos polycystic ovarian  ",0.16,32.88,33.04,angry
"syndrome cushing's syndrome which is high cortisol 
and metabolic disease okay now if you look it   up in wikipedia it'll say that the majority of 
cases are idiopathic this is a very fancy word   for i don't know what's causing it okay unknown 
cause but this condition is primarily caused by   excessive amount of insulin okay hyper 
insulin anemia too much insulin in the blood   and parallel with that you have insulin 
resistance so these go hand in hand  ",33.04,34.32,67.36,NA
"if you have insulin resistance your body will then 
make more insulin so you're going to have too much   insulin and that's what's creating this right here 
and that's why it's associated with diabetes pcos   cushing's and metabolic syndrome you can call it 
disease if you want but this is what's behind all   these right here now if you look at what wikipedia 
says about hyperinsulinemia what causes that   it lists tumor carb malabsorption which i'm not 
sure exactly what that means pancreatic cancer  ",69.36,30.88,100.24,NA
"pcos trans fats what are they missing 
they're missing the primary cause okay   eating too many carbs i find it very very 
interesting that the actual root cause   of hyperinsulinemia is not even on the page 
and so when people read this or study this   they're going to go oh maybe i should go to the 
doctor and get a mri or a cat scan and make sure   i don't have a tumor or maybe i should go to a 
gi doctor to see if i have carb malabsorption  ",100.96,29.839999999999996,130.79999999999998,NA
"or maybe an oncologist to see if i have pancreatic 
cancer or a fertility doctor to see if i have pcos   and so you have all these different specialists 
which have their own specialized knowledge   but unfortunately a lot of times they don't look 
at the whole picture and the common thread that is   throughout all of these conditions right here 
and this is it right here so very simply what   you need to do if you have this condition is 
lower the amount of carbs in your diet that's  ",130.8,27.440000000000005,158.24,NA
