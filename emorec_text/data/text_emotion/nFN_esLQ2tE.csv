hello i'm dr mita ratan and this channel,0.08,4.4,4.48,fear
is dedicated to skin careful skin,2.159,4.561,6.72,fear
of color as you know i'm a doctor but,4.48,3.84,8.32,fear
i'm also a cosmetic formulator,6.72,3.839,10.559,surprise
specifically for skin of color,8.32,4.88,13.2,surprise
so today's video is all about acanthosis,10.559,4.401,14.959999999999999,happy
 cans it's something that really,13.2,3.68,16.88,NA
does affect the skin of color community,14.96,4.72,19.68,NA
but we don't discuss it enough as with,16.88,4.479,21.358999999999998,fear
many of the topics when it comes to skin,19.68,2.0,21.68,fear
care,21.359,1.92,23.279000000000003,fear
when people would come into my clinic,21.68,3.599,25.279,fear
for pigmentation and they would have,23.279,4.24,27.519,fear
darker necks or dark darker under the,25.279,4.4,29.679000000000002,fear
arms they would think it was purely a,27.519,3.76,31.278999999999996,fear
pigmentation issue when,29.679,3.681,33.36,surprise
actually there was more going on so,31.279,4.001,35.28,happy
today's video is really addressing it,33.36,4.24,37.6,fear
how do we treat it uh what really is,35.28,3.76,39.04,fear
going on with the skin if that sounds,37.6,2.72,40.32,fear
good to you give me a thumbs up let's,39.04,6.8,45.839999999999996,NA
dive right in,40.32,5.52,45.84,NA
so what it looks like is thickened,52.64,4.32,56.96,fear
velvety skin that's how we describe it,54.719,3.761,58.480000000000004,fear
and you typically see it at the back of,56.96,3.52,60.480000000000004,fear
the neck under the arms in the groin,58.48,3.68,62.16,fear
area and at the back of the knees,60.48,4.56,65.03999999999999,fear
acanthus cans is also associated,62.16,5.36,67.52,fear
with diabetes and with obesity which is,65.04,4.24,69.28,fear
why it's becoming more prevalent,67.52,3.36,70.88,surprise
in our skin of color communities,69.28,3.6,72.88,surprise
especially as our diet is changing,70.88,4.16,75.03999999999999,surprise
towards more of a western diet so what,72.88,4.0,76.88,fear
actually is happening to our skin,75.04,4.64,79.68,fear
so what happens is between the epidermis,76.88,4.72,81.6,fear
and dermis we have the basal layer,79.68,4.079,83.759,fear
that's where the melanocytes live,81.6,5.199,86.79899999999999,fear
and what happens is insulin basically,83.759,5.201,88.96,fear
goes through passes through the basal,86.799,3.68,90.47900000000001,surprise
layer and,88.96,3.68,92.64,fear
will meet with keratinocytes in the,90.479,3.121,93.6,fear
epidermis,92.64,2.479,95.119,fear
insulin will bind with these,93.6,4.0,97.6,fear
insulin-like growth factor receptors,95.119,4.921,100.04,fear
they will stimulate fibroblasts and,97.6,3.839,101.439,fear
keratinocytes,100.04,4.119,104.159,fear
and this will lead to thickened velvety,101.439,3.121,104.55999999999999,fear
skin,104.159,3.28,107.43900000000001,fear
now the most common cause of acanthosis,104.56,3.919,108.479,fear
micro cans is,107.439,4.081,111.52,fear
obesity 50 of those who wear,108.479,4.881,113.36,fear
weigh more than double their recommended,111.52,3.2,114.72,fear
weight will get,113.36,4.079,117.439,fear
acanthus cans so the number one,114.72,4.399,119.119,fear
thing that you need to do to treat this,117.439,5.36,122.79899999999999,fear
is to lose weight because you want to,119.119,6.64,125.759,fear
increase sensitivity of insulin which,122.799,4.081,126.88000000000001,fear
means that you have less,125.759,3.601,129.36,fear
insulin than flooding the system this is,126.88,3.519,130.399,fear
really important,129.36,3.2,132.56,fear
it's instrumental to break this vicious,130.399,3.441,133.84,happy
cycle that's taking place,132.56,2.96,135.52,happy
additional things that you can do are,133.84,3.2,137.04,surprise
either oral or,135.52,3.92,139.44,surprise
topical vitamin a so retinoids because,137.04,3.839,140.879,surprise
that what that does is helps,139.44,3.519,142.959,neutral
increase cell turnover you can use,140.879,3.041,143.92,neutral
gentle peels,142.959,3.441,146.4,fear
such as mandelic acid but until you,143.92,4.16,148.07999999999998,fear
treat the root cause you're going to be,146.4,3.919,150.31900000000002,fear
getting temporary results at best,148.08,4.159,152.239,fear
in addition any tyrosinase inhibitors,150.319,3.92,154.23899999999998,fear
that you use are going to struggle,152.239,3.681,155.92000000000002,fear
to get through the thickened skin in,154.239,3.441,157.68,fear
order to reach the basal layer where the,155.92,2.959,158.879,fear
melanocytes live,157.68,3.44,161.12,fear
one thing i would say to avoid are,158.879,4.241,163.12,fear
lasers for skin of color to try and,161.12,3.839,164.959,fear
treat this pigmentation because,163.12,3.68,166.8,fear
you can burn the skin and get more,164.959,4.56,169.519,fear
pigmentation it's just not even worth,166.8,4.4,171.20000000000002,fear
the wrist profile isn't worth it for,169.519,3.601,173.12,fear
skin of color so the routine i would,171.2,2.399,173.599,happy
give you,173.12,2.32,175.44,fear
is when you wash first in the morning,173.599,3.241,176.84,fear
make sure you're using a,175.44,2.56,178.0,fear
non-inflammatory,176.84,2.679,179.519,fear
product so something with no fragrance,178.0,3.519,181.519,fear
in it that's hypoallergenic,179.519,4.161,183.68,fear
hypoallergenic so you do that first and,181.519,2.72,184.239,fear
then,183.68,2.96,186.64000000000001,fear
i would apply either moisturizers such,184.239,4.241,188.48000000000002,fear
as citrobin or cerave,186.64,3.519,190.159,happy
and then apply your sunscreen especially,188.48,3.6,192.07999999999998,happy
if you've got if you're exposing it to,190.159,2.561,192.72,happy
uv,192.08,3.2,195.28,fear
so i would recommend that you go with,192.72,3.04,195.76,fear
them,195.28,3.599,198.879,fear
with zinc oxide mineral sunscreen just,195.76,3.92,199.67999999999998,fear
because,198.879,3.121,202.0,fear
it's anti-inflammatory too which you,199.68,3.04,202.72,fear
really,202.0,2.48,204.48,fear
are trying to soothe the skin as much as,202.72,4.079,206.799,fear
possible with acanthosis niagara cans,204.48,3.839,208.319,fear
at night time if you want to try a,206.799,3.601,210.4,fear
retinol then what i would recommend,208.319,4.56,212.879,happy
is wash under the arms and around the,210.4,3.199,213.59900000000002,fear
neck area,212.879,3.841,216.72,fear
apply 0.5 percent retinol from,213.599,5.761,219.35999999999999,fear
the ordinary or try 0.3 percent from,216.72,3.519,220.239,fear
paula's choice,219.36,3.36,222.72000000000003,fear
you could potentially go up a little bit,220.239,3.92,224.159,fear
higher in terms of strength,222.72,4.079,226.799,fear
but i would start off carefully because,224.159,4.16,228.319,fear
i don't want you to be getting,226.799,3.201,230.0,fear
to it to irritate the skin and then get,228.319,4.56,232.879,fear
more pigmentation so start off at 0.5,230.0,3.519,233.519,fear
percent,232.879,3.121,236.0,fear
or the 0.3 from paula's choice so you,233.519,3.521,237.04,fear
moisturize first,236.0,2.959,238.959,happy
then the retinol and then moisturize,237.04,3.919,240.959,happy
again that's called the retinol sandwich,238.959,3.681,242.64000000000001,fear
alternatively if you decide i just want,240.959,3.28,244.239,fear
to treat the pigmentation,242.64,4.08,246.72,fear
then go straight in with your tyrosinase,244.239,3.28,247.519,fear
inhibitors,246.72,3.28,250.0,fear
so don't moisturize wash have clean skin,247.519,4.0,251.519,fear
and then pop on the tyrosinase,250.0,2.72,252.72,neutral
inhibitors because you want to get,251.519,3.041,254.56,happy
maximum penetration of those actives,252.72,3.6,256.32,fear
into the skin so things like,254.56,3.44,258.0,fear
alpha arbutin from the ordinary is very,256.32,4.159,260.479,happy
good or niacinamide many different,258.0,4.16,262.16,fear
brands now do niacinamide the other good,260.479,3.121,263.59999999999997,fear
one is tranexamic acid,262.16,2.8,264.96000000000004,fear
at the inky list that's a really good,263.6,3.039,266.639,fear
one and then you can moisturize,264.96,3.36,268.32,fear
you do that for about three to six,266.639,3.521,270.16,fear
months if you're seeing results great,268.32,3.52,271.84,happy
if you decide you need to upgrade then,270.16,4.479,274.639,fear
you can always use the dr v,271.84,4.96,276.79999999999995,fear
body pigmentation kit which has got 10,274.639,4.881,279.52,fear
tyrosinase inhibitors in them,276.8,5.52,282.32,fear
often with skin of color our melanocytes,279.52,4.56,284.08,fear
are very difficult to treat,282.32,4.319,286.639,fear
and one or two actives isn't going to be,284.08,4.559,288.639,fear
enough regardless even if you're using,286.639,3.761,290.40000000000003,fear
the body pigmentation kit you are going,288.639,3.681,292.32,fear
to have to get the glucose under control,290.4,3.76,294.15999999999997,fear
otherwise no matter what you do is going,292.32,3.439,295.759,fear
to be temporary you know it's really,294.16,2.96,297.12,fear
important to do that i don't want to,295.759,2.801,298.56,fear
waste your money with anybody,297.12,3.519,300.639,neutral
so just for your own knowledge the 10,298.56,3.44,302.0,neutral
tyrosines inhibitors,300.639,3.441,304.08,fear
