hello i'm dr mita ratan and this channel is dedicated to skin careful skin of color as you know i'm a doctor but i'm also a cosmetic formulator specifically for skin of color,0.08,21.52,21.599999999999998,sad
so today's video is all about acanthosis  cans it's something that really does affect the skin of color community but we don't discuss it enough as with many of the topics when it comes to skin,10.559,19.279999999999998,29.839,NA
care when people would come into my clinic for pigmentation and they would have darker necks or dark darker under the arms they would think it was purely a,21.359,17.919,39.278000000000006,sad
pigmentation issue when actually there was more going on so today's video is really addressing it how do we treat it uh what really is going on with the skin if that sounds,29.679,18.402,48.081,sad
good to you give me a thumbs up let's dive right in so what it looks like is thickened velvety skin that's how we describe it and you typically see it at the back of,39.04,23.921,62.961,sad
the neck under the arms in the groin area and at the back of the knees acanthus cans is also associated with diabetes and with obesity which is why it's becoming more prevalent,58.48,21.200000000000003,79.68,sad
in our skin of color communities especially as our diet is changing towards more of a western diet so what actually is happening to our skin so what happens is between the epidermis,69.28,21.119999999999997,90.4,sad
and dermis we have the basal layer that's where the melanocytes live and what happens is insulin basically goes through passes through the basal layer and,79.68,21.839,101.519,sad
will meet with keratinocytes in the epidermis insulin will bind with these insulin-like growth factor receptors they will stimulate fibroblasts and,90.479,18.36,108.839,sad
keratinocytes and this will lead to thickened velvety skin now the most common cause of acanthosis micro cans is,100.04,18.52,118.56,sad
obesity 50 of those who wear weigh more than double their recommended weight will get acanthus cans so the number one thing that you need to do to treat this,108.479,21.919,130.398,sad
is to lose weight because you want to increase sensitivity of insulin which means that you have less insulin than flooding the system this is really important,119.119,21.041,140.16,sad
it's instrumental to break this vicious cycle that's taking place additional things that you can do are either oral or topical vitamin a so retinoids because,130.399,17.36,147.75900000000001,sad
that what that does is helps increase cell turnover you can use gentle peels such as mandelic acid but until you treat the root cause you're going to be,139.44,18.080000000000002,157.52,sad
getting temporary results at best in addition any tyrosinase inhibitors that you use are going to struggle to get through the thickened skin in order to reach the basal layer where the,148.08,18.16,166.24,sad
melanocytes live one thing i would say to avoid are lasers for skin of color to try and treat this pigmentation because you can burn the skin and get more,157.68,19.759999999999998,177.44,sad
pigmentation it's just not even worth the wrist profile isn't worth it for skin of color so the routine i would give you is when you wash first in the morning,166.8,15.961000000000002,182.76100000000002,sad
make sure you're using a non-inflammatory product so something with no fragrance in it that's hypoallergenic hypoallergenic so you do that first and,175.44,15.639,191.079,sad
then i would apply either moisturizers such as citrobin or cerave and then apply your sunscreen especially if you've got if you're exposing it to,183.68,16.881,200.561,sad
uv so i would recommend that you go with them with zinc oxide mineral sunscreen just because,192.08,16.88,208.96,sad
it's anti-inflammatory too which you really are trying to soothe the skin as much as possible with acanthosis niagara cans at night time if you want to try a,199.68,17.039,216.719,sad
retinol then what i would recommend is wash under the arms and around the neck area apply 0.5 percent retinol from the ordinary or try 0.3 percent from,208.319,20.880000000000003,229.19899999999998,sad
paula's choice you could potentially go up a little bit higher in terms of strength but i would start off carefully because i don't want you to be getting,219.36,18.72,238.08,sad
to it to irritate the skin and then get more pigmentation so start off at 0.5 percent or the 0.3 from paula's choice so you moisturize first,228.319,17.68,245.999,sad
then the retinol and then moisturize again that's called the retinol sandwich alternatively if you decide i just want to treat the pigmentation then go straight in with your tyrosinase,237.04,18.24,255.28,sad
inhibitors so don't moisturize wash have clean skin and then pop on the tyrosinase inhibitors because you want to get maximum penetration of those actives,246.72,16.641000000000002,263.361,sad
into the skin so things like alpha arbutin from the ordinary is very good or niacinamide many different brands now do niacinamide the other good one is tranexamic acid,254.56,17.68,272.24,sad
at the inky list that's a really good one and then you can moisturize you do that for about three to six months if you're seeing results great if you decide you need to upgrade then,263.6,17.919,281.519,sad
you can always use the dr v body pigmentation kit which has got 10 tyrosinase inhibitors in them often with skin of color our melanocytes are very difficult to treat,271.84,24.24,296.08,sad
and one or two actives isn't going to be enough regardless even if you're using the body pigmentation kit you are going to have to get the glucose under control otherwise no matter what you do is going,284.08,19.200000000000003,303.28,sad
to be temporary you know it's really important to do that i don't want to waste your money with anybody so just for your own knowledge the 10 tyrosines inhibitors,294.16,16.161,310.321,sad
in the dr v body pigmentation kit the skin of color are alpha rb10 vitamin c uh water soluble sodium scuba phosphate fat soluble tetrahexal dichloroscorbate and acetyl glucosamine dioric acid uh,302.0,25.279000000000003,327.279,sad
salicylic acid kojic dipalmate licorice extract three forms of vitamin a that's retinol retinaldehyde and retinol palmitate plus your vitamin e just so that you are,314.479,19.040999999999997,333.52,sad
