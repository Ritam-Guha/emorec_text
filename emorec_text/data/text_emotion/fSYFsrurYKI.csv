over a period of many, many months. When endocrinologists",60.0,7.39,67.39,NA

get diabetes were to look at first degree",80.79,6.67,87.46000000000001,NA

diabetes have a genetic predisposition, and",91.29,4.07,95.36000000000001,NA

is, but we understand that if you have that",101.729,5.491,107.22,NA

a child who is developing diabetes, we could",165.89,6.15,172.04,fear

that even though she didn't know she was on",172.04,4.79,176.82999999999998,NA

period, with the rare exception of a child",230.72,7.96,238.68,NA

rule, but it's a sociological reality that",238.68,7.35,246.03,NA

a mother, will be much more vigilant at checking",246.03,6.819,252.849,NA

again over the renal threshold of 180, you",271.21,6.63,277.84,NA

you'll get thirsty. And so you get polydipsia.",277.84,7.04,284.88,NA

thing, however, is that not all patients really",359.229,5.151,364.38,NA

it that they lose beta cell mass, a massive",385.93,6.54,392.47,NA

Monday to Tuesday, what changes is not their",410.16,5.14,415.3,NA

we get a little bit of hypovolemia, we will",463.819,4.88,468.699,NA

resistance. And so in somebody without diabetes,",481.28,6.06,487.34,NA
