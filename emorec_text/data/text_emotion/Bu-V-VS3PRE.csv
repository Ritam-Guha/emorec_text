so the earlier,2.48,4.0,6.48,fear
we intervene the more likely we are to,4.0,3.839,7.839,neutral
cure surgically,6.48,3.68,10.16,fear
so microadenomas have a very high rate,7.839,3.201,11.040000000000001,fear
of cure,10.16,2.88,13.04,fear
macroadenomas that are more invasive,11.04,3.28,14.319999999999999,neutral
have a lower likelihood of,13.04,3.76,16.799999999999997,neutral
cure so the surgery is usually the first,14.32,4.24,18.560000000000002,neutral
step as long as there's a tumor that's,16.8,3.04,19.84,neutral
identified,18.56,3.12,21.68,neutral
and a good surgeon is really important,19.84,3.359,23.198999999999998,neutral
so someone who has,21.68,3.839,25.519,neutral
great experience in a number of,23.199,6.24,29.439,neutral
pituitary surgeries would be ideal,25.519,5.92,31.439,neutral
after the surgery we have to re-evaluate,29.439,3.921,33.36,neutral
that patient to determine whether the,31.439,3.921,35.36,neutral
growth hormone excess is still there,33.36,3.52,36.88,fear
that can take a little time after the,35.36,3.519,38.879,fear
surgery you can check growth hormone,36.88,3.44,40.32,fear
right away in fact,38.879,3.36,42.239,fear
day one and day two post-op levels that,40.32,3.6,43.92,neutral
are lower are associated with the,42.239,2.401,44.64,neutral
likelihood of,43.92,2.799,46.719,neutral
cure but the real proof of the pudding,44.64,4.0,48.64,neutral
will come with the igf-1 level which has,46.719,2.721,49.44,neutral
to be done,48.64,3.36,52.0,neutral
six to 12 weeks after the surgery and if,49.44,4.0,53.44,neutral
that's normal that patient is in,52.0,3.039,55.039,neutral
remission and can be followed,53.44,3.599,57.039,neutral
if that's elevated or the growth hormone,55.039,3.761,58.800000000000004,neutral
is elevated or their symptoms are still,57.039,2.16,59.199,neutral
there,58.8,2.559,61.358999999999995,fear
along with elevated levels then medical,59.199,4.16,63.358999999999995,neutral
therapy is necessary and there's,61.359,3.681,65.04,neutral
many different medical therapies now,63.359,3.361,66.72,neutral
available,65.04,4.56,69.60000000000001,neutral
to treat uh persistent growth hormone,66.72,4.24,70.96,neutral
excess after surgical,69.6,2.879,72.479,neutral
failure we used to think that it was,70.96,3.44,74.39999999999999,neutral
just sporadic that there wasn't really,72.479,4.0,76.479,neutral
much genetics to acromegaly except in,74.4,3.68,78.08000000000001,neutral
rare syndromes but we're learning more,76.479,3.041,79.52,neutral
and more that there,78.08,4.64,82.72,neutral
that some of these cases can be familial,79.52,5.84,85.36,neutral
um the ones that we have the genes for,82.72,4.88,87.6,neutral
are complicated syndromes like multiple,85.36,4.24,89.6,neutral
endocrine neoplasia where there,87.6,4.24,91.83999999999999,neutral
are multiple endocrine tumors including,89.6,3.04,92.64,neutral
pancreatic,91.84,3.44,95.28,neutral
parathyroid and pituitary tumors and,92.64,4.24,96.88,neutral
they're not just acromegaly they can be,95.28,2.64,97.92,neutral
any of those,96.88,4.64,101.52,neutral
um cases and that's an men1 mutation,97.92,6.96,104.88,neutral
that occurs um straight through families,101.52,4.32,105.84,neutral
so they'll be,104.88,3.44,108.32,neutral
usually another family member involved,105.84,3.919,109.759,neutral
the patient could be the first one with,108.32,2.479,110.79899999999999,neutral
men1,109.759,4.081,113.84,neutral
and so if they have all more than one of,110.799,4.64,115.43900000000001,neutral
those endocrine tumors along with,113.84,3.36,117.2,neutral
acromegaly they should get tested for,115.439,2.881,118.32,neutral
men1,117.2,3.04,120.24000000000001,neutral
it's not usually found though and we,118.32,3.36,121.67999999999999,neutral
actually published a paper,120.24,3.28,123.52,neutral
very recently in the jcm looking at,121.68,3.479,125.159,neutral
patients with acromegaly and,123.52,3.52,127.03999999999999,neutral
hyperparathyroidism specifically for,125.159,3.24,128.399,neutral
men1,127.04,3.76,130.8,neutral
and all of our patients there were 22,128.399,4.241,132.64,neutral
that we described,130.8,4.96,135.76000000000002,neutral
were negative for the genetic testing,132.64,6.16,138.79999999999998,neutral
so um we this so there's other things,135.76,4.64,140.39999999999998,neutral
that explain these rare,138.8,3.28,142.08,neutral
cases of hyperparathyroidism and,140.4,3.28,143.68,neutral
acromegaly but if you,142.08,4.239,146.31900000000002,neutral
throw in a pancreatic tumor into the mix,143.68,5.199,148.87900000000002,neutral
then men1 becomes more likely or a third,146.319,4.64,150.95899999999997,neutral
tumor then it's likely to have the men1,148.879,2.72,151.599,neutral
other,150.959,3.681,154.64000000000001,neutral
genetic tests that can be done for cases,151.599,4.401,156.0,neutral
where there's more than one family,154.64,3.92,158.55999999999997,neutral
member involved as having acromegaly is,156.0,3.76,159.76,neutral
the aip,158.56,4.0,162.56,neutral
mutation the aryl hydrocarbon,159.76,5.119,164.879,neutral
interacting receptor protein mutation,162.56,3.84,166.4,neutral
which has been described in,164.879,5.201,170.07999999999998,neutral
familial cases of multiple pituitary,166.4,5.68,172.08,neutral
tumors in one family where you can have,170.08,3.6,173.68,neutral
more than one family member,172.08,3.76,175.84,neutral
that has a pituitary tumor and that type,173.68,4.24,177.92000000000002,neutral
of tumor is usually acromegaly so,175.84,5.2,181.04,neutral
if you have for example a parent and a,177.92,5.2,183.11999999999998,neutral
child or brother and sister,181.04,4.559,185.599,neutral
you you may have an aip mutation and,183.12,4.32,187.44,neutral
those usually will present at a younger,185.599,3.92,189.51899999999998,neutral
age of onset so they're more likely to,187.44,3.92,191.35999999999999,neutral
include patients that have gigantism,189.519,3.44,192.959,neutral
because they get the disease before,191.36,2.72,194.08,neutral
puberty,192.959,3.681,196.64000000000001,neutral
we're still learning about other genes,194.08,3.76,197.84,neutral
and trying to look for them when you,196.64,1.599,198.23899999999998,neutral
have,197.84,2.8,200.64000000000001,neutral
uh family members that have multiple,198.239,3.841,202.08,neutral
tumors,200.64,3.2,203.83999999999997,neutral
acromegaly and prolactinomas or,202.08,3.519,205.59900000000002,neutral
acromegaly and other non-functioning,203.84,3.679,207.519,neutral
pituitary tumors or just acromegaly that,205.599,4.321,209.92,neutral
don't have an aip mutation or an men1,207.519,3.28,210.799,neutral
mutation,209.92,2.8,212.72,neutral
and that don't have carni complex which,210.799,3.36,214.15900000000002,neutral
is the other gene involved,212.72,3.12,215.84,neutral
so there are a few rare genetic,214.159,4.08,218.239,neutral
syndromes that include multiple,215.84,5.6,221.44,neutral
endocrine tumors,218.239,5.681,223.92000000000002,neutral
some of them are just a pure familial,221.44,4.48,225.92,neutral
isolated pituitary adenomas syndrome,223.92,2.72,226.64,neutral
which is,225.92,3.599,229.51899999999998,fear
associated with aip mutations but all of,226.64,3.76,230.39999999999998,fear
those are rare,229.519,3.92,233.439,neutral
and the most common finding in a patient,230.4,4.559,234.959,neutral
with acromegaly is that they're the only,233.439,2.72,236.159,neutral
one in their families,234.959,2.801,237.76,neutral
that have known to have it and we don't,236.159,3.121,239.28,neutral
know the genetics involved,237.76,4.0,241.76,neutral
it's important i think to tell patients,239.28,3.519,242.799,neutral
that,241.76,3.44,245.2,neutral
they're not alone i think many,242.799,4.481,247.28,neutral
endocrinologists or primary care doctors,245.2,4.399,249.599,neutral
will have only one patient because it is,247.28,3.92,251.2,neutral
a rare disease and like all,249.599,3.761,253.35999999999999,neutral
rare diseases it can be a very lonely,251.2,4.48,255.67999999999998,neutral
feeling i would encourage um them,253.36,5.76,259.12,neutral
to get seen if they have you know any,255.68,4.72,260.40000000000003,neutral
residual disease at all,259.12,4.639,263.759,neutral
at a pituitary center one because these,260.4,4.72,265.12,neutral
these are going to be the physicians,263.759,3.201,266.96000000000004,neutral
that are most likely to be aware,265.12,4.799,269.919,neutral
of all the new available therapies but,266.96,3.44,270.4,neutral
also,269.919,3.921,273.84,neutral
they can then join in even in when we go,270.4,5.359,275.75899999999996,neutral
back to having live waiting rooms,273.84,4.56,278.4,neutral
um many other patients with acromegaly,275.759,3.281,279.04,neutral
and if not,278.4,3.359,281.75899999999996,neutral
there are online communities as well for,279.04,4.879,283.91900000000004,neutral
patients with acromegaly,281.759,4.321,286.08000000000004,neutral
so that you know they don't feel alone,283.919,3.601,287.52,fear
and i know a lot of our patients,286.08,3.04,289.12,fear
enjoy talking to other patients right in,287.52,3.2,290.71999999999997,neutral
our waiting room since we we specialize,289.12,2.88,292.0,neutral
in acromegaly and,290.72,2.8,293.52000000000004,neutral
in the days when we had patients in our,292.0,3.04,295.04,neutral
office they were able to chat,293.52,4.32,297.84,neutral
readily,295.04,2.8,297.84000000000003,neutral
