so the earlier we intervene the more likely we are to cure surgically so microadenomas have a very high rate of cure,2.48,17.6,20.080000000000002,sad
macroadenomas that are more invasive have a lower likelihood of cure so the surgery is usually the first step as long as there's a tumor that's identified,11.04,17.44,28.48,sad
and a good surgeon is really important so someone who has great experience in a number of pituitary surgeries would be ideal after the surgery we have to re-evaluate,19.84,23.279,43.119,sad
that patient to determine whether the growth hormone excess is still there that can take a little time after the surgery you can check growth hormone right away in fact,31.439,17.76,49.199,sad
day one and day two post-op levels that are lower are associated with the likelihood of cure but the real proof of the pudding will come with the igf-1 level which has,40.32,15.520999999999999,55.841,sad
to be done six to 12 weeks after the surgery and if that's normal that patient is in remission and can be followed if that's elevated or the growth hormone,48.64,17.759,66.399,sad
is elevated or their symptoms are still there along with elevated levels then medical therapy is necessary and there's many different medical therapies now,57.039,15.921000000000003,72.96000000000001,sad
available to treat uh persistent growth hormone excess after surgical failure we used to think that it was just sporadic that there wasn't really,65.04,19.119,84.159,sad
much genetics to acromegaly except in rare syndromes but we're learning more and more that there that some of these cases can be familial um the ones that we have the genes for,74.4,22.081,96.48100000000001,sad
are complicated syndromes like multiple endocrine neoplasia where there are multiple endocrine tumors including pancreatic parathyroid and pituitary tumors and,85.36,19.2,104.56,sad
they're not just acromegaly they can be any of those um cases and that's an men1 mutation that occurs um straight through families so they'll be,95.28,22.0,117.28,sad
usually another family member involved the patient could be the first one with men1 and so if they have all more than one of those endocrine tumors along with,105.84,18.479,124.319,sad
acromegaly they should get tested for men1 it's not usually found though and we actually published a paper very recently in the jcm looking at,115.439,16.04,131.47899999999998,sad
patients with acromegaly and hyperparathyroidism specifically for men1 and all of our patients there were 22 that we described,123.52,19.721,143.24099999999999,sad
were negative for the genetic testing so um we this so there's other things that explain these rare cases of hyperparathyroidism and acromegaly but if you,132.64,21.599,154.23899999999998,sad
throw in a pancreatic tumor into the mix then men1 becomes more likely or a third tumor then it's likely to have the men1 other genetic tests that can be done for cases,143.68,20.641,164.321,sad
where there's more than one family member involved as having acromegaly is the aip mutation the aryl hydrocarbon interacting receptor protein mutation,154.64,20.639,175.279,sad
which has been described in familial cases of multiple pituitary tumors in one family where you can have more than one family member that has a pituitary tumor and that type,164.879,22.481,187.35999999999999,sad
of tumor is usually acromegaly so if you have for example a parent and a child or brother and sister you you may have an aip mutation and those usually will present at a younger,175.84,23.198999999999998,199.039,sad
age of onset so they're more likely to include patients that have gigantism because they get the disease before puberty we're still learning about other genes,187.44,17.521,204.961,sad
and trying to look for them when you have uh family members that have multiple tumors acromegaly and prolactinomas or,196.64,14.959000000000001,211.599,sad
acromegaly and other non-functioning pituitary tumors or just acromegaly that don't have an aip mutation or an men1 mutation and that don't have carni complex which,203.84,17.439999999999998,221.28,sad
is the other gene involved so there are a few rare genetic syndromes that include multiple endocrine tumors some of them are just a pure familial,212.72,22.961000000000002,235.681,sad
isolated pituitary adenomas syndrome which is associated with aip mutations but all of those are rare and the most common finding in a patient,223.92,18.558,242.47799999999998,sad
with acromegaly is that they're the only one in their families that have known to have it and we don't know the genetics involved it's important i think to tell patients,233.439,16.161,249.6,sad
that they're not alone i think many endocrinologists or primary care doctors will have only one patient because it is a rare disease and like all,241.76,20.001,261.76099999999997,sad
rare diseases it can be a very lonely feeling i would encourage um them to get seen if they have you know any residual disease at all at a pituitary center one because these,251.2,24.319,275.519,sad
these are going to be the physicians that are most likely to be aware of all the new available therapies but also they can then join in even in when we go,263.759,20.72,284.47900000000004,sad
back to having live waiting rooms um many other patients with acromegaly and if not there are online communities as well for patients with acromegaly,273.84,20.4,294.23999999999995,sad
so that you know they don't feel alone and i know a lot of our patients enjoy talking to other patients right in our waiting room since we we specialize in acromegaly and,283.919,15.521,299.44,sad
in the days when we had patients in our office they were able to chat readily,292.0,10.16,302.16,NA
