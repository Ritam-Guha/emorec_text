you're looking at seven days of,19.47,4.049,23.519,
high-dose flucloxacillin and if they're,21.21,3.69,24.900000000000002,
allergic to penicillin you're thinking,23.519,3.75,27.269,
about clarithromycin as a second option,24.9,4.65,29.549999999999997,

flucloxacillin depending on the strength,47.28,5.549,52.829,
