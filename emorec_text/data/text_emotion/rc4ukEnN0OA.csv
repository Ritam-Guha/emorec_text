Metformin I see patients on this on a daily basis but in today's episode we're going to talk about how to start taking metformin to reduce its possible side effects now let me know how you're getting on by leaving a comment at the end of the video first a bit of background about metformin it's prescribed to treat type 2 diabetes and polycystic ovary syndrome which we call PCOS,0.0,22.200000000000003,22.200000000000003,sad
metformin lowers your sugar levels by reducing the amount of sugar that your liver releases into your blood and also improving your body's response to insulin now it's usually prescribed in type 2 diabetes when diet and exercise alone hasn't been enough to reduce your blood sugar levels for women with PCOS metformin stimulates ovulation even if you don't have diabetes,22.46,20.8,43.260000000000005,sad
"and it does this by lowering blood sugar levels and lowering insulin background done! I've always found metformin to be a very interesting drug because not only does it help with PCOS and lower blood sugar levels but studies have actually shown it to reduce your risk of cancer and help you lose weight unfortunately metformin can cause side effects in some patients like nausea, wind and diarrhoea",43.5,22.56,66.06,sad
but the chances of developing these can be reduced by taking it after food and also when you first started on them building up your dose slowly to the prescribed dose now you've just been started on immediate release metformin and hopefully your prescriber will explain to you how to slowly build up your dose to the prescribed dose and this is to help reduce the chances of you developing side effects,66.84,21.196,88.036,sad
and in the world of pharmacy this building up we call it dose of titrating now in case they haven't or you've just forgotten here's a general guide on how to build up your dose of immediate-release metformin to the prescribed dose now please remember this is a general guide and your dose may be different so I definitely advise everyone to speak their doctor or speak to your pharmacist about this,88.48,19.634999999999998,108.11500000000001,NA
"so in this example let's say the final dose of immediate release metformin for type 2 diabetes was three times a day with main meals so we have breakfast, lunch and dinner which you'll be taking it with but we don't want to jump straight into three times a day as you're much more likely to have side effects which mentioned earlier so build up your dose
weekly to the final prescribed dose so for my example to begin with take 500mg of immediate-release metformin daily",108.74,24.8,133.54,NA
"with your biggest meal which is dinner for most people after a week or two if you're getting on fine with no significant side effects increase to 500mg twice a day with main meals so for most people that will be breakfast and dinner and after another week or two if you're getting on fine with no significant side effects increase to 500mg three times a day with main meals so breakfast,lunch and dinner",133.98,21.240000000000002,155.22,sad
"please remember this is a general guide and your dose may be different so always speak to your pharmacist or a doctor about this before you do it so what we're basically doing is building up the dose of immediate release metformin by 500mg every one to two weeks until we reach
the final dose prescribed by your doctor and if after a dose increase you start getting side effects which don't go after a week or two",155.78,21.68,177.46,sad
then reduce the dose back down to what you were getting on well with then speak to your doctor definitely don't stop taking your medicines until you speak to your doctor now let's say after slowly building up your dose of immediate release metformin you're still having side effects and it's getting too much well now it's time to speak to your doctor about it they might change your medicine completely or they might change the type of metformin,177.76,20.42,198.18,sad
and give you the slow-release tablet which usually has less side effects but remember this that the dose of the slow release tablet is different to the immediate release tablet so always double check it with your pharmacist or doctor and that's it you now know how to start taking immediate release metformin properly if you have any tips which work for you which others might find helpful then please leave a comment below,198.66,19.5,218.16,NA
