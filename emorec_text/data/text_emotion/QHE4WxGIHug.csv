[Music] yeah so so treatment almost always starts with pituitary surgery um and i think that's that's a surgery,1.0,19.558999999999997,20.558999999999997,angry
called transphenoidal surgery uh where uh the surgeon actually goes up either through through the nose or through the roof of the mouth to the pituitary gland so there's no,10.24,19.121,29.360999999999997,neutral

be seen by a surgeon that's experienced with that particular type of surgery um really like like most surgeries you want to go to someone that that does it frequently and there are,32.559,20.081000000000003,52.64,neutral
a number of surgeons in the u.s and around the world that have a lot of experience that are terrific surgeons that are generally pretty well known um so,42.719,15.04,57.759,neutral
surgery tends to be the is the first line treatment um and for patients that are not cured there are uh there are a variety of medical therapies which i'll come,50.079,22.161,72.24000000000001,neutral
back to in a second as well as radiation therapy how to treat the tumors so so the medical therapies for uh for acromegaly,61.28,22.48,83.76,neutral
the the bulk of the therapy are what's called somatostatin analogs and somatostatin is an is a hormone that normally acts to suppress growth hormone and there are a number of,72.4,21.359,93.75900000000001,neutral
synthetic versions of of semanostatin that are used typically they're given as a monthly injection uh a long-lasting injection and there are,82.799,17.521,100.32000000000001,neutral
there are two major ones now there's uh uh octreotide uh and lanreantide and they work similarly,92.24,17.839,110.079,NA
no there have been guidelines published by the endocrine society in the united states and the european society for endocrinology in europe uh which which are,100.72,18.799,119.519,NA
basically very similar guidelines uh which is um surgery first uh followed by cementostatin analogue so either the octreotide or the or the landriatide,109.439,27.841,137.28,NA
sometimes with or um with with the burglary and the oral agent um sometimes people try cabergulene first but but,123.36,17.520999999999997,140.881,NA
that as i said that tends to be less effective so typically the spen cementostatin analogs are used first um and then um,132.72,24.0,156.72,NA
if the patient either can't tolerate it or the drugs are not effective uh then uh sometimes radiation is considered as in my view third line therapy for most,144.72,21.400000000000002,166.12,NA
