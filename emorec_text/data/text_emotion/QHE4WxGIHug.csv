[Music],1.0,2.6,3.6,sad
yeah so so treatment,2.24,3.76,6.0,sad
almost always starts with pituitary,3.6,3.84,7.4399999999999995,sad
surgery,6.0,4.24,10.24,sad
um and i think that's that's a surgery,7.44,5.119,12.559000000000001,sad
called transphenoidal surgery,10.24,5.2,15.440000000000001,sad
uh where uh the surgeon actually goes up,12.559,4.241,16.799999999999997,sad
either through through the nose or,15.44,3.04,18.48,sad
through the roof of the mouth,16.8,3.6,20.400000000000002,sad
to the pituitary gland so there's no,18.48,3.04,21.52,sad
external scar,20.4,3.84,24.24,sad
that comes from that type of surgery i,21.52,3.919,25.439,sad
think,24.24,4.4,28.64,sad
it's incredibly important for for,25.439,7.12,32.559,sad
anyone who's having pituitary surgery to,28.64,5.439,34.079,sad
be seen by a surgeon that's experienced,32.559,3.68,36.239,sad
with that particular type of surgery,34.079,3.841,37.92,sad
um really like like most surgeries you,36.239,3.281,39.519999999999996,sad
want to go to someone that that,37.92,4.799,42.719,sad
does it frequently and there are,39.52,4.48,44.0,sad
a number of surgeons in the u.s and,42.719,2.801,45.52,sad
around the world that have a lot of,44.0,2.8,46.8,neutral
experience that are terrific surgeons,45.52,1.84,47.36000000000001,sad
that are,46.8,3.279,50.07899999999999,sad
generally pretty well known um so,47.36,4.32,51.68,sad
surgery tends to be the is the first,50.079,3.281,53.36,sad
line treatment,51.68,5.199,56.879,sad
um and for patients that are not,53.36,6.24,59.6,sad
cured there are uh there are a variety,56.879,4.401,61.28,sad
of medical therapies which i'll come,59.6,3.04,62.64,sad
back to in a second,61.28,3.599,64.879,sad
as well as radiation therapy how to,62.64,3.839,66.479,sad
treat the tumors,64.879,5.961,70.84,sad
so so the medical therapies for uh for,66.479,5.921,72.4,sad
acromegaly,70.84,3.16,74.0,sad
the the bulk of the therapy are what's,72.4,3.759,76.159,sad
called somatostatin analogs,74.0,5.119,79.119,sad
and somatostatin is an is a hormone that,76.159,4.401,80.56,sad
normally acts to suppress,79.119,3.68,82.799,sad
growth hormone and there are a number of,80.56,4.4,84.96000000000001,sad
synthetic versions of of semanostatin,82.799,3.521,86.32000000000001,sad
that are used,84.96,2.96,87.91999999999999,sad
typically they're given as a monthly,86.32,3.36,89.67999999999999,sad
injection uh,87.92,4.32,92.24000000000001,sad
a long-lasting injection and there are,89.68,3.36,93.04,sad
there are,92.24,3.28,95.52,fear
two major ones now there's uh uh,93.04,3.92,96.96000000000001,fear
octreotide,95.52,3.44,98.96,happy
uh and lanreantide and they work,96.96,3.76,100.72,sad
similarly,98.96,3.439,102.399,sad
no there have been guidelines published,100.72,3.28,104.0,sad
by the endocrine society in the united,102.399,2.801,105.2,sad
states and the european,104.0,3.759,107.759,happy
society for endocrinology in europe uh,105.2,4.239,109.43900000000001,fear
which which are,107.759,4.72,112.479,sad
basically very similar guidelines uh,109.439,6.72,116.15899999999999,sad
which is um surgery first,112.479,5.68,118.15899999999999,NA
uh followed by cementostatin analogue so,116.159,4.481,120.64,NA
either the octreotide or the or the,118.159,5.201,123.36,sad
landriatide,120.64,5.759,126.399,sad
sometimes with or um,123.36,4.64,128.0,sad
with with the burglary and the oral,126.399,3.121,129.52,sad
agent um,128.0,3.68,131.68,sad
sometimes people try cabergulene first,129.52,3.2,132.72,NA
but but,131.68,2.88,134.56,NA
that as i said that tends to be less,132.72,3.2,135.92,NA
effective,134.56,3.92,138.48,NA
so typically the spen cementostatin,135.92,4.8,140.72,NA
analogs are used first,138.48,6.24,144.72,NA
um and then um,140.72,5.84,146.56,NA
if the patient either can't tolerate it,144.72,4.0,148.72,NA
or the drugs are not effective,146.56,4.8,151.36,NA
uh then uh sometimes radiation is,148.72,3.68,152.4,NA
considered as,151.36,3.48,154.84,NA
in my view third line therapy for most,152.4,5.44,157.84,NA
people,154.84,3.0,157.84,NA
