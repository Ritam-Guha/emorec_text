the oral glucose-tolerance test it's a,0.05,9.52,9.57,happy
test where you drink a lot of sugar,5.7,6.54,12.24,fear
water to figure out how your body reacts,9.57,5.939,15.509,fear
to too much sugar basically I am going,12.24,4.77,17.009999999999998,fear
to do this but I've been dreading this,15.509,4.11,19.619,
I've been postponing this the idea is,17.01,4.56,21.57,
eight ounces of water which is quarter,19.619,5.431,25.05,
of leader and 75 grams of sugar now I,21.57,6.209,27.779,
took honey and here's the water with the,25.05,7.259,32.309,
honey I need to it's quite a lot and the,27.779,8.94,36.719,
idea is to drink this in a short period,32.309,7.441,39.75,
of time take a bleep plug on the glucose,36.719,4.801,41.52,happy
and two hours later take your lip,39.75,17.879,57.629000000000005,
glucose again see what happens and we're,41.52,18.23,59.75,
done,57.629,2.121,59.75,fear

going to test again Cheers,80.85,5.6,86.44999999999999,
actually it is pretty good good stuff,91.909,10.981,102.89,
it's not scientific because it's honey,104.24,7.36,111.6,
instead of sugar honey contains my 9%,107.43,6.439,113.869,
sugar,111.6,2.269,113.869,happy

feeling too bad bit nauseous but little,131.36,5.459,136.81900000000002,
bit whoa,134.78,7.53,142.31,
and we have a rise 8.7 a quick rice this,136.819,7.621,144.44,
is one hour and next test it's going to,142.31,5.399,147.709,
be two hours see if I drop it down or it,144.44,6.54,150.98,
rises even further then past one so it's,147.709,5.581,153.29,angry
two hours and we're going to take,150.98,8.789,159.76899999999998,fear
another measurement is it ah look it's,153.29,9.36,162.64999999999998,fear
gonna peak and it's down but it's not,159.769,6.621,166.39000000000001,

ten past two three hours after my sugar,166.39,12.34,178.73,
shot let's see what happened and we have,171.56,10.32,181.88,
dropped down five point two it's about,178.73,8.49,187.22,
the same level as it was before and it's,181.88,9.54,191.42,
good that means no pre-diabetics no,187.22,6.0,193.22,

you're supposed to take tests the test,193.22,4.29,197.51,fear
is supposed to go with sugar not honey,195.2,5.18,200.38,fear
and the measurements needs to be,197.51,6.66,204.17,
intravenous and not with a little needle,200.38,5.65,206.03,
for the pinprick or anything like that,204.17,4.11,208.28,
but this is not medical at all this was,206.03,5.789,211.819,
just going to see what happens and now I,208.28,5.959,214.239,
did,211.819,2.42,214.23899999999998,happy
