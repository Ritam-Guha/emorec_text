you can get really high quality coffee for like a dollar 20 using any of the vending machines and then you just tap a Suika card or IC card but I was able to make one in Apple wallet it's super easy,0.12,25.198,25.318,angry
God I love coming to Japan anyway I'm here at C Tech 2019 hopefully it will be one of the shows that I go to every year in the rotation of tech shows and what I noticed is that a lot of the tech as,11.219,23.611,34.83,angry
being showcased at this more business-to-business show happens to be health oriented which makes a lot of sense in general but one of the main finds that was here in the hall seven or,24.689,21.511,46.2,angry
eight of C Tech 2019 was a product that I was inspired to bring up and use as a resurrection of type two foodie hey it's Josh Vergara what's going on everybody let's take a,34.17,21.749,55.919,angry
look at this little piece of tech that might be able to monitor your blood glucose levels without having to draw actual blood all right so this particular product is being developed by,46.05,20.91,66.96,angry
Kyocera but this little device that uses gyro sensors presses up against an artery that's right here below the area of the thumb underneath the palm in order to measure blood flow and a few,56.219,23.79,80.009,NA
different metrics about it now it's a little bit tough for me to talk about the science behind this and I was really curious about it but unfortunately with some of the language barriers and even,68.22,16.471,84.691,NA
with an interpreter we weren't really able to get some hard facts about the science behind this lifestyle product now it's really important for me to say lifestyle product because Kyocera does,76.92,18.329,95.249,NA
not want this to be considered a full medical device and I think one of the main reasons why is because the accuracy of this device might still be a little bit in question but it could give you a,85.979,17.009999999999998,102.989,NA
little bit of a snapshot into your overall health when you measure your levels before a meal ends at a certain time after the meals any type 2 diabetics out there like myself know,94.439,19.5,113.939,NA
that these are very important metrics how your blood sugar reacts to the food you eat all right so here's what one of those tests actually looks like I have the gentleman measure what they call,104.25,21.211,125.461,angry
just my carbohydrate level and they pressed this gyro sensor right up to the large artery under my hand somewhere around there at least and I was already feeling a little bit out,114.09,20.429,134.519,angry
about it because I had tested my blood sugar earlier in the morning to see what my fasted levels were and I didn't eat all the way up and so this particular moment so let me just cut to the part,124.89,18.781000000000002,143.671,angry
where I ran right back to the room to test my blood again to test that accuracy all right so I just got back from getting that rating done I just wanted to cut to this real quick because,134.58,16.469,151.049,angry
I got really curious I'm still looking up a couple of journal sites and some articles that state that this kind of measurement actually gives you an accurate reading of your blood glucose,142.379,18.630000000000003,161.009,NA
now generally for people like me who are type-2 diabetic we have to use devices like this so you probably are familiar with little blood glucose meters like this where you put a strip in you put,151.44,19.951,171.391,NA
some blood in and then it gives you what should be a fairly accurate reading so I'm gonna do that right now and the reading was around 1:40 based upon the device that we're talking about in this,161.91,17.279,179.189,angry
video so let's see what happens here alright so there you go 110 so I know that my blood sugar is at a pretty good level 110 is pretty good for a type-2 diabetic like myself but I'm really,170.7,19.051000000000002,189.75099999999998,angry
curious and I guess I'll talk about it a little bit later after I cut away from this quick segment that I did just to talk about how something like a gyro sensor or a gyroscope would actually,180.06,18.9,198.96,angry
show you what the trends in your blood glucose might be because that's what this product is supposed to do you take a measurement before your meal and then you take a measurement sometime after,188.91,16.439,205.349,NA
the meal and it gives you some of the trends and gives you a look at what your carbohydrate intake might do to you so I can't really speak to the science buying all of this but I don't think Kyocera,197.849,18.061,215.91,NA
wants to either again this is a lifestyle device not a medical device so it's just a way for you to know generally how you are how you're feeling what you should probably look out for,206.88,18.778999999999996,225.659,NA
and then you go to the medical devices to figure out the actual data after that but for anybody out there that wants to have a good snapshot of their health and they might be diabetic this is a great,216.18,18.871000000000002,235.05100000000002,angry
way of doing so without having to worry about the lancets and drawing blood and all of that stuff so it might actually be more accessible to people who are a bit skittish about that and honestly I'm,225.75,17.789,243.539,angry
still curious about the science behind checking a blood flow or blood pulse as a way of measuring blood glucose levels and if anybody out there knows the science behind it please let me know,234.419,18.991,253.41000000000003,angry
link it in the description below this is a study that I found trying to connect heart rate variability which is a new type of metric that we're starting to use more in the US as a way of measuring,243.78,20.6,264.38,angry
blood glucose levels over time and as long as the variance is rather high meaning that it's not the exact same beat each time especially if your heart rate is high,254.11,14.069,268.17900000000003,happy
that means that your body is less stressed and you might be a healthier person overall so kind of in a nutshell that story found that with higher heart rate variance or HRV those people,261.459,20.521,281.98,angry
generally had less hyperinsulinemia and also lower blood glucose you know you got to respect the hustle she's trying to sell the food to all the people who are trying to go to the conference right,271.09,20.22,291.30999999999995,disgust
now so it's only Gehry which I would love to eat but this is type-2 foodie we're talking about anyway the takeaway is pretty obvious I want to see more devices like this in the diabetes world,280.84,24.12,304.96,NA
because some people might be a little bit squeamish about actually drawing blood all the time and it's something that we diabetics have to live with all the time something that's a bit easier,293.71,14.49,308.2,NA
something you can use at any time and something that's not invasive that would be huge for monitoring one's glucose levels and for managing diabetes in any case I'm gonna go ahead and call it on,300.91,21.75,322.66,NA
this one thank you so much for watching look forward to more stuff that I'm doing here in Japan I'm trying to do a lot of stuff here because I love being in Japan I have a lot of tech that I,312.16,17.16,329.32000000000005,NA
want to show off fewer views and obviously type-2 foodie is every Friday so stay tuned to my channel for even more things about health type 2 diabetes stuff like that I just want to talk,319.81,20.008999999999997,339.819,NA
about every Friday on the segment called type 2 foodie I'm gonna walk away from the onigiri and make sure I don't get tempted and you know what I'm just gonna go ahead and remind you to to enjoy your,330.28,20.96,351.23999999999995,NA
tea everybody,340.479,2.511,342.99,NA
