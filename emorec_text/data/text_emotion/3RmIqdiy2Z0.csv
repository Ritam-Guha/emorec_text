you can get really high quality coffee,0.12,5.19,5.3100000000000005,NA
for like a dollar 20 using any of the,1.74,5.22,6.96,NA
vending machines and then you just tap a,5.31,4.32,9.629999999999999,NA
Suika card or IC card but I was able to,6.96,4.259,11.219000000000001,NA
make one in Apple wallet it's super easy,9.63,6.209,15.839,NA
God I love coming to Japan anyway I'm,11.219,6.871,18.09,NA
here at C Tech 2019 hopefully it will be,15.839,4.081,19.92,NA
one of the shows that I go to every year,18.09,4.859,22.948999999999998,NA
in the rotation of tech shows and what I,19.92,4.769,24.689,NA
noticed is that a lot of the tech as,22.949,3.031,25.98,NA
being showcased at this more,24.689,3.901,28.59,NA
business-to-business show happens to be,25.98,4.26,30.240000000000002,sad
health oriented which makes a lot of,28.59,3.54,32.13,sad
sense in general but one of the main,30.24,3.93,34.17,sad
finds that was here in the hall seven or,32.13,5.88,38.010000000000005,NA
eight of C Tech 2019 was a product that,34.17,7.409,41.579,NA
I was inspired to bring up and use as a,38.01,6.03,44.04,NA
resurrection of type two foodie hey it's,41.579,3.121,44.7,NA
Josh Vergara,44.04,2.01,46.05,NA
what's going on everybody let's take a,44.7,3.179,47.879000000000005,NA
look at this little piece of tech that,46.05,4.14,50.19,NA
might be able to monitor your blood,47.879,4.561,52.44,NA
glucose levels without having to draw,50.19,4.439,54.629,NA
actual blood all right so this,52.44,3.779,56.218999999999994,NA
particular product is being developed by,54.629,3.991,58.62,NA
Kyocera but this little device that uses,56.219,4.59,60.809,NA
gyro sensors presses up against an,58.62,4.29,62.91,NA
artery that's right here below the area,60.809,4.5,65.309,NA
of the thumb underneath the palm in,62.91,5.31,68.22,NA
order to measure blood flow and a few,65.309,5.1,70.40899999999999,NA
different metrics about it now it's a,68.22,3.09,71.31,NA
little bit tough for me to talk about,70.409,2.82,73.229,NA
the science behind this and I was really,71.31,3.69,75.0,NA
curious about it but unfortunately with,73.229,3.691,76.92,NA
some of the language barriers and even,75.0,3.18,78.18,NA
with an interpreter we weren't really,76.92,3.36,80.28,NA
able to get some hard facts about the,78.18,4.53,82.71000000000001,NA
science behind this lifestyle product,80.28,3.93,84.21000000000001,NA
now it's really important for me to say,82.71,3.269,85.979,NA
lifestyle product because Kyocera does,84.21,3.24,87.44999999999999,NA
not want this to be considered a full,85.979,3.21,89.189,NA
medical device and I think one of the,87.45,3.54,90.99000000000001,NA
main reasons why is because the accuracy,89.189,3.36,92.54899999999999,NA
of this device might still be a little,90.99,3.449,94.439,NA
bit in question but it could give you a,92.549,3.451,96.0,NA
little bit of a snapshot into your,94.439,3.72,98.15899999999999,NA
overall health when you measure your,96.0,4.829,100.829,NA
levels before a meal ends at a certain,98.159,4.771,102.93,NA
time after the meals any type 2,100.829,3.421,104.25,NA
diabetics out there like myself know,102.93,2.759,105.68900000000001,NA
that these are very important metrics,104.25,3.96,108.21,NA
how your blood sugar reacts to the food,105.689,4.621,110.30999999999999,NA
you eat all right so here's what one of,108.21,3.72,111.92999999999999,NA
those tests actually looks like I have,110.31,3.78,114.09,NA
the gentleman measure what they call,111.93,5.13,117.06,NA
just my carbohydrate level and they,114.09,5.94,120.03,NA
pressed this gyro sensor right up to the,117.06,4.379,121.43900000000001,NA
large artery under my hand,120.03,3.42,123.45,NA
somewhere around there at least and I,121.439,3.451,124.88999999999999,NA
was already feeling a little bit out,123.45,3.239,126.68900000000001,NA
about it because I had tested my blood,124.89,3.479,128.369,NA
sugar earlier in the morning to see what,126.689,4.501,131.19,NA
my fasted levels were and I didn't eat,128.369,4.291,132.66,NA
all the way up and so this particular,131.19,3.39,134.57999999999998,NA
moment so let me just cut to the part,132.66,3.12,135.78,NA
where I ran right back to the room to,134.58,2.909,137.489,sad
test my blood again to test that,135.78,3.81,139.59,sad
accuracy all right so I just got back,137.489,3.72,141.209,sad
from getting that rating done I just,139.59,2.789,142.379,NA
wanted to cut to this real quick because,141.209,3.241,144.45000000000002,NA
I got really curious I'm still looking,142.379,4.321,146.7,NA
up a couple of journal sites and some,144.45,3.99,148.44,sad
articles that state that this kind of,146.7,3.149,149.849,fear
measurement actually gives you an,148.44,3.0,151.44,NA
accurate reading of your blood glucose,149.849,4.17,154.01899999999998,NA
now generally for people like me who are,151.44,5.31,156.75,NA
type-2 diabetic we have to use devices,154.019,4.771,158.79,sad
like this so you probably are familiar,156.75,3.66,160.41,NA
with little blood glucose meters like,158.79,3.12,161.91,NA
this where you put a strip in you put,160.41,3.09,163.5,NA
some blood in and then it gives you what,161.91,3.329,165.239,NA
should be a fairly accurate reading so,163.5,3.54,167.04,NA
I'm gonna do that right now and the,165.239,4.351,169.59,sad
reading was around 1:40 based upon the,167.04,3.66,170.7,sad
device that we're talking about in this,169.59,2.399,171.989,sad
video so let's see what happens here,170.7,3.929,174.629,sad
alright so there you go 110 so I know,171.989,4.14,176.129,NA
that my blood sugar is at a pretty good,174.629,2.881,177.51,NA
level 110 is pretty good for a type-2,176.129,3.931,180.06,NA
diabetic like myself but I'm really,177.51,4.17,181.67999999999998,NA
curious and I guess I'll talk about it a,180.06,2.819,182.879,NA
little bit later after I cut away from,181.68,3.57,185.25,NA
this quick segment that I did just to,182.879,4.17,187.04899999999998,NA
talk about how something like a gyro,185.25,3.66,188.91,NA
sensor or a gyroscope would actually,187.049,4.681,191.73000000000002,sad
show you what the trends in your blood,188.91,4.38,193.29,sad
glucose might be because that's what,191.73,3.06,194.79,sad
this product is supposed to do you take,193.29,3.15,196.44,NA
a measurement before your meal and then,194.79,3.059,197.849,NA
you take a measurement sometime after,196.44,2.79,199.23,NA
the meal and it gives you some of the,197.849,2.851,200.7,NA
trends and gives you a look at what your,199.23,4.589,203.819,NA
carbohydrate intake might do to you so I,200.7,4.649,205.349,NA
can't really speak to the science buying,203.819,3.061,206.88,NA
all of this but I don't think Kyocera,205.349,2.911,208.26,sad
wants to either again this is a,206.88,4.05,210.93,sad
lifestyle device not a medical device so,208.26,3.839,212.099,NA
it's just a way for you to know,210.93,3.54,214.47,NA
generally how you are how you're feeling,212.099,4.081,216.17999999999998,NA
what you should probably look out for,214.47,3.269,217.739,NA
and then you go to the medical devices,216.18,3.779,219.959,NA
to figure out the actual data after that,217.739,3.81,221.549,NA
but for anybody out there that wants to,219.959,3.78,223.739,sad
have a good snapshot of their health and,221.549,4.201,225.75,sad
they might be diabetic this is a great,223.739,3.301,227.04,sad
way of doing so without having to worry,225.75,3.209,228.959,sad
about the lancets and drawing blood and,227.04,3.18,230.22,sad
all of that stuff so it might actually,228.959,2.761,231.72,NA
be more accessible to people who are a,230.22,4.199,234.419,NA
bit skittish about that and honestly I'm,231.72,4.44,236.16,NA
still curious about the science behind,234.419,4.861,239.28,sad
checking a blood flow or blood pulse as,236.16,5.04,241.2,sad
a way of measuring blood glucose levels,239.28,3.239,242.519,sad
and if anybody out there knows the,241.2,2.58,243.78,neutral
science behind it please let me know,242.519,3.271,245.79,neutral
link it in the description below this is,243.78,3.929,247.709,neutral
a study that I found trying to connect,245.79,3.9,249.69,sad
heart rate variability which is a new,247.709,3.3,251.00900000000001,sad
type of metric that we're starting to,249.69,4.42,254.10999999999999,sad
use more in the US as a way of measuring,251.009,5.051,256.06,neutral
blood glucose levels over time and as,254.11,3.39,257.5,neutral
long as the variance is rather high,256.06,2.73,258.79,sad
meaning that it's not the exact same,257.5,3.18,260.68,sad
beat each time especially if your heart,258.79,2.669,261.459,sad
rate is high,260.68,2.1,262.78000000000003,sad
that means that your body is less,261.459,3.121,264.58,neutral
stressed and you might be a healthier,262.78,3.66,266.44,neutral
person overall so kind of in a nutshell,264.58,4.38,268.96,sad
that story found that with higher heart,266.44,4.65,271.09,sad
rate variance or HRV those people,268.96,4.71,273.66999999999996,sad
generally had less hyperinsulinemia and,271.09,5.25,276.34,disgust
also lower blood glucose you know you,273.67,3.93,277.6,NA
got to respect the hustle she's trying,276.34,3.21,279.54999999999995,NA
to sell the food to all the people who,277.6,3.24,280.84000000000003,NA
are trying to go to the conference right,279.55,4.59,284.14,NA
now so it's only Gehry which I would,280.84,5.01,285.84999999999997,NA
love to eat but this is type-2 foodie,284.14,6.18,290.32,NA
we're talking about anyway the takeaway,285.85,5.73,291.58000000000004,NA
is pretty obvious I want to see more,290.32,3.39,293.71,NA
devices like this in the diabetes world,291.58,3.81,295.39,NA
because some people might be a little,293.71,3.0,296.71,NA
bit squeamish about actually drawing,295.39,2.37,297.76,NA
blood all the time and it's something,296.71,2.55,299.26,NA
that we diabetics have to live with all,297.76,3.15,300.90999999999997,NA
the time something that's a bit easier,299.26,3.42,302.68,NA
something you can use at any time and,300.91,3.75,304.66,NA
something that's not invasive that would,302.68,4.71,307.39,NA
be huge for monitoring one's glucose,304.66,6.48,311.14000000000004,NA
levels and for managing diabetes in any,307.39,4.77,312.15999999999997,NA
case I'm gonna go ahead and call it on,311.14,2.04,313.18,NA
this one thank you so much for watching,312.16,2.58,314.74,NA
look forward to more stuff that I'm,313.18,2.79,315.97,NA
doing here in Japan I'm trying to do a,314.74,3.45,318.19,NA
lot of stuff here because I love being,315.97,3.84,319.81,NA
in Japan I have a lot of tech that I,318.19,4.5,322.69,NA
want to show off fewer views and,319.81,4.53,324.34,NA
obviously type-2 foodie is every Friday,322.69,3.33,326.02,NA
so stay tuned to my channel for even,324.34,4.5,328.84,NA
more things about health type 2 diabetes,326.02,4.26,330.28,NA
stuff like that I just want to talk,328.84,3.389,332.229,NA
about every Friday on the segment called,330.28,3.6,333.88,NA
type 2 foodie I'm gonna walk away from,332.229,3.121,335.34999999999997,NA
the onigiri and make sure I don't get,333.88,3.27,337.15,NA
tempted and you know what I'm just gonna,335.35,5.129,340.47900000000004,NA
go ahead and remind you to to enjoy your,337.15,5.84,342.98999999999995,NA
tea everybody,340.479,2.511,342.99,NA
