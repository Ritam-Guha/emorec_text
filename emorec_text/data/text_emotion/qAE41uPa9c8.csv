hello my name is Karen Davies and I work,4.94,6.819,11.759,surprise
for diabetes nurse specialist I also,8.46,5.099,13.559000000000001,fear
deliver training for the NHS health,11.759,4.201,15.96,fear
check program which is a cardiovascular,13.559,5.88,19.439,fear
disease prevention service in this short,15.96,5.489,21.449,fear
video I'd like to give you some,19.439,5.67,25.109,fear
information on the hba1c test and how it,21.449,12.691,34.14,fear
can be used in health plans H P stands,25.109,12.36,37.469,fear
for hemoglobin hemoglobin is a protein,34.14,7.23,41.370000000000005,fear
molecule on the red blood cell we know,37.469,6.0,43.469,fear
that the lifespan of the red blood cell,41.37,6.66,48.03,fear
is approximately 120 days we also know,43.469,7.951,51.42,fear
that glucose or sugar attaches itself to,48.03,6.509,54.539,fear
the red blood cell so the higher the,51.42,5.909,57.329,
blood glucose level the more glucose,54.539,4.68,59.219,
that attaches itself to the red blood,57.329,5.761,63.09,fear
cell the hemoglobin alpha 1 C therefore,59.219,6.51,65.729,fear
as a test that averages out the blood,63.09,5.459,68.549,fear
sugar level over the last two to three,65.729,5.18,70.90899999999999,fear
months,68.549,2.36,70.909,fear
along with the fasting plasma glucose,73.92,6.22,80.14,fear
the hba1c can be used as a diagnostic,76.719,8.07,84.78899999999999,fear
tool of diabetes it's also used to,80.14,7.589,87.729,fear
measure ongoing control with somebody,84.789,6.421,91.21000000000001,fear
who has diabetes one advantage against,87.729,6.0,93.729,fear
the fasting plasma glucose is that the,91.21,4.979,96.189,fear
person doesn't have to fast to have the,93.729,6.631,100.36,fear
test we also know from research trials,96.189,7.47,103.65899999999999,fear
there is an evidence base in terms of,100.36,6.39,106.75,fear
reducing the hba1c and to improve,103.659,11.811,115.47,
outcome some of you may be used to hba1c,106.75,11.789,118.539,
being expressed as a percentage result,115.47,8.56,124.03,fear
however since 2009 the UK are adopting,118.539,8.94,127.479,fear
the IFC SI International Federation of,124.03,6.299,130.329,fear

[Music],133.08,7.87,140.95000000000002,fear
the normal hba1c result is a reading,136.51,8.58,145.09,fear
below 41 millimoles per month a person,140.95,5.879,146.82899999999998,fear
would be classed as high risk of,145.09,4.77,149.86,fear
diabetes if their result was between 42,146.829,6.83,153.65900000000002,fear
and 47 millimoles per low,149.86,7.43,157.29000000000002,fear
this is classed as pre-diabetes or,153.659,8.381,162.04,fear
non-diabetic hyperglycemia a current,157.29,8.38,165.67,fear
nice guidance so adults with type 1 and,162.04,7.559,169.599,

a hba1c of 48 millimoles per mole,169.599,7.5,177.099,fear
however it's really important to,174.09,5.979,180.06900000000002,fear
individualize targets for the person in,177.099,5.191,182.29,fear

the hba1c if it's not in target range,193.26,6.89,200.14999999999998,fear
might be tested three to six monthly,197.099,5.821,202.92,fear

trials the DCCT and the UKPDS,212.33,7.8,220.13000000000002,fear

your hba1c by eleven millimoles per mole,220.13,6.51,226.64,
