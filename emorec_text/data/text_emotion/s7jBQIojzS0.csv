"FRANK: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. I'm really excited to
introduce Dr. James Shapiro. Dr. Shapiro's been working
on diabetes research for a long time, and
in particular he's",2.044,10.276,12.32,NA
"credited with
developing the Edmonton Protocol for human islet
cell transplantation, which was published in the New
England Journal of Medicine in the year 2000. He's currently
continuing this research",12.32,10.89,23.21,NA
"at the University of
Alberta in Edmonton, Canada. And he also holds the
Canadian Research Chair in transplantation and
regenerative medicine. Dr. Shapiro's received
quite a lot of awards, including a Hunterian
medal from the Royal",23.21,14.719999999999999,37.93,neutral
"College of Surgeons of England. And he's also
recently been inducted as a fellow of the
Royal Society of Canada. And with that, please help
me welcome Dr. Shapiro. DR. JAMES SHAPIRO: Frank,
thank you very much indeed.",37.93,11.478,49.408,NA
"It's very kind of you
to invite me to Google. I'm very impressed
with my tour so far. And I'm very excited
about the discussion that we're going to have
later on this afternoon. So it's a great privilege
to be here and be with you",53.55,10.769,64.319,NA
"and share our hopes and trials
and tribulations and progress in some of the treatments for
the condition of diabetes. So we're trying
to get to a point where we have
diabetes cured once and for all for the future.",64.319,15.450999999999999,79.77,NA
"But it's not easy to do
that in one fell swoop. So we've got several
strategies, and it's really a team and global effort
in diabetes research, to try and take a point
where we have insulin today and hopefully no injections,
no monitoring for the future.",79.77,14.530000000000001,94.3,NA
"And I'll try and take
you along that journey of cutting edge islet and stem
cell transplant treatments in the clinic for diabetes
as we move forward today. So diabetes. Most of you will know
what diabetes is,",94.3,12.12,106.42,NA
"but just the start
of the basics. Diabetes is a condition
where patients lose the ability to
adjust their blood sugar. And there are two main
types of diabetes-- there are several subtypes--
but two main types.",106.42,11.01,117.43,NA
"Type one, where the
pancreas basically has lost its ability
to make insulin. The cells in the pancreas
that make insulin are called islets of Langerhans. And inside those collections
of cells there are beta cells,",117.43,12.091,129.52100000000002,NA
"and those are the beta cells
are the ones that make insulin. So in someone who has
type I diabetes then the body has basically destroyed
those cells-- destroyed the beta cells inside the
pancreas inside the islets that make insulin.",129.521,12.369,141.89,NA
"So the patients have an
absolute deficiency of insulin. And the other type
of diabetes-- which is of course much more common
and increasing in number as well-- is type 2
diabetes, where patients become resistant to insulin.",141.89,12.399999999999999,154.29,NA
"And therefore when
they receive insulin, or the pancreas
is making insulin, the body's needs for
insulin are basically what the pancreas can
release is insufficient. So diabetes is a very
common condition.",154.29,14.720000000000002,169.01,NA
"There are about
381 million people with diabetes in
the world today, based on the world estimates
from the Diabetes Federation 2013. Type I diabetes represents about
10% of the world population.",169.01,12.879999999999999,181.89,NA
"By 2030, this population with
type I and type 2 diabetes will double. So it's going to be a huge, huge
health burden for the future. The national cost of diabetes
in this country and the US alone is greater than $245
billion estimated last year.",181.89,17.32,199.20999999999998,NA
"And that increased from
$174 billion in 2007. And clearly, with
the massive increase in numbers of patients
with diabetes, this is going to become
uncontrollable and super saturate the ability
of health care systems",199.21,13.04,212.25,NA
"to deliver appropriate care. So insulin has been around for
a long time, as some of you may know. Banting/Best-- and this
is Frederick Banting in the physiology laboratories
in London, Canada in 1920,",212.25,16.59,228.84,NA
"1921, 1922 when the
team was working on the discovery of insulin
Banting, Best, Collip, and Macleod. And insulin injection
therapy clearly has been life-saving for many,
many patients with type 1",228.84,12.565000000000001,241.405,NA
"and some patients
with type 2 diabetes. So injections of
insulin from the outside can substitute for the pancreas'
ability to make insulin. And we measure insulin
in the number of units. So most patients will take 20,
30, 40 units on insulin a day.",241.405,15.844999999999999,257.25,NA
"And they measure the number
of units of insulin-- it was a crude amount-- it was
the amount of insulin needed, one unit of instant to cause
hypoglycemia in a rabbit. That's how they
originally discovered it when Banting and Best
were working on this.",257.25,14.54,271.79,NA
"Diabetes is a dangerous
condition to have overall. Kidney failure is a
problem-- 25 times more risk than the
general population. Heart attacks-- two to
five times more risk than the general population.",271.79,11.52,283.31,NA
"Strokes-- two to
three times more risk. And life expectancy for
patients with diabetes is at least 10 years shorter
than the rest of the world without diabetes. Diabetes is the leading
cause of vision loss",283.31,13.37,296.68,NA
"in working age adults. It's the commonest cause of
end stage kidney failure, and of non-traumatic
lower limb amputations, because the blood
vessels basically become destroyed when the
body's glucose becomes awry.",296.68,14.29,310.97,NA
"There's been lots
of improvements in the treatment of diabetes
over the course of time. As I mentioned, before
the discovery of insulin in 1921, 1922, diabetes
was a fatal condition. When insulin was first
tried in patients,",310.97,12.11,323.08000000000004,NA
"it led to complications--
infection, sepsis. Then there's been
various improvements in different types of insulin--
short acting, long acting insulin-- in different
ways of delivering insulin over the course of time,
including insulin pumps,",323.08,14.970000000000002,338.05,NA
"including continuous blood
glucose monitoring systems. And the whole idea here is to
try to tighten up the sugar control so that patients
are at less risk of getting the end stage complications
of diabetes-- the micro and the macro
complications of diabetes.",338.05,13.8,351.85,NA
"And the reverse side
of that equation is we try to tighten
up the control as the patients get much
more of this condition, which is a iatrogenic condition--
in other words, caused by doctors-- which is
called hypoglycemia.",351.85,10.950000000000001,362.8,NA
"So when the blood sugar falls
below a certain threshold, then patients
become susceptible, because the brain absolutely
requires glucose to function. As soon as the blood glucose
drops below a certain level, then the brain can
no longer function.",362.8,14.25,377.05,NA
"So islet cell transplantation
has been around since the 1970s experimentally. And first trials in patients
happened in the 1980s. And it really took
off in 2000, and there have been several done.",377.05,14.56,391.61,NA
"I'm now going to
explain and tell you the story about
transportation shortly. But really our indications
for islet transplantation have been to try to reduce
this risk of hypoglycemia, reducing the risk
of lows in patients",391.61,12.139999999999999,403.75,NA
"that are needing insulin. So why do we try to run
the blood sugar low? This is really based on
some very large trials in patients with diabetes. We know from these
curves for example,",403.75,10.37,414.12,NA
"as we try to tighten up
the blood sugar control, we can definitely reduce
the risk of complications such as this one on the right,
called retinopathy, which is where the blood vessels in
the back of the eye accelerate, and grow, and cause
the blindness.",414.12,12.08,426.2,NA
"But, as we tighten
up the control, then patients are more and
more at risk of getting lows. And we measure this by
the glycated hemoglobin, which is a marker in the
bloodstream that really tells you how good or
bad the blood sugar",426.2,11.17,437.37,NA
"control is over several months. So here's a patient that's
wearing a state-of-the-art continuous glucose monitor. And you can see across
day one and day two, this patient has quite
wide fluctuations",437.37,12.680000000000001,450.05,NA
"in blood sugar control. And at 8:00 in the
morning on the second day, you can see the
blood glucose drops, the patient is on their
own, not monitored. And unfortunately,
that patient's",450.05,10.700000000000001,460.75,NA
"found dead in bed
at 9:00 an hour later, from a fatal
hypoglycemic event. And fortunately, this
is relatively rare, but it does happen. And it happens in young
adults with type 1 diabetes",460.75,10.8,471.55,NA
"that have poor control. Now this is what we can achieve
today with an islet cell transplant in the
lower panel here. You can see very
wide fluctuations in blood sugar over
the course of time,",471.55,11.96,483.51,NA
"up until that red arrow
when the patient receives an islet transplant. This is a transplant that
actually is done in Miami. Dr. Camillo Ricordi shared
this slide and data with me. But it's very typical of
what we can achieve routinely",483.51,12.84,496.34999999999997,NA
"with an islet cell transplant. And here you can see, after
the islet transplant, when the patient discontinues
insulin, the blood sugar control becomes very tight,
is in the normal range or near normal range.",496.35,10.844000000000001,507.194,NA
"The price of this however,
is that the patient needs a procedure-- a small
procedure to receive cells-- and has to have
immunosuppressive drugs in order for the body not
to reject these cells. They're transplanted
cells from organ donors,",507.194,12.096,519.29,NA
"and they are
therefore potentially foreign to the body. And also the process
that caused diabetes in the first place, which
is an autoimmune process, meaning the body attacks itself.",519.29,10.32,529.61,NA
"This will happen
again after an islet transparent to the new cells,
unless the anti-rejection drugs are given. So there's been real progress
in islet cell transplantation. I'll explain that to you.",529.61,10.55,540.16,NA
"But I think we're somewhere
along this hype cycle right now, perhaps
somewhere along the slope of enlightenment. We haven't got to
Nirvana yet, but we're trying to get there along
the plateau of productivity.",540.16,10.440000000000001,550.6,NA
"And still I think
if you can read and you can Google lots
of negative reviews on islet transplantation,
because I think the knowledge
in this area probably hasn't reached all
of the community.",550.6,11.803999999999998,562.404,NA
"But I'm sharing with you
today some of the progress. But there's been progress
throughout diabetes. And here for example,
is a trial that was just completed in
September last year, looking at a special instant pump that
switches off when the blood",562.404,11.716,574.12,NA
"sugar reaches a certain low
threshold, low glucose suspend. And when this is
applied to patients, then the risk of patients
getting hypoglycemia is certainly a lot less
than it would be otherwise. So there's been
lots of progress.",574.12,13.06,587.18,NA
"And I'm also very
excited this afternoon to meet with your Google
contact lens team. Because I think the areas of
monitoring for blood sugar control, and our
ability to monitor the function of our cell
transplant therapies",587.18,10.790000000000001,597.9699999999999,NA
"over time with this
kind of technology will be enormously informative
and allow us to tighten up our control, minimize
the stress on the cells, and allow us all to learn a
lot about controlling diabetes. So who do we offer an
islet transplant to today?",597.97,14.86,612.83,NA
"We have two real
major categories-- those with patients who have
an islet transplant alone. In other words, they haven't
had a previous transplant. They have to have
type 1 diabetes for more than five years.",612.83,11.374000000000002,624.2040000000001,NA
"They have to fail on all the
standard therapies, including insulin pumps if available. And we have various
scoring systems, which I won't dwell on,
but they're basically to demonstrate that the
patient has severe lows,",624.204,12.186,636.39,NA
"despite their ability to control
the glucose as best they can. And about 5% to 10% of
the population with type 1 diabetes-- at least
in Canada-- would fulfill these very
strict criteria to justify adding
immunosuppression and receiving",636.39,13.870000000000001,650.26,NA
"a cell infusion. The other side of
the equation are patients who have already
had a successful transplant, like a heart, a lung, or in
this case, a kidney transplant. So they're already on
the anti-rejection drugs,",650.26,10.379999999999999,660.64,NA
"so they don't have to
face any additional risk except from the minor risk
of the procedure required to put the cells in. And islet after kidney
transplant, or second category, is becoming a very
successful category too.",660.64,12.389999999999999,673.03,NA
"So we began with the Edmonton
protocol in the year 2000. It didn't just
begin from nowhere. It began from 30
years of research in small and large
animal models. And a terrific collaboration
with several international",673.03,12.71,685.74,NA
"centers across the world. And I think that's one of the
privileges involved in science and in diabetes
research, is that we have a very, very close knit
community of scientists working together, willing to share
information and ideas",685.74,13.39,699.13,NA
"to allow us all to
get to the next step. And it probably is
modeled very nicely in the Google organization. So we published this in 2000. This is the New England
Journal of Medicine,",699.13,10.96,710.09,NA
"where our first seven
patients receiving islets under the Edmonton protocol--
that we called subsequently the Edmonton protocol--
where all the patients that had the transplants were able to
come off insulin and remain off insulin for a period of a years.",710.09,11.65,721.74,NA
"And in fact, now 15 years
later, two of the original 12 are still completely
insulin-free with full function. And we've just
refined this treatment over the course of time to
try and further improve it.",721.74,11.882000000000001,733.622,NA
"So this was what we call
the Edmonton protocol. We gave two sets
of islet infusions. Initially around 5,000
islets per kilogram based on the recipient's weight. And then we have
another infusion",733.622,10.252,743.8739999999999,NA
"to provide enough
cell mass to make it sufficient insulin
for the patient. Then we gave these two
anti-rejection drugs-- sirolimus and tacrolimus-- and
an antibody at the beginning. And we subsequently
changed these drugs now",743.874,10.481,754.355,NA
"to more standard drugs,
because we encountered quite a lot of side effects
from the sirolimus drug. But it was certainly
very successful in allowing us to
begin our first trials. We then replicated these
trials in Miami, Minnesota,",754.355,12.705,767.0600000000001,NA
"and in our own site in
Edmonton in 118 patients, and were able to replicate
this quite successfully in 82% percent of patients
coming off insulin. And then we moved forward with
the immune tolerance network and carried out a large
international trial",767.06,14.41,781.4699999999999,NA
"in the US and Europe, testing
the Edmonton protocol. And we published that too
in the New England Journal. So where are we today? So we've treated in
Edmonton over 200 patients-- 218 patients-- who've
received 460 transplants.",781.47,15.399000000000001,796.869,NA
"So you can see that
most patients require-- in our center at least--
two islet infusions to provide sufficient
mass for them to come off insulin
for a period of time. We've received in
Canada patients",796.869,9.231000000000002,806.1,NA
"from all across the country. Last year we did a record
number of islet transplants in Edmonton. We did 66 islet
transplants at Edmonton. And we're quite proud of that.",806.1,8.7,814.8000000000001,NA
"We've kept our teams very busy. Across the world,
currently there've been over 1,000 islet
transplants done at least 30 different
international sites. And so I'm going
to explain to you",814.8,12.915,827.7149999999999,NA
"know how we get the islets out. That was a picture,
by the way, of islets under a microscope stained
with a dithizone dye that stains the zinc. Because zinc and
insulin are very closely",827.715,8.545,836.26,NA
"linked Studying the
zinc inside the islet, so you can see then quite
clearly under the microscope. Those are very pure
islets ready for infusion. But we don't just get
the islets from anywhere. They come from a human pancreas.",836.26,9.459999999999999,845.72,NA
"So I'm just going to walk
you through this process, because it is quite a complex
process that our team has to do in Edmonton. So here they take
a pancreas, they canulate the pancreas duct.",845.72,10.82,856.5400000000001,NA
"And as we're going through
the video here on the right, I'll show you the
graph on the left there is all those little dots, sort
of like the stars in the night, every one of those represents
over 1,500 islet isolations done by our team over
the last 15 years.",856.54,13.097,869.637,NA
"There's a human
pancreas on the right, you can see it being distended
with collagenase enzymes before we chop it up and put it
in Camillo Ricordi's chamber. So there's Doug shaking
the chamber there. This team's a very
well-knit team.",869.637,13.669,883.3059999999999,NA
"They work day and night
to prepare the cells. Once the cells are
digested, then we purify them on a continuous
ficoll gradient on a cool code machine. And there's Doug and Tatsuya
and the team at Edmonton",883.306,14.350999999999999,897.657,NA
"that prepare these cells for us. They've done a
terrific job for us. You can't see that
graph on the right, it's a little too small for
you, but basically the number of islets they get
out of the pancreas",897.657,8.386000000000001,906.043,NA
"today is double
the number that we were able to get in
2000, when we first began the Edmonton protocol. And their success rate in
being able to take a pancreas and provide enough
cells to transplant",906.043,9.457,915.5,NA
"has also increased to
around 60% to 70% percent. The actual transplant
part is very, very simple. It doesn't require
a transplant surgeon to do this, fortunately. So the transplant is done
in the x-ray department",915.5,11.870000000000001,927.37,NA
"under local anesthetic. Here's a patient who
is awake, chatting away during the procedure. We use fluoroscopy x-ray so we
can see where the needle goes. We thread a catheter into
the main portal vein there,",927.37,11.7,939.07,NA
"and then we simply drip
the cells in under gravity. And we measure the
portal pressure while we do this, we give
heparin to prevent blood clotting at the end, before
we pull that catheter out. Because we learned this perhaps
in our first early cases,",939.07,15.380999999999998,954.451,NA
"when we pulled the
catheter out of the liver, we initially got bleeding. So we found that when we put
this paste in along the track as we pull it out, we
mix it up with contrast so that we can see it being
injected on the x-ray screen.",954.451,11.259,965.71,NA
"You'll see that in a second
here as we load the syringe, this is Aventine paste. So as we pull the catheter out,
we plug the track in the liver. And that has eliminated
the risk of complications such as bleeding after
the islet transplant",965.71,11.76,977.47,NA
"So this is a very
safe procedure. And if we look at the
number of patients we've treated over the course
of time now, 97% of patients survive. And these are
patients, of course,",977.47,8.879999999999999,986.35,NA
"who have had longstanding
diabetes, who are at risk of many
different things. And of the few deaths that
we've encountered over 15 years have been mainly
cardiovascular deaths in patients with
longstanding diabetes.",986.35,10.943999999999999,997.294,NA
"So heart attacks, basically. So we've had four patients
die of heart attacks. One patient had a possible
Creutzfeld-Jakob disease. And one patient had
fatal hypoglycemia after an early transplant
where the cells failed.",997.294,13.226,1010.52,NA
"So none of these deaths have
been related to the transplant or to the anti-rejection
drug treatment today. So this has been a
very safe transplant, certainly the safest transplant
that I've been involved in. There have been adverse events.",1010.52,12.57,1023.09,NA
"We can go through
these, but I won't go to them in too much detail. A couple of patients
over 15 years-- 1.4%-- needed to go on to get
a kidney transplant, because the drug we give to
prevent rejection to crolimus",1023.09,11.17,1034.26,NA
"does have kidney side effects. Now what about performance? Are we doing better over time? So if we look at the
function of cells over time, in the red line here.",1034.26,9.055,1043.315,NA
"So every molecule
of insulin that's made by the cells,
another molecule is made called C-peptide. And we can measure the
C-peptide in the bloodstream with a simple blood test.",1046.3,9.850000000000001,1056.1499999999999,NA
"So you can see that over
the course of 15 years, 73% of patients continue
to make C-peptide to a sufficient degree that
controls the hemoglobin A1c, therefore reduces
their risk of getting the complications of
diabetes, and prevents",1056.15,13.23,1069.38,NA
"the patients from getting
hypoglycemic events. So this is a real advance,
particularly for patients that have really recalcitrant
risk of hypoglycemia. So these patients are
very well protected. But what we did see in the
early Edmonton protocol series",1069.38,13.16,1082.5400000000002,NA
"is that a large
number of patients did need to go back on to
small amounts of insulin-- around 15% of patients--
by the 15-year mark. And so we've spent
a lot of effort now in the last
several years seeing",1082.54,10.25,1092.79,NA
"if we can improve these results
over the course of time. And if you can think of
the number of the cells that we transplant in to
liver here as a bucket, and the cells are being
lost through little holes in the bucket, we've
been working in science",1092.79,11.590000000000002,1104.3799999999999,NA
"to see if we can plug
the holes in the bucket to try to allow more cells
to survive over time. So we've been looking
at various pathways to reduce early
damage to the cells, trying to prevent them from
being rejected and preventing",1104.38,10.74,1115.1200000000001,NA
"leg graft loss, and
then really trying to improve the number
of cells that we put in at the beginning, so that
we can have many, many more patients with fuller
function and more durable function over time.",1115.12,10.559999999999999,1125.6799999999998,NA
"Now because type 1 diabetes
is an autoimmune condition, as we mentioned
at the beginning, there is a risk of the
autoimmunity coming back again. And here's a patient's
biopsy-- and I won't go through
too much details--",1125.68,10.870000000000001,1136.55,NA
"but you can see on
the right hand side, there are islets
surviving quite well, but no beta cells in
