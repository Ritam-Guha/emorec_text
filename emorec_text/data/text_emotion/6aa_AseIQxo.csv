hi I'm Stephanie and the physical,12.559,3.941,16.5,NA
therapist that in motion LC and today,14.58,3.24,17.82,neutral
I'm going to educate you a little bit on,16.5,3.6,20.1,neutral
performer alpha P so personal morality,17.82,4.44,22.26,neutral
is a big fancy word that really just,20.1,4.71,24.810000000000002,neutral
refers to a diseased or damaged and two,22.26,4.83,27.090000000000003,neutral
peripheral nerves so there are nerves on,24.81,4.17,28.979999999999997,neutral
multiple layers of the spine that run,27.09,3.449,30.539,neutral
out from their sign two different,28.98,4.02,33.0,neutral
muscles in your hands arms legs feet,30.539,4.381,34.92,neutral
kind of run all the way out and control,33.0,4.17,37.17,sad
the motions on that take place in your,34.92,4.229,39.149,sad
upper and lower body so with this,37.17,4.799,41.969,sad
disease progresses kind of in a stacking,39.149,4.771,43.92,sad
our gloves pattern starts in their hands,41.969,3.481,45.45,sad
and your feet and kind of moves upwards,43.92,3.78,47.7,neutral
it's most common with people on with,45.45,4.289,49.739000000000004,neutral
diabetes it can be due to variety of,47.7,4.499,52.199000000000005,neutral
causes different Texas cities on,49.739,4.201,53.94,neutral
different infections so there are lots,52.199,3.211,55.41,sad
of different causes the diabetes is,53.94,3.869,57.809,sad
definitely on the big one so this takes,55.41,4.289,59.699,neutral
over and not only affects the sensory,57.809,3.511,61.32,neutral
part of the nerves but also the motor,59.699,2.971,62.67,neutral
there's two different components of,61.32,3.869,65.18900000000001,neutral
every nerve with the sensation it can be,62.67,4.59,67.26,neutral
really undamaged because you're not,65.189,4.261,69.44999999999999,neutral
really able to tell when your foot is in,67.26,3.929,71.18900000000001,NA
contact with something for an example,69.45,3.66,73.11,fear
you might have a rock in your shoe and,71.189,3.811,75.0,sad
forearm you knew we'd be able to tell,73.11,3.57,76.67999999999999,sad
right away that the rock is in the shoe,75.0,2.97,77.97,fear
you want to have you know take your shoe,76.68,4.079,80.759,NA
off or I move our feet around but people,77.97,4.829,82.79899999999999,NA
with this damage they don't necessarily,80.759,4.751,85.51,neutral
know that is fair to looking pod,82.799,4.871,87.67,neutral
of course an alternate Cardinal break,85.51,3.96,89.47,NA
through the skin and then it won't,87.67,3.72,91.39,NA
necessarily feel as well because there,89.47,3.63,93.1,sad
doesn't have that same type of sensation,91.39,3.87,95.26,sad
so if you really lead to a lot of damage,93.1,5.16,98.25999999999999,fear
going further into you know progress all,95.26,4.77,100.03,neutral
servers imputation it can be very,98.26,4.59,102.85000000000001,neutral
serious so this is something that is,100.03,4.02,104.05,sad
really important to make sure you're,102.85,3.27,106.11999999999999,sad
taken care of right away foot care is,104.05,3.48,107.53,sad
essential for people with peripheral,106.12,4.11,110.23,sad
neuropathy and it also impacts more the,107.53,5.07,112.6,sad
motor component of being able to move,110.23,4.65,114.88000000000001,neutral
your feet and toes and the way you need,112.6,4.8,117.39999999999999,neutral
to so that it would be an area that we,114.88,4.08,118.96,neutral
look at making sure you're keeping the,117.4,3.84,121.24000000000001,neutral
strength that means your ability to move,118.96,4.019,122.979,neutral
and kind of live your life that's really,121.24,4.35,125.58999999999999,neutral
our focus here and fall risk is another,122.979,4.051,127.03,neutral
huge one because you don't necessarily,125.59,3.9,129.49,neutral
have feeling on the bottom of your feet,127.03,4.29,131.32,neutral
your most mere muscles aren't able to,129.49,3.87,133.36,neutral
control your foot in April as well and,131.32,3.66,134.98,neutral
then you don't have the awareness called,133.36,3.06,136.42000000000002,sad
proprioception you really don't know,134.98,3.54,138.51999999999998,neutral
where your foot is in space all three of,136.42,4.32,140.73999999999998,neutral
those components really make us you at a,138.52,4.35,142.87,fear
larger risk for experiencing a fault,140.74,4.02,144.76000000000002,fear
which of course is nothing that we want,142.87,4.8,147.67000000000002,neutral
to have happen so here at emotional OC,144.76,4.86,149.62,neutral
all reputable therapists are experts,147.67,3.75,151.42,neutral
with this condition a lot of different,149.62,3.57,153.19,surprise
techniques be there kind of helped,151.42,4.56,155.98,fear
openers maintain their function learn,153.19,5.34,158.53,sad
different from most motor patterns or,155.98,4.38,160.35999999999999,neutral
commencer ways to make sure that you're,158.53,4.92,163.45,neutral
staying active staying healthy avoiding,160.36,4.92,165.28,neutral
any Falls and of course avoiding a new,163.45,4.26,167.70999999999998,neutral
sort of ulcer so come on in motion,165.28,4.75,170.03,neutral
