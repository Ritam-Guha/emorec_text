You drive your elbows into the ground.,48.37,1.6,49.97,

delts to try to get you up and off the ground.",66.71,4.839,71.54899999999999,

to stick it, hold the contraction, and make",71.549,4.461,76.01,fear
"sure that you got up there because of the
back and not because of momentum.",76.01,3.23,79.24000000000001,fear

or the meaty area of our back.",79.24,4.169,83.40899999999999,sad
"Yes, we can work this, too.",83.409,1.621,85.03,sad

a slick floor.",94.06,2.839,96.899,

This is concrete.,98.85,1.379,100.229,
"I can do it, though.",100.229,1.0,101.229,
"A little more friction, but it's going to
make it a little tougher than if you had a",101.229,3.92,105.149,
"hardwood floor, or linoleum floor, or something
like that.",105.149,2.39,107.539,

I have my arms all the way out straight in",110.659,3.791,114.45,

complete, total body pull down, or pull over,",114.45,5.419,119.869,

Then I lower myself back down.,123.079,1.561,124.63999999999999,

or at least a straight arm pull down.",124.64,5.68,130.32,

exercise.",130.32,3.12,133.44,fear
"To make it more difficult go all the way back
up onto your toes at the end.",133.44,4.17,137.60999999999999,

shin against the ground until you're up to",141.22,4.02,145.24,
"the point where you can then pull the rest
of your body up.",145.24,2.73,147.97,
"So you can unweight some of your body by allowing
your knees and shins to touch the ground.",147.97,3.73,151.7,sad
"Finally, sort of a combo exercise.",151.7,1.8,153.5,sad
"I think one of the most important things for
you to do when you're training your lower",153.5,2.641,156.141,fear
"back is to train it with the muscles it prefers
to work with.",156.141,2.819,158.95999999999998,sad
"So it likes to get some help from the gluts,
and it's also going to like to get some help",158.96,3.47,162.43,sad
"from above from the lats that obviously tie
into your low back.",162.43,4.01,166.44,sad

basically, a Superman.",166.44,4.3,170.74,fear
"We're going to do it with our arms behind
our body though and you can see very subtly",170.74,4.0,174.74,
"that I'm actually rotating my shoulders back
with each repetition.",174.74,3.52,178.26000000000002,
"So I'm even trying to get a little bit of
external rotation to get the back here, and",178.26,4.41,182.67,
our rotator cuff involved.,182.67,1.49,184.16,
"So I'm actually getting a little external
rotation and obviously the squeeze of the",184.16,4.34,188.5,
"lats and then of course, the gluts and low
back working together too.",188.5,3.35,191.85,
"Here, the important thing is how long you
hold it for.",191.85,2.69,194.54,
"Try to hold it, or stick that contraction
again for two to three seconds so that you",194.54,3.572,198.112,
"can make sure that the muscles you want are
doing the job and not just momentum.",198.112,3.848,201.96,

only mean you have no options.",201.96,3.75,205.71,sad
"As a matter of fact, some of these exercises
– like the second one in particular – are",205.71,4.41,210.12,sad
"so damn hard that you might have to dial them
back.",210.12,3.11,213.23000000000002,sad
"So that doesn't mean you have to compromise
on the difficulty of the exercise and therefore",213.23,3.67,216.89999999999998,sad
"the results that you can get from doing them
if you're stuck at home using bodyweight only.",216.9,3.73,220.63,sad
"If you use a little bit of creativity like
I said, and you understand the concept of",220.63,3.33,223.96,sad
overload you can get the job done.,223.96,2.03,225.99,sad
