hi everyone happy new year,7.639,5.531,13.17,sad
I'm Cheryl Christian from low-gi meals,10.71,7.68,18.39,sad
and I am a passionate fitness person but,13.17,7.26,20.43,sad
I'm also very very passionate about,18.39,4.799,23.189,sad
teaching nutrition I myself did not,20.43,4.679,25.109,sad
understand the correlation of how,23.189,4.561,27.75,sad
important it was to eat right to get the,25.109,4.801,29.910000000000004,sad
best out of your workout and to live a,27.75,4.38,32.13,sad
really healthy lifestyle so I want to,29.91,5.37,35.28,sad
start off with just a very few simple,32.13,5.46,37.59,sad
points there are six classes of,35.28,3.9,39.18,neutral
nutrients let's start with that so you,37.59,4.05,41.64,sad
have your carbohydrates proteins and,39.18,4.92,44.1,sad
fats and then there's vitamins minerals,41.64,4.649,46.289,sad
and water I only want to talk right now,44.1,4.139,48.239000000000004,sad
about the first three because those are,46.289,3.36,49.649,sad
the ones that are going to provide an,48.239,4.021,52.26,sad
energy source to you and fuel your,49.649,5.82,55.469,sad
activities so what I want to also talk,52.26,4.77,57.03,sad
about is the importance of the low,55.469,4.531,60.0,sad
glycemic index now a lot of people are,57.03,4.829,61.859,sad
just starting to hear about this so I'm,60.0,4.409,64.409,sad
going to try and quickly explain what,61.859,4.651,66.51,sad
it's all about to you so first of all,64.409,5.011,69.42,sad
we're talking about carbohydrates so in,66.51,4.92,71.43,sad
that food group you're going we're,69.42,6.269,75.68900000000001,sad
talking about your breads rice pastas,71.43,6.299,77.72900000000001,sad
your fruits and vegetables these are all,75.689,5.22,80.90899999999999,fear
carbohydrates they give you energy,77.729,6.721,84.45,sad
sometimes instant energy we don't want,80.909,5.221,86.13000000000001,sad
you to focus on those foods that give,84.45,3.36,87.81,sad
you instant energy and I'm going to tell,86.13,4.41,90.53999999999999,sad
you why right now here's my chart and,87.81,4.26,92.07000000000001,sad
let's just say in the morning you have,90.54,4.59,95.13000000000001,fear
at breakfast and you have let's just say,92.07,6.119,98.189,sad
whole-wheat toast and some juice those,95.13,5.76,100.89,sad
foods break down very quickly to blood,98.189,4.621,102.80999999999999,sad
glucose or blood sugar okay they're,100.89,3.6,104.49,sad
gonna break down into a sugar in your,102.81,4.379,107.18900000000001,sad
system they're going to raise your blood,104.49,5.37,109.86,sad
Sugar's really quickly and what happens,107.189,5.101,112.28999999999999,sad
at that peak point is the body's,109.86,5.31,115.17,sad
pancreas is going to release insulin now,112.29,6.0,118.29,sad
insulins job is to drive that energy,115.17,5.46,120.63,sad
into the muscles so we can be active and,118.29,5.219,123.509,sad
have lots of energy but what's happening,120.63,6.36,126.99,sad
now is we are getting too much a surge,123.509,6.631,130.14,sad
from a lot of our refined products that,126.99,5.34,132.32999999999998,sad
we're eating when that happens,130.14,5.91,136.04999999999998,sad
when the insulin drives the blood sugars,132.33,8.76,141.09,fear
down you have this fast rise and a fast,136.05,7.68,143.73000000000002,sad
drop when you bottomed out you become,141.09,4.95,146.04,sad
hypoglycemic and you often become a,143.73,4.68,148.41,sad
little bit shaky you don't feel so good,146.04,3.96,150.0,sad
and what happens you start craving,148.41,3.9,152.31,sad
carbohydrates again you want something,150.0,4.14,154.14,sad
sweet a sticky bun you want something,152.31,4.53,156.84,sad
some chocolate you want another cup of,154.14,5.1,159.23999999999998,sad
coffee because you're feeling low your,156.84,4.89,161.73,sad
Energy's down so what happens we eat,159.24,5.75,164.99,fear
those carbohydrates back we go up and,161.73,6.84,168.57,fear
again insulin is secreted from the,164.99,6.46,171.45000000000002,sad
pancreas and if we have too much of this,168.57,5.7,174.26999999999998,sad
insulin it is a fat storage hormone so,171.45,5.13,176.57999999999998,sad
this overabundance of insulin,174.27,4.74,179.01000000000002,sad
circulating in our system actually puts,176.58,5.82,182.4,sad
us into a weight gain mode so that's not,179.01,5.79,184.79999999999998,sad
what we want and we call this the roller,182.4,4.53,186.93,fear
coaster effect we eat a high glycemic,184.8,4.56,189.36,sad
food we crash we eat a high glycemic,186.93,4.86,191.79000000000002,sad
food we crash what we want to do is,189.36,4.44,193.8,sad
bring our blood Sugar's down so when we,191.79,3.96,195.75,sad
eat a low glycemic breakfast choice so,193.8,4.05,197.85000000000002,sad
let's just say we're having some yogurt,195.75,3.69,199.44,fear
and fruit would be a great choice and,197.85,3.81,201.66,sad
there's so many other wonderful choices,199.44,4.41,203.85,sad
you could have your blood Sugar's just,201.66,6.36,208.02,sad
rise slowly and they come down slowly we,203.85,6.03,209.88,sad
are now in control of what we're eating,208.02,5.34,213.36,sad
our energy supply is more constant we're,209.88,5.42,215.29999999999998,sad
not getting that huge fluctuation so,213.36,5.04,218.4,sad
we're now our body is able to start,215.3,6.61,221.91000000000003,sad
releasing body fat plus we have,218.4,6.09,224.49,sad
consistent energy so I'm quickly going,221.91,5.4,227.31,sad
to show you a few food choices that you,224.49,5.7,230.19,NA
might want to consider click cook,227.31,4.77,232.08,NA
oatmeal is actually really high on the,230.19,5.73,235.92,NA
glycemic index anything can over 65 to a,232.08,6.26,238.34,NA
hundred is considered high glycemic,235.92,4.74,240.66,NA
whereas a slow cook oatmeal is only,238.34,5.22,243.56,NA
forty to sixty so much better choice,240.66,5.69,246.35,NA
pasta you can have pasta but we,243.56,5.05,248.61,NA
recommend you go al dente so it's,246.35,4.45,250.79999999999998,sad
slightly undercooked rather than that,248.61,4.44,253.05,sad
overcooked pasta which can send your,250.8,5.58,256.38,sad
blood sugars rising so quickly there's,253.05,5.4,258.45,sad
some good cereals on the market but not,256.38,4.289,260.669,sad
too many people are surprised like bran,258.45,4.26,262.71,sad
flakes cheerios etc can be very high,260.669,2.531,263.2,sad
glassing,262.71,2.05,264.76,sad
Micke they actually break down into,263.2,4.44,267.64,sad
sugar really quickly in your system for,264.76,4.65,269.40999999999997,sad
those who are vegetarian there's awesome,267.64,5.16,272.8,sad
choices so the legumes quinoa if you,269.41,5.19,274.6,sad
haven't tried it as a great source it's,272.8,4.74,277.54,sad
a protein in a carbohydrate sweet,274.6,5.82,280.42,sad
potatoes versus a whole white potato a,277.54,4.86,282.40000000000003,sad
russet potato russet potatoes are really,280.42,5.16,285.58000000000004,sad
high glycemic so simple choices dietary,282.4,5.4,287.79999999999995,sad
