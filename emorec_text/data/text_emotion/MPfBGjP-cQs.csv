hi everyone happy new year I'm Cheryl Christian from low-gi meals and I am a passionate fitness person but I'm also very very passionate about teaching nutrition I myself did not,7.639,29.948999999999998,37.588,angry
understand the correlation of how important it was to eat right to get the best out of your workout and to live a really healthy lifestyle so I want to start off with just a very few simple,23.189,24.572000000000003,47.761,angry
points there are six classes of nutrients let's start with that so you have your carbohydrates proteins and fats and then there's vitamins minerals and water I only want to talk right now,35.28,21.657999999999998,56.938,angry
about the first three because those are the ones that are going to provide an energy source to you and fuel your activities so what I want to also talk about is the importance of the low,46.289,22.502,68.791,angry
glycemic index now a lot of people are just starting to hear about this so I'm going to try and quickly explain what it's all about to you so first of all we're talking about carbohydrates so in,57.03,23.82,80.85,angry
that food group you're going we're talking about your breads rice pastas your fruits and vegetables these are all carbohydrates they give you energy sometimes instant energy we don't want,69.42,29.73,99.15,angry
you to focus on those foods that give you instant energy and I'm going to tell you why right now here's my chart and let's just say in the morning you have at breakfast and you have let's just say,84.45,22.738999999999997,107.189,angry
whole-wheat toast and some juice those foods break down very quickly to blood glucose or blood sugar okay they're gonna break down into a sugar in your system they're going to raise your blood,95.13,23.73,118.86,angry
Sugar's really quickly and what happens at that peak point is the body's pancreas is going to release insulin now insulins job is to drive that energy into the muscles so we can be active and,107.189,27.090000000000003,134.279,angry
have lots of energy but what's happening now is we are getting too much a surge from a lot of our refined products that we're eating when that happens when the insulin drives the blood sugars,120.63,33.001,153.631,angry
down you have this fast rise and a fast drop when you bottomed out you become hypoglycemic and you often become a little bit shaky you don't feel so good and what happens you start craving,136.05,25.169999999999998,161.22,angry
carbohydrates again you want something sweet a sticky bun you want something some chocolate you want another cup of coffee because you're feeling low your Energy's down so what happens we eat,150.0,24.41,174.41,angry
those carbohydrates back we go up and again insulin is secreted from the pancreas and if we have too much of this insulin it is a fat storage hormone so this overabundance of insulin,161.73,28.869999999999997,190.6,angry
circulating in our system actually puts us into a weight gain mode so that's not what we want and we call this the roller coaster effect we eat a high glycemic food we crash we eat a high glycemic,176.58,25.56,202.14000000000001,angry
food we crash what we want to do is bring our blood Sugar's down so when we eat a low glycemic breakfast choice so let's just say we're having some yogurt and fruit would be a great choice and,189.36,19.95,209.31,angry
there's so many other wonderful choices you could have your blood Sugar's just rise slowly and they come down slowly we are now in control of what we're eating our energy supply is more constant we're,199.44,27.560000000000002,227.0,NA
not getting that huge fluctuation so we're now our body is able to start releasing body fat plus we have consistent energy so I'm quickly going to show you a few food choices that you,213.36,28.84,242.20000000000002,NA
might want to consider click cook oatmeal is actually really high on the glycemic index anything can over 65 to a hundred is considered high glycemic whereas a slow cook oatmeal is only,227.31,26.72,254.03,NA
forty to sixty so much better choice pasta you can have pasta but we recommend you go al dente so it's slightly undercooked rather than that overcooked pasta which can send your,240.66,25.21,265.87,NA
blood sugars rising so quickly there's some good cereals on the market but not too many people are surprised like bran flakes cheerios etc can be very high glassing,253.05,18.53,271.58000000000004,NA
Micke they actually break down into sugar really quickly in your system for those who are vegetarian there's awesome choices so the legumes quinoa if you haven't tried it as a great source it's,263.2,24.18,287.38,angry
