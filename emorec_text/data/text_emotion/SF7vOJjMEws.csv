"The mechanism for low B12
with metformin, I don't think has been completely sorted out but it appears to
be a problem with absorption. [Music] It's not related to intrinsic factors so the classic pernicious anemia that we
all learned about in medical school",0.0,20.18,20.18,angry
"that's not really the mechanism but
there seems to be something about the effect of metformin in the gut that
impairs absorption. So we studied B12 levels in our metformin-treated
participants at two time-points during DPP. Unfortunately we didn't have samples
available at the very beginning, but we were able to measure samples after
people had been treated for roughly five",20.84,22.340000000000003,43.18000000000001,sad

treatment and we found that there was a significant prevalence of biochemical
B12 deficiency that was higher in the metformin-treated participants than in
the placebo group. It was approximately- depends on how you define B12 deficiency
which is sort of an issue unto itself- but people who had definitely low B12

9% after longer duration treatment. So what should we do
clinically at this point? Well, given what we know so far about the relationship
between metformin and B12 deficiency, I think there is some debate about whether
everyone should be - everyone taking metformin should be treated. There are
jokes about, ""Oh we should just add B12",72.68,22.35,95.03,angry

this problem."" I don't think we're quite there yet, I think in part because we
don't even know what the appropriate repletion
method would be, so we identify people who have low B12, they're taking
metformin. We think it's likely that oral supplementation will be adequate, but
that really hasn't been studied in any",95.03,22.049,117.07900000000001,angry

possibility of low B12 is important in patients who are being treated with
metformin. And you know, ADA guidelines came out this year for the first time
recommending periodic testing of B12 levels. One thing I will mention about
our findings in DPP that's relevant to the issue about how we deal
with this clinically is that from the",117.079,22.891,139.97,angry
"beginning of the DPP study, we were
aware of the relationship between metformin and low B12 and so we were
monitoring CBCs during the study. But we found in
our analysis of the b12 levels that the the presence of anemia did not
discriminate between who did or didn't have low B12 levels, so I think we may
have a false sense of security by",139.97,21.61,161.57999999999998,sad
"looking, by just analyzing hemoglobin and
hematocrit for example in our metformin treated patients, and I think that's one
of the reasons why guidelines are now starting to come out recommending
actual measurement of vitamin B12. I think it's hard at this point to have a
precise recommendation for when to begin measuring but I think within a few years
of starting metformin is probably when I",161.58,21.689,183.269,sad
"would start to consider doing it. So the
question clinically is whether we should be treating all patients who are taking
metformin with a vitamin B12 supplement or whether we should be testing them.
What's the most cost effective approach? I think that one could make an argument
for providing B12 supplement to everyone who is taking metformin, but the one
caveat to that is that I don't think",183.269,23.22,206.489,sad
"that the appropriate treatment regimen
has really been clearly identified. We believe, we expect that higher doses of
vitamin B12 will overcome the malabsorption that's associated with
metformin, but we don't know that for sure and I think it would be somewhat
risky to recommend routine supplementation without some
measurement of vitamin B12 levels at",206.489,23.25,229.739,angry

was malabsorption that had been overcome. The question can come up whether the
risk of vitamin B12 deficiency might be a factor in a decision to actually
prescribe metformin. Should this be a reason to avoid prescribing metformin,

administered medications that we could",229.739,22.771,252.51,NA

that's probably not warranted. There's so many benefits to metformin, such an
excellent safety profile and inexpensive, readily affordable, readily available
drug, that I think that it can be safely prescribed as long as the potential for
B12 deficiency is is recognized and monitored.",252.51,22.18,274.69,sad
