hi it's tracy if you have diabetes in,0.32,4.56,4.88,fear
pregnancy one of the things you're,3.36,3.28,6.64,fear
probably wondering is,4.88,4.639,9.519,fear
what effect high blood sugar has on the,6.64,3.84,10.48,fear
baby,9.519,3.2,12.719000000000001,fear
and there's several answers to that,10.48,5.73,16.21,fear
let's dig in,12.719,4.961,17.68,fear
[Music],16.21,3.229,19.439,fear
one of the first things to remember is,17.68,3.679,21.358999999999998,fear
that babies blood sugars,19.439,3.6,23.039,fear
are going to be pretty close to whatever,21.359,3.281,24.64,fear
your blood sugar level is,23.039,4.32,27.359,fear
at any given time and if the baby's,24.64,4.559,29.199,fear
getting all this glucose from you,27.359,4.72,32.079,fear
then right after delivery when the cord,29.199,4.161,33.36,fear
is clamped and cut,32.079,3.361,35.44,fear
then their blood sugars just plummet,33.36,3.84,37.2,fear
because they're still making all this,35.44,2.4,37.839999999999996,fear
insulin,37.2,2.96,40.160000000000004,fear
trying to get their blood sugars down,37.84,3.84,41.68000000000001,fear
and if they're not getting the glucose,40.16,3.6,43.76,fear
anymore then their blood sugars go way,41.68,2.719,44.399,fear
down,43.76,2.319,46.079,fear
this is a problem sometimes in the,44.399,3.041,47.44,fear
newborn period,46.079,3.441,49.52,fear
so you'll be asked to feed your baby,47.44,3.439,50.879,fear
right away,49.52,3.199,52.719,fear
put the baby right to the breast or,50.879,3.36,54.239,fear
however you're going to feed the baby,52.719,3.201,55.92,fear
the baby is going to need some source of,54.239,4.0,58.239,fear
glucose very shortly after delivery,55.92,4.4,60.32,fear
to keep the blood sugars from going down,58.239,3.441,61.68,fear
so one thing you should be thinking,60.32,1.84,62.160000000000004,fear
about,61.68,2.24,63.92,fear
when you're managing your diabetes in,62.16,4.319,66.479,fear
pregnancy is how those high blood sugars,63.92,4.879,68.799,fear
are making the baby's blood sugars high,66.479,4.32,70.799,fear
and in the last few weeks leading up to,68.799,3.281,72.08000000000001,fear
delivery how important,70.799,4.401,75.2,fear
it is to keep your blood sugars solid,72.08,4.8,76.88,fear
so that the baby's blood sugars don't,75.2,3.44,78.64,surprise
fall right after delivery,76.88,3.44,80.32,fear
some babies have to get admitted to the,78.64,3.2,81.84,fear
intensive care nursery for this,80.32,3.6,83.91999999999999,fear
sometimes they require iv,81.84,4.72,86.56,fear
fluids and iv glucose just to manage,83.92,3.04,86.96000000000001,fear
this,86.56,2.4,88.96000000000001,fear
the second thing to remember is that,86.96,3.04,90.0,fear
babies grow,88.96,3.68,92.64,fear
bigger when moms have high blood sugar,90.0,3.92,93.92,fear
and here's the reason,92.64,2.88,95.52,fear
they're getting a lot of blood sugar,93.92,3.76,97.68,fear
from you if your sugars are high,95.52,4.239,99.759,fear
that glucose kind of slides downhill to,97.68,4.079,101.759,fear
the baby and when their glucoses are,99.759,4.081,103.84,fear
elevated they make a lot more insulin,101.759,3.68,105.43900000000001,fear
and along with that insulin they're,103.84,2.08,105.92,fear
making,105.439,2.801,108.24,fear
all kinds of hormones that make them,105.92,3.04,108.96000000000001,fear
store,108.24,3.68,111.92,fear
fat so the same way that you gain weight,108.96,4.56,113.52,fear
when you eat too many calories or,111.92,2.159,114.07900000000001,fear
especially,113.52,2.959,116.479,fear
too many carbs the babies are starting,114.079,3.921,118.0,fear
to put on weight too,116.479,3.841,120.32,fear
and that in turn leads to an increased,118.0,3.84,121.84,fear
risk of birth injuries,120.32,3.439,123.75899999999999,surprise
the head is supposed to be the biggest,121.84,3.84,125.68,fear
part of a baby and it's supposed to come,123.759,3.761,127.52,fear
out first so that the rest of the body,125.68,2.48,128.16,fear
just slides,127.52,2.879,130.399,fear
right out when you have diabetes in,128.16,4.24,132.4,fear
pregnancy and if your blood sugars are,130.399,2.801,133.2,fear
high,132.4,2.88,135.28,fear
then baby's blood sugars are high and,133.2,3.759,136.95899999999997,fear
they tend to put on more weight,135.28,3.84,139.12,fear
through the shoulders and abdomen and,136.959,4.241,141.2,fear
what this means for the birth process,139.12,4.56,143.68,fear
is that the head's not the biggest part,141.2,4.32,145.51999999999998,fear
of the baby anymore and sometimes the,143.68,2.96,146.64000000000001,fear
head comes out,145.52,3.04,148.56,fear
and then the shoulder and abdomen don't,146.64,4.08,150.72,fear
want to come out and that's a condition,148.56,4.319,152.879,fear
called shoulder dystocia and it's,150.72,3.2,153.92,happy
terrifying for,152.879,4.161,157.04,fear
your provider and for you because those,153.92,3.84,157.76,fear
seconds,157.04,3.279,160.319,fear
that it takes to do the maneuvers to get,157.76,4.16,161.92,fear
the baby to come on out,160.319,3.601,163.92,fear
and while that's happening the baby's,161.92,4.48,166.39999999999998,fear
not getting any blood flow or oxygen,163.92,4.48,168.39999999999998,fear
so we want the head to stay the biggest,166.4,3.119,169.519,happy
part of the baby,168.4,2.4,170.8,happy
keep your blood sugars under good,169.519,3.681,173.20000000000002,fear
control the third effect that your high,170.8,4.32,175.12,fear
blood sugar can have on the baby,173.2,3.679,176.879,surprise
is really part of the second thing when,175.12,3.759,178.879,surprise
babies are born big they're more likely,176.879,2.881,179.76,fear
to have birth,178.879,3.921,182.79999999999998,fear
injuries so remember that the shoulders,179.76,5.199,184.959,fear
can have a difficult time delivering,182.8,4.719,187.519,fear
and when that happens they can have,184.959,3.761,188.72,fear
shoulder injuries,187.519,3.521,191.04,fear
most of the time these are temporary but,188.72,3.599,192.319,fear
sometimes they can cause,191.04,4.0,195.04,fear
lasting damage the fourth effect that,192.319,4.64,196.95899999999997,fear
your high blood sugar can have on your,195.04,2.72,197.76,fear
baby,196.959,3.761,200.72,fear
involves the baby's childhood risk of,197.76,5.44,203.2,fear
metabolic disorders and obesity,200.72,5.12,205.84,fear
so we've known for a long time that,203.2,4.64,207.83999999999997,fear
children of diabetic mothers,205.84,4.319,210.159,fear
tend to have a higher risk of obesity,207.84,4.8,212.64000000000001,fear
and developing diabetes themselves,210.159,4.0,214.159,fear
but we've thought that that's just,212.64,4.239,216.879,fear
because of lifestyle factors,214.159,4.961,219.12,fear
so moms that don't eat well or take care,216.879,3.36,220.239,fear
of themselves well,219.12,4.0,223.12,fear
teach those habits to their children and,220.239,4.64,224.879,fear
then the children grow up with poor,223.12,3.759,226.879,fear
eating habits or nutritional habits,224.879,4.64,229.51899999999998,fear
what we know now is that even if you,226.879,3.681,230.56,fear
feed your children,229.519,3.681,233.20000000000002,fear
perfectly after delivery your blood,230.56,4.72,235.28,fear
sugars during the pregnancy have a,233.2,5.119,238.319,fear
lasting sometimes lifelong effect on the,235.28,4.8,240.08,fear
baby's metabolism and their,238.319,4.081,242.39999999999998,fear
risk of becoming diabetic or having a,240.08,3.12,243.20000000000002,fear
problem with,242.4,3.28,245.68,fear
obesity starting in childhood the last,243.2,3.92,247.11999999999998,fear
complication is the most,245.68,4.24,249.92000000000002,fear
serious one if your glucoses are not,247.12,4.56,251.68,fear
well controlled in pregnancy and your,249.92,3.2,253.11999999999998,fear
baby's growing bigger,251.68,3.44,255.12,fear
or your glucoses are bouncing around,253.12,4.56,257.68,surprise
going from very high to very low,255.12,4.56,259.68,
there's an increased risk of stillbirth,257.68,4.079,261.759,
and that means a pregnancy loss,259.68,4.16,263.84000000000003,
the closer you get to your due date and,261.759,3.601,265.36,
the longer your glucoses are,263.84,2.32,266.15999999999997,
uncontrolled,265.36,3.52,268.88,NA
the higher this risk becomes fortunately,266.16,5.28,271.44,NA
stillbirth is a rare event but i don't,268.88,4.319,273.199,NA
want this to happen to you,271.44,4.08,275.52,NA
so you can see that having high blood,273.199,3.921,277.12,NA
sugar in pregnancy,275.52,4.0,279.52,NA
has an effect on your baby not just now,277.12,4.4,281.52,NA
but sometimes all through childhood and,279.52,3.679,283.19899999999996,NA
even lifelong,281.52,4.48,286.0,NA
so remember when you have diabetes in,283.199,4.881,288.08000000000004,NA
pregnancy it's so important for you to,286.0,3.28,289.28,NA
follow your diet,288.08,2.96,291.03999999999996,NA
for you to have regular check-ins with,289.28,4.08,293.35999999999996,NA
your provider and keep your glucoses,291.04,3.84,294.88,NA
under the best control,293.36,3.6,296.96000000000004,NA
