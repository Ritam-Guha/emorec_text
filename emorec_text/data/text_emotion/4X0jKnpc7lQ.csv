hi it's tracy if you have diabetes in pregnancy one of the things you're probably wondering is what effect high blood sugar has on the baby,0.32,19.519,19.839,angry
and there's several answers to that let's dig in [Music] one of the first things to remember is that babies blood sugars,10.48,21.199,31.679000000000002,angry
are going to be pretty close to whatever your blood sugar level is at any given time and if the baby's getting all this glucose from you then right after delivery when the cord,21.359,21.040999999999997,42.4,angry
is clamped and cut then their blood sugars just plummet because they're still making all this insulin trying to get their blood sugars down,32.079,16.401,48.480000000000004,angry
and if they're not getting the glucose anymore then their blood sugars go way down this is a problem sometimes in the newborn period,40.16,15.120000000000001,55.28,fear
so you'll be asked to feed your baby right away put the baby right to the breast or however you're going to feed the baby the baby is going to need some source of,47.44,17.198999999999998,64.639,fear
glucose very shortly after delivery to keep the blood sugars from going down so one thing you should be thinking about when you're managing your diabetes in,55.92,16.240000000000002,72.16,fear
pregnancy is how those high blood sugars are making the baby's blood sugars high and in the last few weeks leading up to delivery how important it is to keep your blood sugars solid,63.92,21.681,85.601,angry
so that the baby's blood sugars don't fall right after delivery some babies have to get admitted to the intensive care nursery for this sometimes they require iv,75.2,18.4,93.6,angry
fluids and iv glucose just to manage this the second thing to remember is that babies grow bigger when moms have high blood sugar,83.92,16.08,100.0,angry
and here's the reason they're getting a lot of blood sugar from you if your sugars are high that glucose kind of slides downhill to the baby and when their glucoses are,92.64,19.038999999999998,111.679,angry
elevated they make a lot more insulin and along with that insulin they're making all kinds of hormones that make them store,101.759,15.280999999999999,117.03999999999999,fear
fat so the same way that you gain weight when you eat too many calories or especially too many carbs the babies are starting to put on weight too,108.96,17.439999999999998,126.39999999999999,fear
and that in turn leads to an increased risk of birth injuries the head is supposed to be the biggest part of a baby and it's supposed to come out first so that the rest of the body,118.0,17.36,135.36,angry
just slides right out when you have diabetes in pregnancy and if your blood sugars are high then baby's blood sugars are high and,127.52,16.559,144.079,angry
they tend to put on more weight through the shoulders and abdomen and what this means for the birth process is that the head's not the biggest part of the baby anymore and sometimes the,135.28,19.921,155.201,angry
head comes out and then the shoulder and abdomen don't want to come out and that's a condition called shoulder dystocia and it's terrifying for,145.52,18.799999999999997,164.32,angry
your provider and for you because those seconds that it takes to do the maneuvers to get the baby to come on out and while that's happening the baby's,153.92,19.36,173.27999999999997,angry
not getting any blood flow or oxygen so we want the head to stay the biggest part of the baby keep your blood sugars under good control the third effect that your high,163.92,18.0,181.92,angry
blood sugar can have on the baby is really part of the second thing when babies are born big they're more likely to have birth injuries so remember that the shoulders,173.2,19.439,192.63899999999998,angry
can have a difficult time delivering and when that happens they can have shoulder injuries most of the time these are temporary but sometimes they can cause,182.8,19.6,202.4,angry
lasting damage the fourth effect that your high blood sugar can have on your baby involves the baby's childhood risk of metabolic disorders and obesity,192.319,21.681,214.0,angry
so we've known for a long time that children of diabetic mothers tend to have a higher risk of obesity and developing diabetes themselves but we've thought that that's just,203.2,21.998,225.19799999999998,angry
because of lifestyle factors so moms that don't eat well or take care of themselves well teach those habits to their children and then the children grow up with poor,214.159,20.72,234.879,angry
eating habits or nutritional habits what we know now is that even if you feed your children perfectly after delivery your blood sugars during the pregnancy have a,224.879,21.840999999999998,246.72,angry
lasting sometimes lifelong effect on the baby's metabolism and their risk of becoming diabetic or having a problem with obesity starting in childhood the last,235.28,19.201,254.481,fear
complication is the most serious one if your glucoses are not well controlled in pregnancy and your baby's growing bigger or your glucoses are bouncing around,245.68,20.0,265.68,fear
going from very high to very low there's an increased risk of stillbirth and that means a pregnancy loss the closer you get to your due date and the longer your glucoses are,255.12,18.72,273.84000000000003,NA
uncontrolled the higher this risk becomes fortunately stillbirth is a rare event but i don't want this to happen to you so you can see that having high blood,265.36,21.119999999999997,286.48,NA
sugar in pregnancy has an effect on your baby not just now but sometimes all through childhood and even lifelong so remember when you have diabetes in,275.52,21.44,296.96,NA
pregnancy it's so important for you to follow your diet for you to have regular check-ins with your provider and keep your glucoses under the best control,286.0,17.76,303.76,NA
