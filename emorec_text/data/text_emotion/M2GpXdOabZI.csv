the ACIP has just made a new,8.42,4.929,13.349,fear
recommendation for the use of hepatitis,11.16,5.82,16.98,neutral
B vaccine in diabetic adults and the,13.349,6.6,19.948999999999998,neutral
focus is on adults under 60 years of age,16.98,4.86,21.84,neutral
and whom the vaccine is most effective,19.949,5.131,25.080000000000002,neutral
and most cost-effective and so all,21.84,5.849,27.689,neutral
adults under 60 who have diabetes are,25.08,4.859,29.939,neutral
now recommended to receive the,27.689,4.771,32.46,neutral
three-dose hepatitis B vaccine series,29.939,5.931,35.87,neutral
for adults 60 years of age and above,32.46,5.34,37.8,neutral
physicians need to take into,35.87,4.24,40.11,sad
consideration the risk of exposure and,37.8,6.06,43.86,neutral
the primary risk that we know is present,40.11,7.26,47.37,neutral
is adults who live in assisted living or,43.86,5.64,49.5,neutral
skilled nursing facilities who have,47.37,4.439,51.809,sad
assisted blood glucose monitoring,49.5,4.949,54.449,sad
occurring very frequently and those,51.809,5.73,57.539,sad
adults are at increased risk to get,54.449,5.571,60.019999999999996,neutral
hepatitis B and for them we would also,57.539,5.25,62.789,neutral
encourage physicians to consider a,60.02,4.929,64.949,neutral
recommendation for vaccination on a,62.789,5.58,68.369,neutral
case-by-case basis what this means is,64.949,5.131,70.08,neutral
there's a new group of physicians who,68.369,3.871,72.24,neutral
need to be thinking about hepatitis B,70.08,5.91,75.99,neutral
vaccine and make sure that they have,72.24,5.699,77.939,neutral
vaccine on hand to give to their,75.99,5.1,81.08999999999999,sad
diabetic patients we do know from the,77.939,6.061,84.0,neutral
data that we reviewed that diabetic,81.09,4.44,85.53,neutral
patients are generally in their,84.0,3.57,87.57,neutral
physician offices quite frequently,85.53,4.949,90.479,sad
during the year at routine visits and,87.57,5.13,92.69999999999999,sad
follow-up visits for their diabetic care,90.479,4.261,94.74,neutral
so we don't think an extra visit is,92.7,4.559,97.259,neutral
going to be necessary for this and when,94.74,4.62,99.36,neutral
you're diabetic patients come in for,97.259,4.301,101.56,sad
routine checks or in the,99.36,4.48,103.84,sad
diabetes clinic or endocrinologist,101.56,5.43,106.99000000000001,sad
clinic that that's a good opportunity to,103.84,5.93,109.77000000000001,sad
consider immunizing and so,106.99,5.22,112.21,neutral
endocrinologists have a new vaccine to,109.77,4.419,114.189,neutral
consider they should already be giving,112.21,5.31,117.52,neutral
influenza vaccine do their patients but,114.189,6.421,120.61,neutral
now we've added hepatitis B vaccine is,117.52,5.519,123.039,sad
another vaccine for their particular,120.61,5.81,126.42,neutral
