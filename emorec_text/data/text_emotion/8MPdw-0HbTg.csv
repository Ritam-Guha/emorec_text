injection is an injection where that,14.849,4.951,19.8,fear
goes into the fat of the skin it's,17.25,4.59,21.84,surprise

to do is you're going to go to the,63.21,5.61,68.82000000000001,
abdomen and you'll find the umbilical,64.89,6.3,71.19,
area and you'll want to go two inches,68.82,5.88,74.69999999999999,
away from the umbilical area and ask the,71.19,5.43,76.62,fear
patient where's the last time they gave,74.7,3.93,78.63000000000001,fear
you your shot because you don't want to,76.62,4.859,81.479,fear
go in the same area she told me that,78.63,4.5,83.13,fear
they went over here last time so this,81.479,3.901,85.38,fear
time we're going to go on this side so,83.13,3.84,86.97,fear
we're about two inches away from the,85.38,4.95,90.33,fear
umbilical area what we're going to do is,86.97,5.55,92.52,
we're going to clean the area for about,90.33,3.81,94.14,
three to five seconds for the alcohol,92.52,4.26,96.78,
prep in a nice circular motion keeping,94.14,6.12,100.26,
it as clean as possible and this isn't a,96.78,5.22,102.0,
sterile procedure you can use clean,100.26,5.43,105.69,
gloves and we clean the area and then,102.0,6.869,108.869,
we're going to get our syringe going to,105.69,8.34,114.03,
take the cap off and you're sort of just,108.869,8.07,116.939,
going to pinch the fat of the skin okay,114.03,5.46,119.49,
and so just pinch that and you're going,116.939,4.711,121.64999999999999,
to go in at a ninety degree angle like,119.49,4.98,124.47,
you're throwing a dart so what we're,121.65,4.08,125.73,
going to do is we're going to go,124.47,4.98,129.45,
90 degrees no need to aspirate like how,125.73,6.12,131.85,
you do with the IM injection just going,129.45,5.7,135.14999999999998,
to give it take your needle out engage,131.85,7.61,139.46,
