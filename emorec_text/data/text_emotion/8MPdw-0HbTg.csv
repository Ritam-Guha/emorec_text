hey this is Sarah with registered nurse orange comm and today I want to show you how to give a subcu injection a subcu injection also known as a subcutaneous injection is an injection where that,5.3,24.07,29.37,sad
goes into the fat of the skin it's different than an intramuscular shot which is given in a muscle so I'm going to show you how that's done typically heparin insulin lovenox those are given,17.25,26.22,43.47,fear
in the fat of the skin today we're going to give our mannequin Miss Smith a sub-q injection of two units of regular insulin and we're going to go in the abdomen you can go in the back of the,30.45,23.7,54.15,sad
arms you can go on the fat of the legs or in the abdomen but I want to show you how to do the abdomen first what you want to do is you want to get your medicine we've already drawn up two,41.73,19.859,61.589,sad
units of insulin you want to get a subcutaneous needle these should be in your clean hole you'll want to get your gloves do hand hygiene and get your alcohol prep the end what you're going,52.079,21.271,73.35,sad
to do is you're going to go to the abdomen and you'll find the umbilical area and you'll want to go two inches away from the umbilical area and ask the patient where's the last time they gave,63.21,27.15,90.36,fear
you your shot because you don't want to go in the same area she told me that they went over here last time so this time we're going to go on this side so we're about two inches away from the,76.62,22.05,98.67,fear
umbilical area what we're going to do is we're going to clean the area for about three to five seconds for the alcohol prep in a nice circular motion keeping it as clean as possible and this isn't a,86.97,24.959999999999997,111.92999999999999,NA
sterile procedure you can use clean gloves and we clean the area and then we're going to get our syringe going to take the cap off and you're sort of just going to pinch the fat of the skin okay,100.26,34.169,134.429,NA
and so just pinch that and you're going to go in at a ninety degree angle like you're throwing a dart so what we're going to do is we're going to go 90 degrees no need to aspirate like how,116.939,24.871000000000002,141.81,NA
you do with the IM injection just going to give it take your needle out engage the safety and put it in the sharps and that is how you give a subcu injection it's so easy and so simple take some,129.45,31.709999999999997,161.16,NA
technique but after you get it down it's easy so I hope you like this video if you want to watch a video on how to start an IV how to give an IM injection I have all those so be sure to check,145.02,19.83,164.85000000000002,NA
