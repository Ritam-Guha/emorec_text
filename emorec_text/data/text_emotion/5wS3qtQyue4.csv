hey everyone so today's talking Tuesday was a request and I got a comment from a user who was asking about this condition that she has I'm gonna try to pronounce it and if I butcher it I'm sorry it is,0.03,19.35,19.380000000000003,sad
called a cam ptosis nigricans and I'm not sure I pronounced that right but what it is it's kind of like this pigmentation this darkening of the skin and it kind of appears on the body it,8.79,20.759,29.549,sad
can't happen elbows knees usually it's in the armpits or in the folds of skin some people who have a little bit more stomach flaps or things that really hang over,19.77,16.98,36.75,sad
they might get this discoloration there and it's not something that you can get off it's actually change in the skin also be found here and folds in the neck a lot of us have these natural folds and,28.41,19.531,47.941,sad
some of those and some people have larger folds than that this are here on the chin and a lot of times this condition will show up the groin and the forehead and really any of these areas,38.37,18.12,56.489999999999995,sad
that you will find some of these folds happen which is the intent of the elbow or the exterior dent of the knee now as far as treatment goes there really is nothing topical that you guys can apply,47.37,18.659,66.029,sad
to get rid of this but the main thing is to kind of treat the underlying cause what is causing it in the first place and I totally believe that for instance acne just don't just zap does it treat,56.579,21.330000000000002,77.909,sad
what's causing visit in the first place you know what I mean so that's exactly the way medical professionals treat this condition there are a couple of things that kind of onset it it can be highly,67.229,20.791,88.02,sad
genetic and in that case you just want to do some lifestyle changes just to kind of help circulate blood and really just kind of try to remove that and prevent it from getting worse there are,77.64,17.009,94.649,sad
some medications out there but you really should talk to your doctor something over-the-counter that may help is fish oil or foods they're really really high in that omega-3 there are,86.43,16.111,102.54100000000001,sad
some topical medications that have been effective but again this isn't foolproof so I'm Tetra niacin some lactaid creams have been shown to help sometimes hydroquinone which is a skin lightening,94.32,20.19,114.50999999999999,sad
agent of course with all of these do you want to make sure that you avoid sun exposure and apply sunscreen whenever you're out and about sometimes even accutane is shown and,104.49,15.059000000000001,119.54899999999999,sad
taken orally to kind of help that but again don't do this unless your doctor kind of tells you to and unless you have medical supervision sometimes contraceptives such as birth,111.75,16.291,128.041,sad
control or even things like microdermabrasion um some of these skin treatments can help but those are really for extreme cases a lot of times these kind of flare-ups can be precursors of,120.36,22.378999999999998,142.739,sad
tumors so if guys have a ton of these and they're not genetic you may want to get checked for cancer or diabetes because diabetes can also onset this people who are,131.489,18.720999999999997,150.21,sad
overweight or even if you're not overweight and have this condition you should get a cancer screen to see if there's any tumors that are altering hormone levels and things like that also,140.79,17.249000000000002,158.039,sad
increase your exercise and clean up your diet diet exercise have everything to do your body is kind of like a machine everything goes together and if one thing goes wrong everything else is,149.129,17.611,166.73999999999998,sad
gonna go wrong so if you guys exercise you can lower those insulin levels if you eat right you lower those insulin levels the lower those insulin levels are the less likely you're going to be,157.68,18.99,176.67000000000002,sad
to have these kind of outbreaks and create this pigmentation and kind of increased melanin patches in these areas of skin also the less of these folds you have you know do some exercise get rid,167.7,19.378999999999998,187.07899999999998,sad
of these folds it's not going to be as noticeable there are surgical procedures where you can take out the folds and take out the color but again that's in very extreme cases and I really,177.299,17.311,194.61,sad
recommend diet and exercise just to kind of help clean that up a lot of people who are insulin resistant or who have diabetes will have this condition so if that's you keep on taking your,185.94,18.838,204.778,sad
medication and then really really really try to just lower those insulin levels naturally do that by eating small meals throughout the day snacks all day long don't eat meals eat things that are low,194.879,20.042,214.921,sad
on the glycemic index scale and really really really get your exercise up now also increased blood flow which will increase blood flow to the top of the skin and really help break down all that,205.29,18.209,223.499,sad
stuff I personally think that with diet exercise maybe a little bit of hydroquinone to lighten that up or even lemon juice and then lots of sunscreen that mild cases of this can be treatable,214.139,21.15,235.28900000000002,sad
but of course please talk to your doctor first and really see what options are best for you so I hope this kind of helps you guys I don't currently have this condition I hope I never get it but,225.0,17.581,242.581,sad
it can be genetic or people can develop it over time so if you guys have it if you know someone that has it or if you've been if you've never heard of it and just are wondering about it well if,233.94,14.55,248.49,sad

this it helps you a little bit I'm try that fish oil try some more exercise and you know what five minutes of walking is better and you know even if you slip up to step,257.039,18.901,275.94,sad
