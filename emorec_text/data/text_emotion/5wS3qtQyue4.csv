hey everyone so today's talking Tuesday,0.03,3.48,3.51,neutral
was a request and I got a comment from a,1.74,3.36,5.1,neutral
user who was asking about this condition,3.51,3.3,6.81,neutral
that she has I'm gonna try to pronounce,5.1,3.69,8.79,neutral
it and if I butcher it I'm sorry it is,6.81,5.52,12.329999999999998,neutral
called a cam ptosis nigricans and I'm,8.79,5.28,14.07,neutral
not sure I pronounced that right but,12.33,3.24,15.57,fear
what it is it's kind of like this,14.07,3.78,17.85,neutral
pigmentation this darkening of the skin,15.57,4.2,19.77,neutral
and it kind of appears on the body it,17.85,4.259,22.109,neutral
can't happen elbows knees usually it's,19.77,4.339,24.109,neutral
in the armpits or in the folds of skin,22.109,3.901,26.01,neutral
some people who have a little bit more,24.109,3.851,27.96,neutral
stomach flaps or things that really hang,26.01,2.4,28.41,neutral
over,27.96,2.489,30.449,neutral
they might get this discoloration there,28.41,3.809,32.219,neutral
and it's not something that you can get,30.449,3.54,33.989000000000004,neutral
off it's actually change in the skin,32.219,3.84,36.059,neutral
also be found here and folds in the neck,33.989,4.381,38.37,neutral
a lot of us have these natural folds and,36.059,3.961,40.019999999999996,neutral
some of those and some people have,38.37,3.029,41.399,neutral
larger folds than that this are here on,40.02,3.18,43.2,neutral
the chin and a lot of times this,41.399,4.051,45.45,neutral
condition will show up the groin and the,43.2,4.17,47.370000000000005,neutral
forehead and really any of these areas,45.45,3.69,49.14,neutral
that you will find some of these folds,47.37,3.24,50.61,neutral
happen which is the intent of the elbow,49.14,4.2,53.34,neutral
or the exterior dent of the knee now as,50.61,4.379,54.989,neutral
far as treatment goes there really is,53.34,3.239,56.579,neutral
nothing topical that you guys can apply,54.989,3.601,58.589999999999996,neutral
to get rid of this but the main thing is,56.579,4.261,60.84,neutral
to kind of treat the underlying cause,58.59,4.199,62.789,neutral
what is causing it in the first place,60.84,3.87,64.71000000000001,neutral
and I totally believe that for instance,62.789,4.44,67.229,neutral
acne just don't just zap does it treat,64.71,4.56,69.27,neutral
what's causing visit in the first place,67.229,4.171,71.4,neutral
you know what I mean so that's exactly,69.27,4.83,74.1,neutral
the way medical professionals treat this,71.4,4.23,75.63000000000001,neutral
condition there are a couple of things,74.1,3.54,77.64,neutral
that kind of onset it it can be highly,75.63,4.02,79.64999999999999,neutral
genetic and in that case you just want,77.64,3.99,81.63,neutral
to do some lifestyle changes just to,79.65,3.84,83.49000000000001,neutral
kind of help circulate blood and really,81.63,3.3,84.92999999999999,neutral
just kind of try to remove that and,83.49,2.94,86.42999999999999,neutral
prevent it from getting worse there are,84.93,2.939,87.869,neutral
some medications out there but you,86.43,2.43,88.86000000000001,neutral
really should talk to your doctor,87.869,2.671,90.54,neutral
something over-the-counter that may help,88.86,3.6,92.46,neutral
is fish oil or foods they're really,90.54,3.78,94.32000000000001,neutral
really high in that omega-3 there are,92.46,3.63,96.08999999999999,neutral
some topical medications that have been,94.32,3.99,98.30999999999999,neutral
effective but again this isn't foolproof,96.09,5.04,101.13000000000001,neutral
so I'm Tetra niacin some lactaid creams,98.31,4.349,102.659,neutral
have been shown to help sometimes,101.13,3.36,104.49,fear
hydroquinone which is a skin lightening,102.659,3.451,106.11,fear
agent of course with all of these do you,104.49,2.909,107.399,fear
want to make sure that you avoid sun,106.11,3.0,109.11,neutral
exposure and apply sunscreen whenever,107.399,2.4,109.799,neutral
you're out and about,109.11,2.64,111.75,neutral
sometimes even accutane is shown and,109.799,4.11,113.909,neutral
taken orally to kind of help that but,111.75,4.35,116.1,neutral
again don't do this unless your doctor,113.909,3.57,117.479,neutral
kind of tells you to and unless you have,116.1,2.339,118.439,neutral
medical supervision,117.479,2.881,120.36,neutral
sometimes contraceptives such as birth,118.439,3.151,121.58999999999999,neutral
control or even things like,120.36,3.359,123.719,neutral
microdermabrasion um some of these skin,121.59,4.529,126.119,neutral
treatments can help but those are really,123.719,5.07,128.789,neutral
for extreme cases a lot of times these,126.119,5.37,131.489,neutral
kind of flare-ups can be precursors of,128.789,4.051,132.83999999999997,neutral
tumors so if,131.489,3.661,135.15,neutral
guys have a ton of these and they're not,132.84,3.75,136.59,neutral
genetic you may want to get checked for,135.15,3.69,138.84,neutral
cancer or diabetes because diabetes can,136.59,4.2,140.79,neutral
also onset this people who are,138.84,3.42,142.26,fear
overweight or even if you're not,140.79,3.12,143.91,neutral
overweight and have this condition you,142.26,3.18,145.44,neutral
should get a cancer screen to see if,143.91,2.969,146.879,neutral
there's any tumors that are altering,145.44,3.689,149.129,neutral
hormone levels and things like that also,146.879,4.291,151.17,neutral
increase your exercise and clean up your,149.129,4.411,153.54,neutral
diet diet exercise have everything to do,151.17,3.929,155.099,neutral
your body is kind of like a machine,153.54,2.91,156.45,neutral
everything goes together and if one,155.099,2.581,157.67999999999998,neutral
thing goes wrong everything else is,156.45,3.78,160.23,neutral
gonna go wrong so if you guys exercise,157.68,4.71,162.39000000000001,neutral
you can lower those insulin levels if,160.23,3.78,164.01,neutral
you eat right you lower those insulin,162.39,3.42,165.80999999999997,neutral
levels the lower those insulin levels,164.01,3.69,167.7,neutral
are the less likely you're going to be,165.81,3.39,169.2,neutral
to have these kind of outbreaks and,167.7,3.78,171.48,neutral
create this pigmentation and kind of,169.2,4.17,173.36999999999998,neutral
increased melanin patches in these areas,171.48,3.93,175.41,neutral
of skin also the less of these folds you,173.37,3.929,177.299,neutral
have you know do some exercise get rid,175.41,3.57,178.98,neutral
of these folds it's not going to be as,177.299,3.541,180.84,neutral
noticeable there are surgical procedures,178.98,3.33,182.31,neutral
where you can take out the folds and,180.84,3.239,184.079,neutral
take out the color but again that's in,182.31,3.63,185.94,neutral
very extreme cases and I really,184.079,3.571,187.65,neutral
recommend diet and exercise just to kind,185.94,3.21,189.15,neutral
of help clean that up a lot of people,187.65,3.419,191.06900000000002,neutral
who are insulin resistant or who have,189.15,4.08,193.23000000000002,neutral
diabetes will have this condition so if,191.069,3.81,194.879,neutral
that's you keep on taking your,193.23,4.319,197.54899999999998,neutral
medication and then really really really,194.879,4.471,199.35,neutral
try to just lower those insulin levels,197.549,3.541,201.09,neutral
naturally do that by eating small meals,199.35,3.66,203.01,neutral
throughout the day snacks all day long,201.09,4.2,205.29,neutral
don't eat meals eat things that are low,203.01,4.17,207.17999999999998,neutral
on the glycemic index scale and really,205.29,3.69,208.98,neutral
really really get your exercise up now,207.18,3.51,210.69,neutral
also increased blood flow which will,208.98,3.119,212.099,neutral
increase blood flow to the top of the,210.69,3.449,214.139,neutral
skin and really help break down all that,212.099,4.441,216.54,neutral
stuff I personally think that with diet,214.139,4.801,218.94,neutral
exercise maybe a little bit of,216.54,4.08,220.62,neutral
hydroquinone to lighten that up or even,218.94,3.54,222.48,fear
lemon juice and then lots of sunscreen,220.62,4.38,225.0,neutral
that mild cases of this can be treatable,222.48,4.349,226.82899999999998,neutral
but of course please talk to your doctor,225.0,3.239,228.239,neutral
first and really see what options are,226.829,3.27,230.09900000000002,neutral
best for you so I hope this kind of,228.239,3.391,231.63,neutral
helps you guys I don't currently have,230.099,3.841,233.94,neutral
this condition I hope I never get it but,231.63,3.84,235.47,neutral
it can be genetic or people can develop,233.94,3.51,237.45,neutral
it over time so if you guys have it if,235.47,3.419,238.889,neutral
you know someone that has it or if,237.45,2.7,240.14999999999998,neutral

and just are wondering about it well if,240.15,2.25,242.4,neutral
you never heard it you wouldn't be,241.56,2.1,243.66,neutral
