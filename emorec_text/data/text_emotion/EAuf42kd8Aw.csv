"So lots of people see this picture of me and
the first thing that they assume is that I bleached my skin and that is 100% NOT true.
So I wanna talk to you guys about something that is a side-effect of my weight gain and
weight loss and something that has been presented to me on both social media um, as well as
through e-mail and just questions about my skin and about the changes that I've seen
since losing weight. So when I first started",0.299,30.62,30.919,sad
"experiencing the side-effects of what I now
know is Acanthosis Nigricans, I did not know what it was. I had dark, leathery patches
around my eyes, um, on my cheek bones, on my neck, on my elbows, my knees, even my knuckles.
And I had no idea what it was, the main thing that I wanted to do was to fix the obvious

me. So I tried everything, I tried creams,",30.919,31.591,62.510000000000005,sad
"I tried changing my face wash, I tried facial
scrubs, um I tried dark spot removers, I tried EVERYTHING! So I finally went to see a dermatologist
and when I did, um, they told me or she told me that she thought that it was Acanthosis
Nigricans and she suggested that I go to an...go and see my normal doctor or my primary care
physician, um, to be tested for other, you know, other diseases. Um, and so once I got
to my doctor I actually found out that I was",62.51,35.07,97.58,sad
"in fact pre-diabetic. And that the Acanthosis
Nigricans was a direct um, symptom of that. And so I do encourage anybody who is experiencing
those types of um, discoloration or differences in your skin...Pay attention because it could
be a sign of something more serious. For me, um, luckily once I did start to lose the weight,
the discoloration started to fade and my skin started to become normal again. Uh, I wanna
point out that before I gained weight, I wasn't",97.58,32.77,130.35,sad
"this color. So it was an obvious effect of
the weight gain. It was not something where I bleached my skin or anything like that to
change my color. I started off this color, I turned that color and now I'm back to my
normal color. So I hope that this clears up all of the uh comments and things that I've
been getting on Instagram. And I strongly, strongly suggest that if you are experiencing
any type of skin issues - you should go and",130.35,27.05,157.4,sad
"see your doctor because you never know what
your body is trying to tell you. Luckily, I never did get to the full-blown stage of
diabetes. I was able to prevent it with the weight loss so again, if you're having any
of those types of, you know, reactions in your skin or you're seeing changes - don't
ignore it! Your body is probably trying to tell you something. So thank you guys so much
for watching and I will see you next week.",157.4,24.85,182.25,sad
