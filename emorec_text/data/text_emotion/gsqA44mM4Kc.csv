podiatrists and today we're here to,5.629,4.211,9.84,fear
discuss the do's and don'ts of diabetic,7.649,4.2,11.849,fear
foot care we're gonna focus on three,9.84,4.29,14.129999999999999,surprise
major areas which is diabetics and their,11.849,5.01,16.859,surprise
skin diabetics and their feeling and,14.13,4.8,18.93,surprise
diabetics following injuries and how,16.859,3.42,20.279000000000003,surprise
they should follow up with that,18.93,4.95,23.88,surprise
so overall diabetics often have problems,20.279,5.371,25.65,
with nail discoloration or nail,23.88,4.26,28.14,happy
loosening or thickening as well as,25.65,4.889,30.538999999999998,fear
severely dry skin so I often tell,28.14,3.869,32.009,fear
patients when they see any of those,30.539,2.761,33.300000000000004,fear
problems they should come in see a,32.009,2.851,34.86,angry
podiatrist sooner than later so you can,33.3,3.63,36.93,fear
diagnose what's going on I always,34.86,4.109,38.969,fear
recommend patients to lotion their feet,36.93,4.68,41.61,
often make sure it really dries in and,38.969,4.441,43.410000000000004,
make sure the dilution is not in between,41.61,3.269,44.879,
their toes because that can cause,43.41,4.35,47.76,fear
maceration the second thing that happens,44.879,4.921,49.8,fear
is diabetics sometimes to get what is,47.76,3.959,51.719,fear
called diabetic neuropathy where they,49.8,4.11,53.91,
experience numbness and tingling in,51.719,4.5,56.219,
their toes that may go up their foot and,53.91,5.309,59.218999999999994,fear
ankle or they may have a general pain or,56.219,6.0,62.219,fear
burning in their foot and ankle so I,59.219,4.561,63.78,fear
think all patients when they have those,62.219,3.001,65.22,fear
symptoms that should come in see a,63.78,3.54,67.32000000000001,happy
podiatrist once more so we can actually,65.22,4.56,69.78,happy
diagnose what's going on and medications,67.32,5.1,72.41999999999999,fear
that we can prescribe to them because of,69.78,4.68,74.46000000000001,fear
that patients are often told not to go,72.42,5.07,77.49000000000001,fear
barefoot that's the first do do not go,74.46,5.46,79.91999999999999,fear
barefoot barefoot includes soft soled,77.49,5.129,82.619,fear
shoes socks as well as actually being,79.92,5.1,85.02,surprise
barefoot and the reason is that patients,82.619,4.201,86.82,fear
do have diabetic neuropathy may lose,85.02,3.87,88.89,fear
their protective sensations and they may,86.82,6.63,93.44999999999999,fear
get a cut or scratch or a nail inside,88.89,6.33,95.22,fear
their shoe that they don't know even a,93.45,3.39,96.84,fear
bottle cap I've had patients has come in,95.22,3.3,98.52,fear
with a bottle cap and their foot and,96.84,4.139,100.979,fear
they didn't know was there so it's a,98.52,3.75,102.27,fear
first line of protection for those,100.979,3.21,104.189,fear
patients don't go barefoot swear,102.27,2.94,105.21,surprise
supportive shoes,104.189,5.011,109.19999999999999,happy
the second thing goes into patients not,105.21,6.089,111.29899999999999,
soaking their feet that's often a common,109.2,2.44,111.64,
myth,111.299,2.291,113.59,fear
section where patients at the end of the,111.64,3.87,115.51,fear
day they want to soak their feet for a,113.59,4.08,117.67,fear
long period of time and the reason being,115.51,3.99,119.5,fear
is that you can soak it too long and,117.67,4.17,121.84,fear
actually cause a softening of your skin,119.5,4.38,123.88,fear
or you may not be able to gauge the,121.84,4.68,126.52000000000001,fear
temperature then actually this so what I,123.88,4.08,127.96,fear
tell patients is that when they're,126.52,3.39,129.91,fear
taking a shower they should stop up the,127.96,4.32,132.28,fear
water and just stand in the water for,129.91,3.84,133.75,fear
some time while they're bathing and,132.28,3.81,136.09,fear
prior to that this uses their hand or,133.75,4.41,138.16,fear
their elbow to gauge the temperature of,136.09,4.32,140.41,fear
the water so that they're not at risk of,138.16,4.68,142.84,fear
developing a burn to their feet or even,140.41,4.53,144.94,fear
a cold injury because that often happens,142.84,4.26,147.1,fear
as well the other thing they would like,144.94,3.93,148.87,fear
to go over is diabetics and injuries,147.1,3.33,150.43,fear
diabetics are just like us they're,148.87,3.39,152.26,fear
active patients and sometimes against,150.43,4.02,154.45000000000002,fear
sprains or they twist your ankle or they,152.26,4.02,156.28,fear
drop something heavy on their foot and,154.45,3.63,158.07999999999998,fear
they may not know that they actually,156.28,3.929,160.209,fear
have a worse injury than what they think,158.08,4.65,162.73000000000002,fear
it is so I tell my diabetic patients if,160.209,4.231,164.44,fear
something like that ever happens call up,162.73,3.45,166.17999999999998,fear
your podiatrist let them know it happens,164.44,4.019,168.459,fear
and they should see within 24 to 48,166.18,4.95,171.13,fear
hours and if it's a major injury like a,168.459,5.761,174.22,fear
laceration or a real fracture of course,171.13,5.1,176.23,surprise
go and see your emergency department so,174.22,4.62,178.84,
that they can take care of that diabetic,176.23,4.229,180.459,fear
patient should also look at their feet,178.84,4.5,183.34,fear
on a regular basis so the best time to,180.459,4.141,184.6,fear
do that is after you get out of the,183.34,3.69,187.03,
shower here we have a magnifying glass,184.6,5.07,189.67,
which extends like this you can purchase,187.03,5.16,192.19,fear
this from any drugstore and she can,189.67,4.289,193.95899999999997,fear
demonstrate how easy it is to look at,192.19,3.78,195.97,
the bottom of your feet this should be,193.959,3.901,197.86,
part of your daily routine just like,195.97,3.75,199.72,
brushing your teeth should keep it in,197.86,3.719,201.579,
your medicine cabinets after you have,199.72,4.38,204.1,fear
the shower dry your feet thoroughly dry,201.579,4.41,205.989,fear
it in between your toes and look at your,204.1,4.35,208.45,fear
feets really well and the importance of,205.989,4.47,210.459,
that is that if you do have a cut or a,208.45,4.5,212.95,
scrape or blister or anything that looks,210.459,5.641,216.1,
abnormal you can see it first and call,212.95,4.68,217.63,
your local podiatrist to come and get it,216.1,3.66,219.76,fear
checked out so two take-home message,217.63,3.99,221.62,fear
that anything that looks suspicious,219.76,3.15,222.91,fear
in terms of the health of your feet,221.62,4.17,225.79,surprise
should be evaluated by a podiatrist as,222.91,4.02,226.93,surprise
