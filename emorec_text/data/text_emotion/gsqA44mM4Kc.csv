podiatrists and today we're here to,5.629,4.211,9.84,sad
discuss the do's and don'ts of diabetic,7.649,4.2,11.849,sad
foot care we're gonna focus on three,9.84,4.29,14.129999999999999,sad
major areas which is diabetics and their,11.849,5.01,16.859,sad
skin diabetics and their feeling and,14.13,4.8,18.93,sad
diabetics following injuries and how,16.859,3.42,20.279000000000003,sad
they should follow up with that,18.93,4.95,23.88,surprise
so overall diabetics often have problems,20.279,5.371,25.65,NA
with nail discoloration or nail,23.88,4.26,28.14,neutral
loosening or thickening as well as,25.65,4.889,30.538999999999998,neutral
severely dry skin so I often tell,28.14,3.869,32.009,neutral
patients when they see any of those,30.539,2.761,33.300000000000004,fear
problems they should come in see a,32.009,2.851,34.86,angry
podiatrist sooner than later so you can,33.3,3.63,36.93,neutral
diagnose what's going on I always,34.86,4.109,38.969,neutral
recommend patients to lotion their feet,36.93,4.68,41.61,neutral
often make sure it really dries in and,38.969,4.441,43.410000000000004,sad
make sure the dilution is not in between,41.61,3.269,44.879,sad
their toes because that can cause,43.41,4.35,47.76,sad
maceration the second thing that happens,44.879,4.921,49.8,sad
is diabetics sometimes to get what is,47.76,3.959,51.719,sad
called diabetic neuropathy where they,49.8,4.11,53.91,neutral
experience numbness and tingling in,51.719,4.5,56.219,neutral
their toes that may go up their foot and,53.91,5.309,59.218999999999994,neutral
ankle or they may have a general pain or,56.219,6.0,62.219,fear
burning in their foot and ankle so I,59.219,4.561,63.78,fear
think all patients when they have those,62.219,3.001,65.22,neutral
symptoms that should come in see a,63.78,3.54,67.32000000000001,neutral
podiatrist once more so we can actually,65.22,4.56,69.78,neutral
diagnose what's going on and medications,67.32,5.1,72.41999999999999,fear
that we can prescribe to them because of,69.78,4.68,74.46000000000001,neutral
that patients are often told not to go,72.42,5.07,77.49000000000001,neutral
barefoot that's the first do do not go,74.46,5.46,79.91999999999999,neutral
barefoot barefoot includes soft soled,77.49,5.129,82.619,neutral
shoes socks as well as actually being,79.92,5.1,85.02,neutral
barefoot and the reason is that patients,82.619,4.201,86.82,neutral
do have diabetic neuropathy may lose,85.02,3.87,88.89,fear
their protective sensations and they may,86.82,6.63,93.44999999999999,neutral
get a cut or scratch or a nail inside,88.89,6.33,95.22,neutral
their shoe that they don't know even a,93.45,3.39,96.84,neutral
bottle cap I've had patients has come in,95.22,3.3,98.52,neutral
with a bottle cap and their foot and,96.84,4.139,100.979,sad
they didn't know was there so it's a,98.52,3.75,102.27,fear
first line of protection for those,100.979,3.21,104.189,fear
patients don't go barefoot swear,102.27,2.94,105.21,sad
supportive shoes,104.189,5.011,109.19999999999999,neutral
the second thing goes into patients not,105.21,6.089,111.29899999999999,neutral
soaking their feet that's often a common,109.2,2.44,111.64,sad
myth,111.299,2.291,113.59,sad
section where patients at the end of the,111.64,3.87,115.51,neutral
day they want to soak their feet for a,113.59,4.08,117.67,neutral
long period of time and the reason being,115.51,3.99,119.5,neutral
is that you can soak it too long and,117.67,4.17,121.84,neutral
actually cause a softening of your skin,119.5,4.38,123.88,neutral
or you may not be able to gauge the,121.84,4.68,126.52000000000001,neutral
temperature then actually this so what I,123.88,4.08,127.96,neutral
tell patients is that when they're,126.52,3.39,129.91,neutral
taking a shower they should stop up the,127.96,4.32,132.28,neutral
water and just stand in the water for,129.91,3.84,133.75,sad
some time while they're bathing and,132.28,3.81,136.09,sad
prior to that this uses their hand or,133.75,4.41,138.16,neutral
their elbow to gauge the temperature of,136.09,4.32,140.41,neutral
the water so that they're not at risk of,138.16,4.68,142.84,sad
developing a burn to their feet or even,140.41,4.53,144.94,sad
a cold injury because that often happens,142.84,4.26,147.1,sad
as well the other thing they would like,144.94,3.93,148.87,sad
to go over is diabetics and injuries,147.1,3.33,150.43,neutral
diabetics are just like us they're,148.87,3.39,152.26,neutral
active patients and sometimes against,150.43,4.02,154.45000000000002,neutral
sprains or they twist your ankle or they,152.26,4.02,156.28,neutral
drop something heavy on their foot and,154.45,3.63,158.07999999999998,neutral
they may not know that they actually,156.28,3.929,160.209,neutral
have a worse injury than what they think,158.08,4.65,162.73000000000002,sad
it is so I tell my diabetic patients if,160.209,4.231,164.44,sad
something like that ever happens call up,162.73,3.45,166.17999999999998,sad
your podiatrist let them know it happens,164.44,4.019,168.459,sad
and they should see within 24 to 48,166.18,4.95,171.13,sad
hours and if it's a major injury like a,168.459,5.761,174.22,fear
laceration or a real fracture of course,171.13,5.1,176.23,neutral
go and see your emergency department so,174.22,4.62,178.84,neutral
that they can take care of that diabetic,176.23,4.229,180.459,neutral
patient should also look at their feet,178.84,4.5,183.34,neutral
on a regular basis so the best time to,180.459,4.141,184.6,neutral
do that is after you get out of the,183.34,3.69,187.03,neutral
shower here we have a magnifying glass,184.6,5.07,189.67,neutral
which extends like this you can purchase,187.03,5.16,192.19,neutral
this from any drugstore and she can,189.67,4.289,193.95899999999997,sad
demonstrate how easy it is to look at,192.19,3.78,195.97,NA
the bottom of your feet this should be,193.959,3.901,197.86,NA
part of your daily routine just like,195.97,3.75,199.72,sad
brushing your teeth should keep it in,197.86,3.719,201.579,sad
your medicine cabinets after you have,199.72,4.38,204.1,fear
the shower dry your feet thoroughly dry,201.579,4.41,205.989,fear
it in between your toes and look at your,204.1,4.35,208.45,neutral
feets really well and the importance of,205.989,4.47,210.459,neutral
that is that if you do have a cut or a,208.45,4.5,212.95,sad
scrape or blister or anything that looks,210.459,5.641,216.1,neutral
abnormal you can see it first and call,212.95,4.68,217.63,neutral
your local podiatrist to come and get it,216.1,3.66,219.76,fear
checked out so two take-home message,217.63,3.99,221.62,fear
that anything that looks suspicious,219.76,3.15,222.91,fear
in terms of the health of your feet,221.62,4.17,225.79,neutral
should be evaluated by a podiatrist as,222.91,4.02,226.93,neutral
soon as possible,225.79,3.69,229.48,neutral
don't treat any pain yourself it's,226.93,4.32,231.25,neutral
always best to have a doctor that treats,229.48,4.14,233.61999999999998,neutral
