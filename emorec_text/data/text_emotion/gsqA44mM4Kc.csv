podiatrists and today we're here to discuss the do's and don'ts of diabetic foot care we're gonna focus on three major areas which is diabetics and their skin diabetics and their feeling and,5.629,22.511,28.14,angry
diabetics following injuries and how they should follow up with that so overall diabetics often have problems with nail discoloration or nail loosening or thickening as well as,16.859,22.89,39.749,angry
severely dry skin so I often tell patients when they see any of those problems they should come in see a podiatrist sooner than later so you can diagnose what's going on I always,28.14,17.22,45.36,angry
recommend patients to lotion their feet often make sure it really dries in and make sure the dilution is not in between their toes because that can cause maceration the second thing that happens,36.93,21.660999999999998,58.590999999999994,angry
is diabetics sometimes to get what is called diabetic neuropathy where they experience numbness and tingling in their toes that may go up their foot and ankle or they may have a general pain or,47.76,23.878,71.638,angry
burning in their foot and ankle so I think all patients when they have those symptoms that should come in see a podiatrist once more so we can actually diagnose what's going on and medications,59.219,20.762,79.981,angry
that we can prescribe to them because of that patients are often told not to go barefoot that's the first do do not go barefoot barefoot includes soft soled shoes socks as well as actually being,69.78,25.439,95.219,angry
barefoot and the reason is that patients do have diabetic neuropathy may lose their protective sensations and they may get a cut or scratch or a nail inside their shoe that they don't know even a,82.619,24.421,107.03999999999999,angry
bottle cap I've had patients has come in with a bottle cap and their foot and they didn't know was there so it's a first line of protection for those patients don't go barefoot swear,95.22,17.339000000000002,112.559,angry
supportive shoes the second thing goes into patients not soaking their feet that's often a common myth section where patients at the end of the,104.189,19.701,123.88999999999999,angry
day they want to soak their feet for a long period of time and the reason being is that you can soak it too long and actually cause a softening of your skin or you may not be able to gauge the,113.59,21.3,134.89000000000001,angry
temperature then actually this so what I tell patients is that when they're taking a shower they should stop up the water and just stand in the water for some time while they're bathing and,123.88,19.44,143.32,angry
prior to that this uses their hand or their elbow to gauge the temperature of the water so that they're not at risk of developing a burn to their feet or even a cold injury because that often happens,133.75,22.200000000000003,155.95,angry
as well the other thing they would like to go over is diabetics and injuries diabetics are just like us they're active patients and sometimes against sprains or they twist your ankle or they,144.94,18.689999999999998,163.63,angry
drop something heavy on their foot and they may not know that they actually have a worse injury than what they think it is so I tell my diabetic patients if something like that ever happens call up,154.45,19.889999999999997,174.33999999999997,angry
your podiatrist let them know it happens and they should see within 24 to 48 hours and if it's a major injury like a laceration or a real fracture of course go and see your emergency department so,164.44,24.45,188.89,angry
that they can take care of that diabetic patient should also look at their feet on a regular basis so the best time to do that is after you get out of the shower here we have a magnifying glass,176.23,21.63,197.85999999999999,angry
which extends like this you can purchase this from any drugstore and she can demonstrate how easy it is to look at the bottom of your feet this should be part of your daily routine just like,187.03,20.88,207.91,angry
brushing your teeth should keep it in your medicine cabinets after you have the shower dry your feet thoroughly dry it in between your toes and look at your feets really well and the importance of,197.86,21.329,219.18900000000002,angry
that is that if you do have a cut or a scrape or blister or anything that looks abnormal you can see it first and call your local podiatrist to come and get it checked out so two take-home message,208.45,22.471000000000004,230.921,angry
that anything that looks suspicious in terms of the health of your feet should be evaluated by a podiatrist as soon as possible don't treat any pain yourself it's,219.76,19.35,239.10999999999999,angry
always best to have a doctor that treats it so those are my tips and pearls for diabetics your feet once again I'm dr. Judy America I'm a podiatrist at Kennedy,229.48,20.17,249.64999999999998,angry
