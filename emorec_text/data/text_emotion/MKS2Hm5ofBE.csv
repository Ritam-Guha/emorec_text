hi guys someone recently had a question,0.0,5.22,5.22,neutral
about proton pump inhibitors PPIs okay,1.949,5.461,7.41,neutral
so first of all I want to just give you,5.22,3.839,9.059,neutral
a little disclaimer if you're on this,7.41,4.2,11.61,neutral
medication check with your doctor before,9.059,5.341,14.399999999999999,fear
coming off of it okay this is just meant,11.61,6.99,18.6,fear
for education all right this these PP,14.4,7.5,21.9,neutral
eyes are basically real powerful anti,18.6,5.88,24.48,neutral
acids and they get rid of acid in the,21.9,5.4,27.299999999999997,neutral
stomach for conditions like acid reflux,24.48,7.59,32.07,neutral
GERD gastritis ulcers those types of,27.3,6.54,33.84,neutral
things this medication is the most,32.07,4.5,36.57,NA
potent inhibitor of acid production it,33.84,5.19,39.03,neutral
can reduce stomach acid by 99 percent,36.57,4.2,40.77,neutral
that's incredible it's one of the most,39.03,5.43,44.46,neutral
widely sold drugs in the world so,40.77,5.73,46.5,neutral
obviously a lot of people have stomach,44.46,4.669,49.129,neutral
problems so it blocks the pump that,46.5,6.0,52.5,neutral
releases hydrochloric acid but it comes,49.129,5.291,54.42,neutral
with a package there's some slight minor,52.5,3.69,56.19,NA
complications when you remove stomach,54.42,6.029,60.449,neutral
acid headache nausea and that's probably,56.19,6.119,62.309,neutral
because there's a relationship between,60.449,4.17,64.619,neutral
the stomach acid and the release of bile,62.309,4.471,66.78,NA
and so if the bile is backing up from,64.619,3.661,68.28,neutral
the gallbladder you're going to feel,66.78,3.24,70.02,neutral
nauseous diarrhea,68.28,3.449,71.729,neutral
probably because you're not getting the,70.02,4.5,74.52,neutral
full digestion and things are undigested,71.729,3.78,75.509,neutral
it's going to go through your body,74.52,3.63,78.14999999999999,NA
abdominal pain and gas these two,75.509,4.711,80.22,NA
symptoms are merely the inability to,78.15,4.35,82.5,NA
digest protein you need a real strong,80.22,4.95,85.17,NA
asset to break down protein undigested,82.5,5.34,87.84,NA
protein will give you gas and abdominal,85.17,3.05,88.22,NA
pain,87.84,2.55,90.39,NA
anxiety because you're not able to break,88.22,4.359,92.579,NA
down the proteins into the amino acids,90.39,4.589,94.979,NA
which turn into the neurotransmitters,92.579,5.761,98.33999999999999,neutral
like serotonin dopamine GABA that,94.979,6.631,101.61,neutral
actually elevate your mood dizziness,98.34,5.76,104.10000000000001,NA
fatigue of course if you're not able to,101.61,4.2,105.81,fear
absorb b12 you're going to get tired,104.1,4.799,108.899,neutral
bone fractures why because you need an,105.81,5.82,111.63,neutral
acidic stomach to absorb calcium and,108.899,6.36,115.259,neutral
other minerals and protein and collagen,111.63,7.169,118.79899999999999,NA
also helps build bone muscle damage,115.259,5.941,121.2,NA
again you're not going to be able to get,118.799,5.221,124.02000000000001,NA
the full breakdown of the macronutrients,121.2,6.3,127.5,NA
in to the micronutrients amino acids,124.02,6.18,130.2,NA
being one of those increased risk,127.5,6.06,133.56,NA
dementia kitten disease c-diff which,130.2,5.28,135.48,NA
a bacterial infection in your digestive,133.56,4.59,138.15,neutral
system which usually comes after taking,135.48,5.04,140.51999999999998,neutral
antibiotics but it can also come from,138.15,5.28,143.43,neutral
taking and a powerful anti acid small,140.52,4.95,145.47,neutral
intestine bacterial overgrowth and,143.43,5.779,149.209,neutral
fungus and Candida because you need that,145.47,6.42,151.89,NA
acidifier to kill off the unfriendly,149.209,4.481,153.69,neutral
microbes so if you don't have that,151.89,3.24,155.13,neutral
you're going to get an overgrowth of the,153.69,5.46,159.15,neutral
unfriendly bacteria if you don't have,155.13,6.15,161.28,NA
enough stomach acid and you go to a,159.15,3.9,163.05,neutral
restaurant where they have raw fish for,161.28,3.84,165.12,neutral
example like a sushi restaurant and,163.05,3.84,166.89000000000001,NA
there's a lot of microbes in that fish,165.12,4.35,169.47,neutral
that normally should be killed by the,166.89,4.26,171.14999999999998,neutral
stomach acid so if you don't have that,169.47,3.96,173.43,neutral
in there the chances of you getting an,171.15,4.919,176.06900000000002,neutral
infection lower in the GI tract is very,173.43,5.61,179.04000000000002,neutral
high so that's not good,176.069,5.821,181.89,neutral
increased risk of polyps colitis which,179.04,4.86,183.9,NA
is inflammation of the colon and another,181.89,4.11,186.0,NA
condition called hypochloride Rio which,183.9,4.26,188.16,NA
is low of stomach acids which will give,186.0,5.22,191.22,NA
you an e mia decrease b12 which again a,188.16,4.74,192.9,NA
whole series of additional symptoms just,191.22,3.96,195.18,NA
with that decrease absorption of vitamin,192.9,6.929,199.829,NA
C B and K increased risk of infections,195.18,6.39,201.57,NA
we talked about that overgrowth of,199.829,4.951,204.78,NA
bacteria and increase risk of carcinoma,201.57,4.889,206.459,NA
in your stomach that's cancer in your,204.78,4.049,208.829,NA
stomach which kind of poses this whole,206.459,4.711,211.17000000000002,neutral
push that you see on the internet a lot,208.829,3.75,212.579,neutral
of people are going oh yeah you need to,211.17,3.21,214.38,neutral
alkalize you're gonna get cancer because,212.579,3.901,216.48000000000002,neutral
cancer only lives in an acidic,214.38,4.919,219.299,neutral
environment really well it also can live,216.48,4.2,220.67999999999998,neutral
in an alkaline environment as well,219.299,3.151,222.45000000000002,NA
especially in your stomach what I'm,220.68,3.839,224.519,neutral
gonna recommend for a solution and I'll,222.45,4.05,226.5,neutral
put some videos down below of previous,224.519,4.261,228.78,neutral
videos that I've done for stomach acids,226.5,4.38,230.88,neutral
but simply start taking apple cider,228.78,4.709,233.489,neutral
vinegar you put two tablespoons in a,230.88,4.639,235.519,neutral
glass of water drink it with a straw,233.489,5.071,238.56,neutral
maybe put some stevia in there to make,235.519,4.84,240.359,neutral
it taste a little bit better and do that,238.56,4.799,243.359,neutral
with each meal that's a mild handling,240.359,5.311,245.67000000000002,neutral
you can also increase your stomach acid,243.359,4.261,247.62,neutral
by also taking something called patan√®,245.67,4.649,250.319,neutral
hydrochloride which is an acidifier it's,247.62,5.01,252.63,neutral
natural there's no side effects now the,250.319,3.901,254.22,neutral
only time you wouldn't want to use as,252.63,4.44,257.07,neutral
certifiers is if you had an ulcer in,254.22,5.85,260.07,neutral
which case you'd want to consume leafy,257.07,5.76,262.83,neutral
greens chlorophyll things to heal the,260.07,5.92,265.99,neutral
ulcer first but the ultimate solution,262.83,6.04,268.87,neutral
to resolving acid reflux GERD is just to,265.99,6.269,272.259,neutral
get the eating corrected to start eating,268.87,6.06,274.93,neutral
