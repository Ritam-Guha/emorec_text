hi guys someone recently had a question,0.0,5.22,5.22,
about proton pump inhibitors PPIs okay,1.949,5.461,7.41,
so first of all I want to just give you,5.22,3.839,9.059,
a little disclaimer if you're on this,7.41,4.2,11.61,
medication check with your doctor before,9.059,5.341,14.399999999999999,
coming off of it okay this is just meant,11.61,6.99,18.6,
for education all right this these PP,14.4,7.5,21.9,
eyes are basically real powerful anti,18.6,5.88,24.48,
acids and they get rid of acid in the,21.9,5.4,27.299999999999997,
stomach for conditions like acid reflux,24.48,7.59,32.07,
GERD gastritis ulcers those types of,27.3,6.54,33.84,
things this medication is the most,32.07,4.5,36.57,
potent inhibitor of acid production it,33.84,5.19,39.03,
can reduce stomach acid by 99 percent,36.57,4.2,40.77,
that's incredible it's one of the most,39.03,5.43,44.46,
widely sold drugs in the world so,40.77,5.73,46.5,
obviously a lot of people have stomach,44.46,4.669,49.129,
problems so it blocks the pump that,46.5,6.0,52.5,
releases hydrochloric acid but it comes,49.129,5.291,54.42,
with a package there's some slight minor,52.5,3.69,56.19,
complications when you remove stomach,54.42,6.029,60.449,
acid headache nausea and that's probably,56.19,6.119,62.309,
because there's a relationship between,60.449,4.17,64.619,
the stomach acid and the release of bile,62.309,4.471,66.78,
and so if the bile is backing up from,64.619,3.661,68.28,
the gallbladder you're going to feel,66.78,3.24,70.02,
nauseous diarrhea,68.28,3.449,71.729,
probably because you're not getting the,70.02,4.5,74.52,surprise
full digestion and things are undigested,71.729,3.78,75.509,
it's going to go through your body,74.52,3.63,78.14999999999999,
abdominal pain and gas these two,75.509,4.711,80.22,
symptoms are merely the inability to,78.15,4.35,82.5,
digest protein you need a real strong,80.22,4.95,85.17,
asset to break down protein undigested,82.5,5.34,87.84,
protein will give you gas and abdominal,85.17,3.05,88.22,
pain,87.84,2.55,90.39,
anxiety because you're not able to break,88.22,4.359,92.579,
down the proteins into the amino acids,90.39,4.589,94.979,
which turn into the neurotransmitters,92.579,5.761,98.33999999999999,
like serotonin dopamine GABA that,94.979,6.631,101.61,
actually elevate your mood dizziness,98.34,5.76,104.10000000000001,
fatigue of course if you're not able to,101.61,4.2,105.81,fear
absorb b12 you're going to get tired,104.1,4.799,108.899,
bone fractures why because you need an,105.81,5.82,111.63,
acidic stomach to absorb calcium and,108.899,6.36,115.259,
other minerals and protein and collagen,111.63,7.169,118.79899999999999,
also helps build bone muscle damage,115.259,5.941,121.2,
again you're not going to be able to get,118.799,5.221,124.02000000000001,
the full breakdown of the macronutrients,121.2,6.3,127.5,
in to the micronutrients amino acids,124.02,6.18,130.2,
being one of those increased risk,127.5,6.06,133.56,
dementia kitten disease c-diff which,130.2,5.28,135.48,
a bacterial infection in your digestive,133.56,4.59,138.15,
system which usually comes after taking,135.48,5.04,140.51999999999998,
antibiotics but it can also come from,138.15,5.28,143.43,
taking and a powerful anti acid small,140.52,4.95,145.47,
intestine bacterial overgrowth and,143.43,5.779,149.209,
fungus and Candida because you need that,145.47,6.42,151.89,
acidifier to kill off the unfriendly,149.209,4.481,153.69,
microbes so if you don't have that,151.89,3.24,155.13,surprise
you're going to get an overgrowth of the,153.69,5.46,159.15,
unfriendly bacteria if you don't have,155.13,6.15,161.28,
enough stomach acid and you go to a,159.15,3.9,163.05,
restaurant where they have raw fish for,161.28,3.84,165.12,
example like a sushi restaurant and,163.05,3.84,166.89000000000001,
there's a lot of microbes in that fish,165.12,4.35,169.47,fear
that normally should be killed by the,166.89,4.26,171.14999999999998,fear
stomach acid so if you don't have that,169.47,3.96,173.43,
in there the chances of you getting an,171.15,4.919,176.06900000000002,
infection lower in the GI tract is very,173.43,5.61,179.04000000000002,
high so that's not good,176.069,5.821,181.89,
increased risk of polyps colitis which,179.04,4.86,183.9,
is inflammation of the colon and another,181.89,4.11,186.0,
condition called hypochloride Rio which,183.9,4.26,188.16,
is low of stomach acids which will give,186.0,5.22,191.22,
you an e mia decrease b12 which again a,188.16,4.74,192.9,
whole series of additional symptoms just,191.22,3.96,195.18,
with that decrease absorption of vitamin,192.9,6.929,199.829,
C B and K increased risk of infections,195.18,6.39,201.57,
we talked about that overgrowth of,199.829,4.951,204.78,
bacteria and increase risk of carcinoma,201.57,4.889,206.459,
in your stomach that's cancer in your,204.78,4.049,208.829,
stomach which kind of poses this whole,206.459,4.711,211.17000000000002,
push that you see on the internet a lot,208.829,3.75,212.579,
of people are going oh yeah you need to,211.17,3.21,214.38,
alkalize you're gonna get cancer because,212.579,3.901,216.48000000000002,
cancer only lives in an acidic,214.38,4.919,219.299,
environment really well it also can live,216.48,4.2,220.67999999999998,
in an alkaline environment as well,219.299,3.151,222.45000000000002,
especially in your stomach what I'm,220.68,3.839,224.519,
gonna recommend for a solution and I'll,222.45,4.05,226.5,
put some videos down below of previous,224.519,4.261,228.78,
videos that I've done for stomach acids,226.5,4.38,230.88,
but simply start taking apple cider,228.78,4.709,233.489,
vinegar you put two tablespoons in a,230.88,4.639,235.519,
glass of water drink it with a straw,233.489,5.071,238.56,happy
maybe put some stevia in there to make,235.519,4.84,240.359,fear
it taste a little bit better and do that,238.56,4.799,243.359,fear
with each meal that's a mild handling,240.359,5.311,245.67000000000002,fear
you can also increase your stomach acid,243.359,4.261,247.62,fear
by also taking something called patan√®,245.67,4.649,250.319,happy
hydrochloride which is an acidifier it's,247.62,5.01,252.63,
natural there's no side effects now the,250.319,3.901,254.22,
only time you wouldn't want to use as,252.63,4.44,257.07,
certifiers is if you had an ulcer in,254.22,5.85,260.07,
which case you'd want to consume leafy,257.07,5.76,262.83,
greens chlorophyll things to heal the,260.07,5.92,265.99,
ulcer first but the ultimate solution,262.83,6.04,268.87,
to resolving acid reflux GERD is just to,265.99,6.269,272.259,
get the eating corrected to start eating,268.87,6.06,274.93,
