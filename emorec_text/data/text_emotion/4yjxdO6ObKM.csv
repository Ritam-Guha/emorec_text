hello there this video will demonstrate,0.589,7.06,7.648999999999999,sad
a possible way of solving for a patient,3.6,6.959,10.559,sad
who needs an insulin drip we know that,7.649,4.86,12.509,sad
with insulin drips that regular insulin,10.559,3.721,14.28,fear
will be the insulin will use and we will,12.509,4.02,16.529,sad
mix that with normal saline and so that,14.28,4.46,18.74,sad
would be given as an IV piggyback and,16.529,5.67,22.198999999999998,sad
let's say for this example that we have,18.74,7.51,26.25,sad
in order to infuse the patient with 0.1,22.199,8.641,30.840000000000003,sad
units per kilogram for per hour so we,26.25,10.01,36.26,sad
have orders for regular insulin 0.1,30.84,10.379,41.219,NA
units or kilogram per hour so with the,36.26,6.79,43.05,sad
kilogram in there we notices weight base,41.219,3.57,44.789,sad
we need to have a patient's weight and,43.05,4.11,47.16,sad
in this case we will say the patient's,44.789,5.631,50.42,sad
weight is a hundred and eighty pounds,47.16,5.969,53.129,sad
also what we need is the insulin in the,50.42,5.74,56.160000000000004,sad
piggyback so we're going to say for this,53.129,5.581,58.71,sad
example that we have a hundred units of,56.16,5.129,61.288999999999994,sad
regular insulin mixed into a hundred,58.71,11.76,70.47,sad
units of normal saline we fix that here,61.289,15.811,77.1,sad
a hundred units in 100 MLS of normal,70.47,13.05,83.52,NA
saline okay so we with this 100 units,77.1,9.809,86.90899999999999,NA
per 100 ml you also know that we are,83.52,5.7,89.22,sad
going to have a concentration of one,86.909,7.471,94.38000000000001,sad
unit per 1 ml okay so I can either solve,89.22,7.259,96.479,sad
for MLS per hour I can solve for units,94.38,4.44,98.82,sad
per hour let's go ahead and solve for,96.479,7.831,104.31,sad
units per hour so I start bringing down,98.82,8.189,107.00899999999999,NA
my information that I have I do know,104.31,8.4,112.71000000000001,NA
that I have 0.1 units per kilogram per,107.009,8.701,115.71000000000001,NA
hour so at this point I already have,112.71,5.39,118.1,NA
what I'm looking for,115.71,5.04,120.75,NA
but I do have a kilogram here that's,118.1,4.39,122.49,sad
left over and I need to cancel that out,120.75,6.99,127.74,sad
so one kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds,122.49,11.19,133.68,NA
and my patient weighs 180 pounds now,127.74,8.4,136.14,NA
I'm able to cancel out and all that I'm,133.68,5.009,138.68900000000002,NA
left with are the units I'm looking for,136.14,6.599,142.73899999999998,NA
and then my math at this point we have,138.689,8.731,147.42,NA
an eight point one eight units per hour,142.739,11.31,154.049,NA
infusion okay and since we know that,147.42,10.17,157.58999999999997,NA
this is a one to one ratio that I can,154.049,5.791,159.84,NA
also then just say I have a one point,157.59,4.94,162.53,NA
one eight ml per hour,159.84,8.039,167.879,NA
infusion just to verify that through the,162.53,7.569,170.099,NA
formula let's go ahead and solve for,167.879,6.181,174.06,NA
mils per hour okay so now that I've,170.099,5.34,175.439,NA
solved the units for hour,174.06,5.37,179.43,NA
I'll take this answer here and I'll need,175.439,5.991,181.43,NA
that in order to solve for mils per hour,179.43,8.539,187.969,NA
so mils per hour I have 100 MLS in 100,181.43,10.539,191.969,NA
units so I already have my top,187.969,7.24,195.209,NA
descriptor but I still need hours so I,191.969,6.871,198.84,NA
bring the hours from up here into my,195.209,7.801,203.01,NA
problem I now take the eight point one,198.84,11.28,210.12,NA
eight units per hour cancel out my units,203.01,9.569,212.57899999999998,NA
at this point I don't even need this,210.12,5.67,215.79,NA
little train track here because now I,212.579,6.15,218.729,NA
actually have only left what I'm looking,215.79,5.339,221.129,NA
for and then I come here and I say one,218.729,4.021,222.75,NA
hundred times eight point one eight,221.129,4.681,225.81,NA
divided by one hundred eight point one,222.75,3.629,226.379,NA
eight,225.81,6.239,232.049,NA
I also know that I can just take and,226.379,7.741,234.12,NA
cross that out I'm left with my eight,232.049,4.53,236.579,NA
point eight bring it over here and that,234.12,4.289,238.409,NA
tells me that my eight point one eight,236.579,4.11,240.68900000000002,NA
miles per hour is the same as my eight,238.409,4.53,242.939,NA
point one eight years per hour which,240.689,4.23,244.91899999999998,NA
that confirms that I have this,242.939,5.27,248.209,NA
one-to-one solution,244.919,3.29,248.209,NA
you,252.94,2.06,255.0,NA
