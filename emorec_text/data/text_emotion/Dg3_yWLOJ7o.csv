hey bad news for everyone that's looking for a magic pill for fat loss doesn't really exist but what I'm finding through a lot of research recently is that vitamin d3 might be as close as we,0.21,22.860000000000003,23.070000000000004,sad
can get to something that can reduce belly fat and has anything that's out there so let me explain how this works because honestly it's pretty fascinating so what vitamin D is first and foremost,12.21,19.62,31.830000000000002,sad
is a fat soluble vitamin okay it's a fat soluble vitamin that helps regulate mood it can help regulate metabolism and most importantly it regulates where calcium goes in the body but because it's fat,21.51,20.25,41.760000000000005,sad
soluble it means that it's stored in the fat cell now start thinking about this if you have an excess amount of fat or if you're overweight well that means that most of the vitamin D that you,31.56,21.329,52.888999999999996,sad
consume even if you're taking a supplement it's going to get sequestered into those fat cells and it's going to stay there meaning you have less bio actively available vitamin d3,42.749,20.191000000000003,62.940000000000005,angry
to do the cool things that I'm about to explain but let's talk about how vitamin d3 actually burns fat the first method is by increasing something called leptin now have you ever eaten food before and,52.35,26.160000000000004,78.51,angry
gotten full if you haven't you're probably not human because honestly what happens is leptin signals your brain that you're full when you eat a lot of food you have the production of leptin,65.19,23.16,88.35,sad
signals your brain that you're full and you stop eating problem is that without vitamin d3 leptin levels don't generally increase that much so if you have enough d3 your brain can signal and your brain,77.25,24.990000000000002,102.24000000000001,sad
can be told you need to stop eating so that's simple but low levels of vitamin d3 those leptin levels don't get too high and you can keep eating making it very easy to overeat now remember what I,89.73,19.44,109.17,angry
said about the vitamin d3 getting stored in fat cells so think about this if you already are low in d3 and then you eat and you don't have enough left and so you keep eating more well then you're,99.42,20.97,120.39,sad
going to develop more fat cells which means you're going to hold onto more vitamin D in the fat cells and more and more to the point where you have this snowball effect where you continue to,110.13,16.68,126.81,sad
store fat are you one of those people that have just looked in the mirror and said how did this happen to me honestly I was one of those people seven or eight years ago okay now the other way that,118.26,19.739,137.999,sad
vitamin d3 is proving to potentially be a good belly fat burner is through the modulation of the our thyroid and calcitriol hormones you see the parathyroid is a small set of,128.009,19.611,147.61999999999998,sad
gland around the thyroid in our throat and basically when they produce parathyroid when they produce calcitriol we have a rapid increase in how our body stores fat it tends to want to store it,137.98,23.009999999999998,160.98999999999998,sad
more now if we have enough of vitamin d3 the parathyroid calcitriol hormones aren't quite as crazy they're not going quite as haywire which means your body slowly stores and slowly metabolized sat,149.11,25.589,174.699,sad
versus doing it rapidly making it where you look in the mirror and feel like it happened overnight so those are the two main reasons that vitamin d3 is starting to play a big role in belly fat but this,161.709,20.101,181.81,sad
wouldn't be a traditional video of mine if I didn't at least reference one peer-reviewed double-blind placebo study that one study took 218 women get these 218 women they gave a strict diet and,172.39,25.83,198.21999999999997,sad
exercise program - and they asked them to follow it for a year okay then they took half of these women and they gave them vitamin D the other half the women they gave a placebo well after one year,185.32,22.98,208.29999999999998,sad
of time it was found that the wind that took the vitamin D has on average seven pounds more weight loss and those that didn't take the vitamin D it doesn't sound like much but just by adding,196.69,22.47,219.16,sad
vitamin D it's pretty dang interesting but then there's one other study there's another study that found that those that were taking vitamin d3 had a better waist-to-hip ratio than those that were,207.91,19.289,227.199,sad
not so what I can hypothesize from these two studies is that potentially vitamin D could be a link between weight loss being somewhat site-specific to the belly fat area now it's not the,217.209,24.27,241.479,NA
end-all be-all and there is a lot more science and a lot more research that needs to be conducted but in general we're heading the right direction and just so that you guys know if you have,229.87,18.69,248.56,NA
any ideas for videos post them in the comment section I'd love to hear them especially surrounding the world of belly fat especially surrounding the world of vitamins and minerals but also,239.049,17.430999999999997,256.48,NA
