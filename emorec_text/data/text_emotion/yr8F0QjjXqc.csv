function neuropathies can have a significant negative impact on a patient's quality of life but the complications of neuropathy can be even more serious loss of protective,34.05,18.72,52.769999999999996,NA
sensation of the feet leads to foot ulcers and amputations neuropathies can cause balance trouble increasing risk for fall and fractures and autonomic neuropathy scan caused gastroparesis and,43.29,21.839,65.12899999999999,NA
cardiac arrhythmias thus it's important to recognize patients at risk for neuropathy and intervene when possible to prevent its development the most important risk factor for diabetic,54.059,19.47,73.529,NA
neuropathy is long-standing poor glycemic control smoking and alcohol intake along with metabolic abnormalities such as hyperlipidemia and hypertension may also increase the risk,63.899,22.409,86.30799999999999,NA
of neuropathy let's start by taking a look at peripheral neuropathy recognizing neuropathy in your patients is important for early intervention to prevent progression and other,74.909,18.512,93.421,NA
complications the most common form of diabetic neuropathy is symmetric distal sensory neuropathy this presents with symmetric neuropathic symptoms and a glove and stocking distribution it,84.15,20.929000000000002,105.07900000000001,NA
develops following long-standing hyperglycemia and involves damage to small nerve fibers resulting in loss of pain and thermal sensation it can also damage large nerve fibers resulting in,94.829,25.721,120.55,NA
loss of touch and vibration perception and it can cause damage to sensory fibers which causes paresthesias and pain unfortunately there is no treatment to reverse neuropathy thus prevention is,107.34,26.009999999999998,133.35,NA
key for all patients with diabetes you should perform a visual inspection of their feet at each visit to ensure that they have no ulcers or calluses and that their shoes fit appropriately you should,120.27,22.448999999999998,142.719,NA
also assess for loss of protective sensation as this has been shown to increase the patient's risk of developing foot ulcers which can be a serious complication of diabetes the,131.849,19.091,150.94,NA
most commonly performed test to assess for intact sensation is the 10-grand monofilament test and this test a nylon monofilament is applied to the plantar surface of the foot with enough force to,141.31,21.719,163.029,NA
cause the filament to buckle designed to be 10 grams of force this should be performed at four areas on the plantar surfaces the site's most likely to be affected in diabetic neuropathy other,152.049,22.321,174.37,NA
tests that should be performed include assessment of vibratory sense using a 128 Hertz tuning fork this should be placed on the tip of the great toe if the patient is unable to detect a,163.51,23.309,186.819,NA
vibration while the examiner still feels vibration this test is considered abnormal assessment for intact peripheral pulses should also be done at every visit if there's concern for loss,175.09,20.55,195.64000000000001,NA

also cause autonomic neuropathy these may be difficult to diagnose but can significantly impair quality of life the autonomic neuropathy s can affect multiple systems throughout the body one,196.12,22.47,218.59,NA
of the most concerning complications of autonomic neuropathy is hypoglycemia unawareness where patients no longer get autonomic symptoms associated with low blood sugars they're at risk of loss of,207.37,21.539,228.909,NA
consciousness or seizures related to severe hypoglycemic events autonomic neuropathy s can also involve the cardiovascular system and cause resting tachycardia or postural dizziness,218.019,21.211,239.23000000000002,NA
autonomic neuropathy and the gastrointestinal system causes gastroparesis diabetic diarrhea or chronic constipation erectile dysfunction is a common consequence of,228.849,20.250999999999998,249.1,NA
autonomic neuropathy and some patients may also know hyper hydrosis particularly with increased sweating of the upper body and decreased sweating in the lower body the treatment of the,238.69,19.349,258.039,NA
autonomic neuropathy is aimed at managing symptoms in order to improve patient's quality of life for hypoglycemia unawareness a continuous glucose monitor can be life-saving,248.59,19.531,268.121,NA
this will alarm as blood sugars start dropping allowing patients to treat their low blood sugar before they become confused many of these patients also need higher glucose target,258.31,18.649,276.959,NA
to minimize the risk of developing hypoglycemia for patients with orthostatic hypotension increasing salt intake in the use of compression stockings can be helpful if these,267.74,18.991000000000003,286.731,NA
interventions are not enough to control symptoms fludrocortisone may be helpful patients with gastroparesis may benefit from dietary changes consuming several small meals throughout the day,277.25,20.449,297.699,NA
medications that may provide some benefit include metoclopramide which acts to stimulate gastric motility and domperidone which is an option for patients who do not respond to or unable,287.319,20.891000000000002,308.21000000000004,NA
