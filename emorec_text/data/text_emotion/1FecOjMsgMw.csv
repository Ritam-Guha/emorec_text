we're often asked how does a our glucose,20.16,4.09,24.25,happy
sensor measure the glucose,23.08,2.85,25.93,happy
concentrations and someone with diabetes,24.25,3.96,28.21,
and what I want to do is talk a little,25.93,4.23,30.16,
bit about how that happens so the the,28.21,4.56,32.77,
sensor itself is a small flexible probe,30.16,4.62,34.78,fear
that's placed just underneath the skin,32.77,4.53,37.300000000000004,fear
of a person with diabetes and it's in,34.78,4.529,39.309,fear
the interstitial space so there's fluid,37.3,4.74,42.04,
that surrounds the sensor and in that,39.309,4.551,43.86,
fluid is the person's glucose,42.04,5.19,47.23,
concentration and so the sensor hat is,43.86,5.229,49.089,
an electro enzymatic sensor and what,47.23,3.87,51.099999999999994,neutral
that means is there's a chemistry,49.089,4.231,53.32,neutral
there's an enzyme glucose oxidase that's,51.1,5.31,56.410000000000004,neutral
on the sensor tip which reacts in the,53.32,5.399,58.719,neutral
presence of glucose and creates a signal,56.41,5.399,61.809,
that we can measure there's actually a,58.719,5.311,64.03,
number of layers to the sensing process,61.809,5.251,67.06,
and the first step the glucose gets the,64.03,5.22,69.25,
enzyme layer of glucose oxidase and,67.06,5.13,72.19,
breaks down the glucose to create,69.25,6.39,75.64,
hydrogen peroxide and other elements and,72.19,4.86,77.05,neutral
we're concerned about the hydrogen,75.64,3.899,79.539,neutral
peroxide that's created in that reaction,77.05,5.7,82.75,neutral
that hydrogen peroxide then diffuses to,79.539,6.841,86.38,neutral
a base metal layer of the sensor where,82.75,5.789,88.539,neutral
it's oxidized and what oxidation means,86.38,4.61,90.99,
is that the it's broken down into,88.539,5.431,93.97,
hydrogen oxygen and electrons which we,90.99,6.04,97.03,neutral
measure as a current so essentially what,93.97,5.129,99.099,neutral
we're doing is glucose in the person's,97.03,5.19,102.22,neutral
interstitial space is converted into,99.099,5.58,104.679,neutral
hydrogen peroxide at the enzyme layer,102.22,4.86,107.08,neutral
and then that hydrogen peroxide is,104.679,5.25,109.929,neutral
broken down at a base metal layer into,107.08,5.01,112.09,
electrons which we measure as a current,109.929,4.14,114.069,
so we're measuring our current which is,112.09,4.02,116.11,
proportional to the person's glucose,114.069,4.97,119.039,
concentration,116.11,2.929,119.039,
so once the glucose sensor is placed,120.17,5.14,125.31,
underneath the skin of the person it has,122.759,4.591,127.35,
to be connected to the transmitter,125.31,4.619,129.929,
device the mini link and that connection,127.35,5.279,132.629,
process occurs and once that happens,129.929,5.191,135.12,
what what is done is that the the sensor,132.629,5.071,137.7,
is physically connected to the,135.12,5.22,140.34,
transmitter inside this device are the,137.7,4.95,142.64999999999998,
electronics that operates the sensor and,140.34,5.31,145.65,
measures the signal created by detecting,142.65,4.83,147.48000000000002,
glucose in the body and then there's a,145.65,4.8,150.45000000000002,
transmitting element which transmits the,147.48,6.089,153.569,
data every five minutes to our pump or,150.45,5.789,156.23899999999998,
the guardian monitor it's in the pump or,153.569,4.591,158.16,
guardian monitor that the calibration,156.239,4.291,160.53,neutral
process takes place the signals are,158.16,4.409,162.569,neutral
transmitted from here to that device but,160.53,3.989,164.519,neutral
once in the device that's where a meter,162.569,4.711,167.28,neutral
value is entered into the system,164.519,4.83,169.34900000000002,neutral
that performs the calibration processes,167.28,4.019,171.299,neutral
so the algorithm that converts the,169.349,4.23,173.57899999999998,neutral
signal into glucose is also housed,171.299,7.101,178.4,
within the pump or the guardian monitor,173.579,4.821,178.4,
so so once the sensor measures a signal,179.79,5.169,184.959,
which is proportional to the glucose,183.34,3.629,186.969,neutral
concentration and again that's a current,184.959,4.411,189.37,neutral
we need to convert that signal into the,186.969,4.261,191.23,neutral
glucose concentration and the way we do,189.37,3.089,192.459,neutral
that is through a process called,191.23,4.56,195.79,neutral
calibration and there's an algorithm in,192.459,4.92,197.379,neutral
the pump system or in our Guardian,195.79,4.979,200.769,neutral
platform which allows the user to enter,197.379,5.94,203.319,neutral
a finger stick glucose reading into the,200.769,4.59,205.359,neutral
device and then that reading is,203.319,4.441,207.76,neutral
correlated to the actual signal that the,205.359,4.621,209.98000000000002,neutral
sensors measured and it converts,207.76,3.899,211.659,neutral
therefore it develops a factor that,209.98,3.869,213.849,neutral
converts the sensor signal to glucose,211.659,3.961,215.62,neutral
concentration from that point moving,213.849,3.991,217.84,neutral
forward so that as the sensor signals,215.62,5.1,220.72,neutral
change over time so does the calculated,217.84,4.59,222.43,neutral
glucose reading that the state that the,220.72,4.5,225.22,neutral
sensor is providing important safety,222.43,3.479,225.90900000000002,neutral
