we're often asked how does a our glucose,20.16,4.09,24.25,sad
sensor measure the glucose,23.08,2.85,25.93,sad
concentrations and someone with diabetes,24.25,3.96,28.21,sad
and what I want to do is talk a little,25.93,4.23,30.16,sad
bit about how that happens so the the,28.21,4.56,32.77,sad
sensor itself is a small flexible probe,30.16,4.62,34.78,sad
that's placed just underneath the skin,32.77,4.53,37.300000000000004,sad
of a person with diabetes and it's in,34.78,4.529,39.309,fear
the interstitial space so there's fluid,37.3,4.74,42.04,sad
that surrounds the sensor and in that,39.309,4.551,43.86,sad
fluid is the person's glucose,42.04,5.19,47.23,sad
concentration and so the sensor hat is,43.86,5.229,49.089,sad
an electro enzymatic sensor and what,47.23,3.87,51.099999999999994,sad
that means is there's a chemistry,49.089,4.231,53.32,sad
there's an enzyme glucose oxidase that's,51.1,5.31,56.410000000000004,sad
on the sensor tip which reacts in the,53.32,5.399,58.719,sad
presence of glucose and creates a signal,56.41,5.399,61.809,sad
that we can measure there's actually a,58.719,5.311,64.03,sad
number of layers to the sensing process,61.809,5.251,67.06,sad
and the first step the glucose gets the,64.03,5.22,69.25,NA
enzyme layer of glucose oxidase and,67.06,5.13,72.19,NA
breaks down the glucose to create,69.25,6.39,75.64,sad
hydrogen peroxide and other elements and,72.19,4.86,77.05,sad
we're concerned about the hydrogen,75.64,3.899,79.539,fear
peroxide that's created in that reaction,77.05,5.7,82.75,fear
that hydrogen peroxide then diffuses to,79.539,6.841,86.38,neutral
a base metal layer of the sensor where,82.75,5.789,88.539,neutral
it's oxidized and what oxidation means,86.38,4.61,90.99,fear
is that the it's broken down into,88.539,5.431,93.97,sad
hydrogen oxygen and electrons which we,90.99,6.04,97.03,sad
measure as a current so essentially what,93.97,5.129,99.099,neutral
we're doing is glucose in the person's,97.03,5.19,102.22,neutral
interstitial space is converted into,99.099,5.58,104.679,fear
hydrogen peroxide at the enzyme layer,102.22,4.86,107.08,fear
and then that hydrogen peroxide is,104.679,5.25,109.929,neutral
broken down at a base metal layer into,107.08,5.01,112.09,neutral
electrons which we measure as a current,109.929,4.14,114.069,neutral
so we're measuring our current which is,112.09,4.02,116.11,NA
proportional to the person's glucose,114.069,4.97,119.039,NA
concentration,116.11,2.929,119.039,NA
so once the glucose sensor is placed,120.17,5.14,125.31,NA
underneath the skin of the person it has,122.759,4.591,127.35,NA
to be connected to the transmitter,125.31,4.619,129.929,NA
device the mini link and that connection,127.35,5.279,132.629,NA
process occurs and once that happens,129.929,5.191,135.12,NA
what what is done is that the the sensor,132.629,5.071,137.7,NA
is physically connected to the,135.12,5.22,140.34,NA
transmitter inside this device are the,137.7,4.95,142.64999999999998,NA
electronics that operates the sensor and,140.34,5.31,145.65,NA
measures the signal created by detecting,142.65,4.83,147.48000000000002,NA
glucose in the body and then there's a,145.65,4.8,150.45000000000002,NA
transmitting element which transmits the,147.48,6.089,153.569,NA
data every five minutes to our pump or,150.45,5.789,156.23899999999998,NA
the guardian monitor it's in the pump or,153.569,4.591,158.16,sad
guardian monitor that the calibration,156.239,4.291,160.53,sad
process takes place the signals are,158.16,4.409,162.569,neutral
transmitted from here to that device but,160.53,3.989,164.519,neutral
once in the device that's where a meter,162.569,4.711,167.28,neutral
value is entered into the system,164.519,4.83,169.34900000000002,neutral
that performs the calibration processes,167.28,4.019,171.299,neutral
so the algorithm that converts the,169.349,4.23,173.57899999999998,neutral
signal into glucose is also housed,171.299,7.101,178.4,NA
within the pump or the guardian monitor,173.579,4.821,178.4,NA
so so once the sensor measures a signal,179.79,5.169,184.959,sad
which is proportional to the glucose,183.34,3.629,186.969,sad
concentration and again that's a current,184.959,4.411,189.37,sad
we need to convert that signal into the,186.969,4.261,191.23,sad
glucose concentration and the way we do,189.37,3.089,192.459,neutral
that is through a process called,191.23,4.56,195.79,neutral
calibration and there's an algorithm in,192.459,4.92,197.379,neutral
the pump system or in our Guardian,195.79,4.979,200.769,neutral
platform which allows the user to enter,197.379,5.94,203.319,sad
a finger stick glucose reading into the,200.769,4.59,205.359,sad
device and then that reading is,203.319,4.441,207.76,sad
correlated to the actual signal that the,205.359,4.621,209.98000000000002,neutral
sensors measured and it converts,207.76,3.899,211.659,neutral
therefore it develops a factor that,209.98,3.869,213.849,neutral
converts the sensor signal to glucose,211.659,3.961,215.62,neutral
concentration from that point moving,213.849,3.991,217.84,neutral
forward so that as the sensor signals,215.62,5.1,220.72,neutral
change over time so does the calculated,217.84,4.59,222.43,neutral
glucose reading that the state that the,220.72,4.5,225.22,neutral
sensor is providing important safety,222.43,3.479,225.90900000000002,neutral
