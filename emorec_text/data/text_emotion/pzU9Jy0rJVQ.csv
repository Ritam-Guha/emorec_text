hello let's look at a medication called increasing this is a combination with the dpp4 inhibitor which is alloglifting together with the pioglitazone that's,0.08,16.718999999999998,16.798999999999996,sad
this thiazolidine dion so we know we can give allogliptin 25mg once daily and we will do that with increasing also so increasing,8.48,21.361,29.841,sad
can be given 25 milligram forward slash then 30 milligram of pioglitazone or 45 milligram of pioglitazone depending on how much we want if we have a kidney insufficiency then,18.64,21.759,40.399,sad
we need to give less of increasing then we need to give 12.5 milligram of allogliptin forward slash uh for example uh 30 milligram of pm glytozone or 45,30.0,21.68,51.68,sad
of p glycozone and this is when we have kidney insufficiency which means around 30 to 60 milliliters per minute of gfr everything above 60 is the normal dose,41.04,17.921,58.961,sad
one once daily everything that is 30 to 60 milliliters then we give this a half dose of aloe and if we have less than 30 milliliters,50.32,19.76,70.08,sad
per minute then it's contraindicated because pioglitazone is not allowed to be given in kidney sufficiency of less than 30 milliliters per minute,59.92,18.079,77.999,sad
allogliptin is so when we give allogliptin alloglyptin alone which is for example we dealt with that in another video the pedia so vpedia is allogliptin alone then we,68.88,19.76,88.64,sad
can go down as long as 6.25 milligram for a gfr which is less than 30 milliliters per minute remember this but because of,79.28,22.721,102.001,sad
pioglitazone we are not allowed to give increasing below 30 milliliter per minute so please remember that we we know we have different combinations of,90.24,19.679,109.919,sad
allogliptin today we're discussing increasing we have the uh vpedia which alloglyptin alone and then we have allogliptin together with metformin,100.479,19.921,120.4,sad
that could be vip domet so we have different names here and and united states and europe have also a different names for example,109.52,15.919999999999998,125.44,sad
increasing would be called oseni very interesting name so this is a very strange name that is hard to remember actually uh the main thing for a doctor is actually,117.36,19.279,136.639,sad
to remember the substance name there that's the most important so please remember allogliptin can be given together with the p ognetazone and that's in then you need,128.0,19.360999999999997,147.361,sad
to remember the groups as we said uh allogliptin was a dpp for inhibitor and the pioglitaz and the combination that can be uh given with increasing is for example,137.28,21.358999999999998,158.639,sad
metformin so then we have actually uh allogliptin a piaglitazone and metformin the ones that you should not combine increasing with,150.8,20.319,171.119,sad
is another dpp4 inhibitor because we already have one alloglyptin please don't add another one please don't add the glp-1 agonist,159.92,17.601,177.521,sad
together with this because glp-1 agonist and dp4 agonist actually do the same thing but they don't have an additive effect meaning it's useless it's it's not good,169.76,26.319,196.07899999999998,sad
so don't do dp4 don't do with glp1 and don't combine with insulin and don't combine with sulfonylurea combine it either with ah so rather with metformin please remember this,181.519,26.641,208.16,sad
let's look at which side effects do we have of increasing we have for example headache then we can have blurred vision we have,195.36,18.32,213.68,sad
nasal pharyngitis we can have upper respiratory tract infection so i'm going from uh upwards to than downwards then we have for example,205.04,18.319000000000003,223.35899999999998,sad
acute pancreatitis we can have increased liver enzymes and then we can have bladder cancer bladder cancer this is very,213.599,19.52,233.119,sad
interesting bladder cancer but this is all a rare side effect please don't be afraid whenever i'm talking about side effects these are very,223.599,14.961,238.56,sad
rare you will not get bladder cancer okay this is one in i don't know how many thousand and this is really rare so you don't have to be,231.2,15.198,246.398,sad
afraid of that so bladder cancer then we have low back pain arthralgias we're meaning we have a joint pain it can be skin uh prudent as we call it,238.879,20.72,259.599,sad
so it's skin reddening there can also be weight gain weight gain with this type and also a hypoglycemia we usually know that weight is actually neutral or reduced,249.599,31.761999999999997,281.361,sad
with the dpp4 inhibitors but since we have a pioglitazone here then we also can see weight gain so due to the p of glycosome but otherwise please remember that the dp4,265.12,23.120000000000005,288.24,sad
inhibitors are very good for keeping the weight or actually reducing the weight which are the contraindication when are we not allowed to give,276.56,14.96,291.52,NA
increasing so allogliptin or pioglitazone for example uh the the common one for both of these substances would be heart failure type three or four,284.08,24.96,309.03999999999996,NA
or liver insufficiency type 1 diabetes diabetic ketoacidosis this would be the common ones and then for for example pioglitazone we would then have a macro hematuria or bladder cancer,295.12,33.919,329.039,NA
this is two that would be more for pioglitazone due to piolitazone contraindication and then we would have acute pancreatitis for allogliptin,313.36,19.6,332.96000000000004,NA
so these are the main contraindications that can be seen for both medications and then some special for pyoglitazole and some are special for allogliptin i think this will be,323.199,20.801,344.0,NA
enough for today i think thank you very much for listening and have a nice day bye bye,334.16,11.758000000000001,345.918,NA
