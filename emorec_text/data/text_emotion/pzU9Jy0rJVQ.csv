hello let's look at a medication called,0.08,3.04,3.12,fear
increasing,2.32,2.56,4.88,fear
this is a combination with the dpp4,3.12,3.44,6.5600000000000005,neutral
inhibitor which is alloglifting,4.88,3.6,8.48,neutral
together with the pioglitazone that's,6.56,4.079,10.639,fear
this thiazolidine dion,8.48,5.68,14.16,fear
so we know we can give allogliptin 25mg,10.639,4.561,15.2,fear
once daily,14.16,3.52,17.68,fear
and we will do that with increasing also,15.2,3.44,18.64,neutral
so increasing,17.68,4.16,21.84,fear
can be given 25 milligram forward slash,18.64,6.399,25.039,fear
then 30 milligram of pioglitazone or 45,21.84,5.359,27.198999999999998,fear
milligram of pioglitazone depending on,25.039,3.361,28.400000000000002,neutral
how much we want,27.199,2.801,30.0,fear
if we have a kidney insufficiency then,28.4,3.839,32.239,fear
we need to give less of increasing,30.0,4.64,34.64,fear
then we need to give 12.5 milligram of,32.239,3.521,35.76,fear
allogliptin,34.64,4.16,38.8,fear
forward slash uh for example uh 30,35.76,5.28,41.04,fear
milligram of pm glytozone or 45,38.8,4.079,42.879,fear
of p glycozone and this is when we have,41.04,3.44,44.48,neutral
kidney insufficiency which means,42.879,4.16,47.039,neutral
around 30 to 60 milliliters per minute,44.48,3.68,48.16,neutral
of gfr,47.039,3.281,50.32,fear
everything above 60 is the normal dose,48.16,3.36,51.519999999999996,fear
one once daily,50.32,3.68,54.0,fear
everything that is 30 to 60 milliliters,51.52,3.12,54.64,fear
then we give,54.0,3.84,57.84,surprise
this a half dose of aloe,54.64,5.28,59.92,surprise
and if we have less than 30 milliliters,57.84,3.84,61.68000000000001,fear
per minute then it's contraindicated,59.92,2.959,62.879000000000005,fear
because pioglitazone,61.68,4.08,65.76,fear
is not allowed to be given in kidney,62.879,4.801,67.67999999999999,fear
sufficiency of less than 30 milliliters,65.76,3.12,68.88000000000001,neutral
per minute,67.68,3.119,70.799,fear
allogliptin is so when we give,68.88,3.52,72.39999999999999,fear
allogliptin alloglyptin alone,70.799,3.281,74.08000000000001,fear
which is for example we dealt with that,72.4,3.68,76.08000000000001,fear
in another video the pedia,74.08,5.2,79.28,fear
so vpedia is allogliptin alone then we,76.08,4.079,80.15899999999999,fear
can go,79.28,4.879,84.159,neutral
down as long as 6.25 milligram,80.159,7.041,87.2,neutral
for a gfr which is less than 30,84.159,4.241,88.4,fear
milliliters per minute,87.2,3.04,90.24000000000001,fear
remember this but because of,88.4,3.52,91.92,fear
pioglitazone we are not,90.24,4.8,95.03999999999999,fear
allowed to give increasing below 30,91.92,4.559,96.479,neutral
milliliter per minute,95.04,4.16,99.2,fear
so please remember that we we know we,96.479,4.0,100.479,fear
have different combinations of,99.2,2.16,101.36,fear
allogliptin,100.479,3.041,103.52,fear
today we're discussing increasing we,101.36,4.0,105.36,neutral
have the uh vpedia which,103.52,3.919,107.439,neutral
alloglyptin alone and then we have,105.36,4.16,109.52,neutral
allogliptin together with metformin,107.439,4.801,112.24,neutral
that could be vip domet so we have,109.52,3.279,112.79899999999999,neutral
different,112.24,2.559,114.79899999999999,neutral
names here and and united states and,112.799,3.92,116.71900000000001,neutral
europe have also a different names for,114.799,2.561,117.36000000000001,sad
example,116.719,3.601,120.32,neutral
increasing would be called oseni very,117.36,4.48,121.84,neutral
interesting name so this is a very,120.32,3.68,124.0,neutral
strange name that is hard to remember,121.84,3.44,125.28,neutral
actually uh,124.0,4.0,128.0,fear
the main thing for a doctor is actually,125.28,3.679,128.959,fear
to remember,128.0,3.2,131.2,fear
the substance name there that's the most,128.959,4.561,133.52,fear
important so please remember allogliptin,131.2,3.679,134.879,fear
can be given together with the p,133.52,3.76,137.28,neutral
ognetazone and that's in then you need,134.879,4.161,139.04,fear
to remember the groups as we said,137.28,4.16,141.44,fear
uh allogliptin was a dpp for inhibitor,139.04,5.199,144.239,fear
and the pioglitaz,141.44,2.799,144.239,neutral
and the combination that can be uh,145.04,5.76,150.79999999999998,fear
given with increasing is for example,148.239,3.441,151.68,neutral
metformin,150.8,3.519,154.31900000000002,fear
so then we have actually uh allogliptin,151.68,4.559,156.239,fear
a piaglitazone and metformin,154.319,4.241,158.56,fear
the ones that you should not combine,156.239,3.681,159.92000000000002,neutral
increasing with,158.56,4.319,162.879,neutral
is another dpp4 inhibitor because we,159.92,3.84,163.76,fear
already have,162.879,3.44,166.319,fear
one alloglyptin please don't add another,163.76,3.759,167.51899999999998,fear
one,166.319,3.441,169.76,fear
please don't add the glp-1 agonist,167.519,3.121,170.64000000000001,fear
together with this,169.76,4.24,174.0,neutral
because glp-1 agonist and dp4 agonist,170.64,5.52,176.16,neutral
actually do the same thing but they,174.0,4.0,178.0,neutral
don't have an additive effect,176.16,5.359,181.519,fear
meaning it's useless it's it's not good,178.0,7.2,185.2,fear
so don't do dp4 don't do with glp1,181.519,6.321,187.84,fear
and don't combine with insulin and don't,185.2,4.8,190.0,sad
combine with sulfonylurea,187.84,5.44,193.28,neutral
combine it either with ah so rather with,190.0,5.36,195.36,neutral
metformin please remember this,193.28,4.72,198.0,neutral
let's look at which side effects do we,195.36,3.12,198.48000000000002,sad
have,198.0,3.28,201.28,fear
of increasing we have for example,198.48,3.92,202.39999999999998,fear
headache,201.28,3.76,205.04,neutral
then we can have blurred vision we have,202.4,4.24,206.64000000000001,neutral
nasal pharyngitis,205.04,3.36,208.4,neutral
we can have upper respiratory tract,206.64,3.28,209.92,fear
infection so i'm going from,208.4,4.0,212.4,fear
uh upwards to than downwards then we,209.92,3.679,213.599,fear
have for example,212.4,4.0,216.4,neutral
acute pancreatitis we can have increased,213.599,3.441,217.04,sad
liver,216.4,4.08,220.48000000000002,fear
enzymes and then we can have,217.04,6.0,223.04,fear
bladder cancer bladder cancer this is,220.48,3.119,223.599,fear
very,223.04,2.88,225.92,neutral
interesting bladder cancer but this is,223.599,3.841,227.44,neutral
all a rare side effect,225.92,3.12,229.04,fear
please don't be afraid whenever i'm,227.44,3.12,230.56,fear
talking about side effects these are,229.04,2.16,231.2,fear
very,230.56,2.72,233.28,fear
rare you will not get bladder cancer,231.2,3.119,234.319,neutral
okay this is,233.28,3.12,236.4,neutral
one in i don't know how many thousand,234.319,3.041,237.35999999999999,neutral
and this is,236.4,2.479,238.87900000000002,neutral
really rare so you don't have to be,237.36,3.439,240.799,neutral
afraid of that so bladder cancer then we,238.879,3.64,242.51899999999998,sad
have low back pain,240.799,4.08,244.87900000000002,fear
arthralgias we're meaning we have a,242.519,3.401,245.92000000000002,fear
joint pain,244.879,4.72,249.599,fear
it can be skin uh prudent as we call it,245.92,4.879,250.79899999999998,fear
so it's skin,249.599,4.64,254.23899999999998,fear
reddening there can also be weight gain,250.799,6.56,257.359,fear
weight gain with this type and also,254.239,7.761,262.0,fear
a hypoglycemia we usually know that,257.359,7.761,265.12,neutral
weight is actually neutral or reduced,262.0,5.04,267.04,fear
with the dpp4 inhibitors,265.12,5.04,270.16,fear
but since we have a pioglitazone here,267.04,6.08,273.12,fear
then we also can see weight gain so due,270.16,4.64,274.8,fear
to the p of glycosome but otherwise,273.12,3.44,276.56,NA
please remember that the dp4,274.8,3.92,278.72,NA
inhibitors are very good for keeping the,276.56,3.68,280.24,NA
weight or actually reducing,278.72,2.96,281.68,NA
the weight which are the,280.24,3.36,283.6,NA
contraindication when are we not allowed,281.68,2.4,284.08,NA
to give,283.6,2.56,286.16,NA
increasing so allogliptin or,284.08,3.6,287.68,NA
pioglitazone,286.16,5.2,291.36,NA
for example uh the the common one for,287.68,5.6,293.28000000000003,NA
both of these substances would be heart,291.36,3.76,295.12,NA
failure type three or four,293.28,6.8,300.08,NA
or liver insufficiency type 1 diabetes,295.12,8.079,303.199,NA
diabetic ketoacidosis this would be,300.08,6.52,306.59999999999997,NA
the common ones and then for for example,303.199,6.401,309.6,NA
pioglitazone we would then have a,306.6,6.76,313.36,NA
macro hematuria or bladder cancer,309.6,6.159,315.759,NA
this is two that would be more for,313.36,4.399,317.759,NA
pioglitazone due to piolitazone,315.759,3.28,319.039,NA
contraindication,317.759,2.88,320.639,NA
and then we would have acute,319.039,4.16,323.199,NA
pancreatitis for allogliptin,320.639,4.881,325.52,NA
so these are the main contraindications,323.199,4.161,327.36,NA
that can be seen for both,325.52,4.399,329.919,NA
medications and then some special for,327.36,4.64,332.0,NA
pyoglitazole and some are special,329.919,4.241,334.15999999999997,NA
for allogliptin i think this will be,332.0,3.36,335.36,NA
enough for today i think,334.16,3.12,337.28000000000003,NA
thank you very much for listening and,335.36,5.279,340.639,NA
have a nice day bye bye,337.28,3.359,340.63899999999995,NA
