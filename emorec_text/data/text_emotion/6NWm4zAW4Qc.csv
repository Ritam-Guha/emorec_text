today's topic is gangrene macroscopic,0.079,5.671,5.75,surprise
death of tissue with superadded,3.54,5.94,9.48,angry
purification is the definition it,5.75,5.95,11.7,angry
affects the limbs intestines appendix,9.48,4.739,14.219000000000001,angry
etc in this webinar I will discuss,11.7,5.61,17.31,angry
basically diabetic angry they can be,14.219,6.361,20.58,angry
many causes of gangrene namely arterial,17.31,5.549,22.858999999999998,neutral
occlusion like atherosclerosis embolism,20.58,4.08,24.659999999999997,neutral
from meningitis obliterans also called,22.859,3.99,26.849000000000004,angry
as Burges disease and right right as,24.66,5.58,30.240000000000002,angry
obliterans cervical drip etc venous,26.849,5.01,31.859,angry
obstruction like deep venous thrombosis,30.24,3.87,34.11,angry
can cause gangrene neurological diseases,31.859,4.621,36.480000000000004,angry
like hemiplegia paraplegia pressure,34.11,4.98,39.09,angry
ulcers can cause in green traumatic,36.48,4.77,41.25,neutral
gangrene due to direct trauma like,39.09,3.719,42.809000000000005,neutral
thrombosis or indirect due to crash,41.25,4.469,45.719,angry
injuries infection boil carbuncle gas,42.809,5.221,48.03,angry
gangrene due to cost radium diabetes,45.719,4.651,50.370000000000005,angry
itself can cause gangrene and physical,48.03,4.41,52.44,angry
causes like radiation corrosives,50.37,5.79,56.16,angry
medications so let's talk about briefly,52.44,7.349,59.789,angry
on diabetic gangrene diabetics possess,56.16,6.239,62.398999999999994,angry
distinct problems which make their limbs,59.789,5.671,65.46000000000001,angry
more liable to gangrene formation mainly,62.399,5.871,68.27,angry
three factors play major roles one,65.46,5.22,70.67999999999999,angry
sugar-laden tissues of the diabetics,68.27,4.419,72.689,angry
lower their resistance to infection,70.68,5.34,76.02000000000001,angry
after trivial injury to the toe or sole,72.689,5.341,78.02999999999999,angry
of the foot of the heel within hours or,76.02,3.72,79.74,neutral
days several and necrotizing infection,78.03,3.839,81.869,angry
may appear which spreads along the,79.74,4.35,84.08999999999999,angry
muscular fascial plane the infecting,81.869,5.011,86.88,angry
organism may often be gas-producing of,84.09,5.31,89.4,angry
the classical group although any type of,86.88,4.379,91.259,angry
infection may occur including fungal,89.4,5.789,95.18900000000001,angry
infections second in the lower limb,91.259,6.691,97.95,angry
however the arterial occlusive disease,95.189,5.701,100.88999999999999,angry
mainly involves the popliteal artery and,97.95,6.419,104.369,angry
its branches down to the pedal arches it,100.89,5.79,106.68,angry
is important to note that in patients,104.369,4.921,109.29,angry
who are on dialysis it is a peroneal,106.68,6.619,113.299,angry
artery that is most commonly affected,109.29,4.009,113.299,angry
arteries proximal to the popliteal,113.54,6.579,120.119,angry
arteries are usually not affected and if,116.82,6.42,123.24,angry
affected show non diabetic type Atris,120.119,6.331,126.45,angry
chlorosis the third peculiarity of the,123.24,6.03,129.26999999999998,angry
diabetics is diabetic neuropathy this,126.45,7.24,133.69,angry
impaired sensation involves lower limbs,129.27,6.91,136.18,neutral
causing injuries and infections on the,133.69,5.43,139.12,neutral
plaintiff foot as a result of this the,136.18,5.73,141.91,angry
pressure areas of the foot the heel the,139.12,5.49,144.61,angry
ball of the foot become developed a,141.91,5.22,147.13,angry
neuropathic diabetic ulcer and due to,144.61,4.8,149.41000000000003,angry
neuropathy the muscular involvement may,147.13,4.13,151.26,angry
also be seen in the form of loss of,149.41,5.01,154.42,angry
reflexes and deformities like short cuts,151.26,5.68,156.94,angry
for the feet may be splayed and deformed,154.42,4.2,158.61999999999998,angry
calluses may develop and the plantar,156.94,4.77,161.71,angry

dry and wet type gangrene are seen in,181.6,5.37,186.97,angry
diabetics dry gangrene occurs more,183.73,6.39,190.11999999999998,angry
frequently in old diabetic patients dry,186.97,5.7,192.67,neutral
gangrene is only possible when the,190.12,5.4,195.52,angry
infection factor is minimum and the,192.67,4.92,197.58999999999997,angry

infection plays a major role in forming,207.93,5.59,213.52,angry
this type of gangrene which is very much,211.03,7.71,218.74,angry
spreading and can often be lethal the,213.52,6.93,220.45000000000002,angry
