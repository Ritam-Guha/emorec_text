today's topic is gangrene macroscopic death of tissue with superadded purification is the definition it affects the limbs intestines appendix etc in this webinar I will discuss,0.079,27.91,27.989,angry
basically diabetic angry they can be many causes of gangrene namely arterial occlusion like atherosclerosis embolism from meningitis obliterans also called as Burges disease and right right as,14.219,25.560000000000002,39.779,angry
obliterans cervical drip etc venous obstruction like deep venous thrombosis can cause gangrene neurological diseases like hemiplegia paraplegia pressure ulcers can cause in green traumatic,26.849,23.251,50.1,angry
gangrene due to direct trauma like thrombosis or indirect due to crash injuries infection boil carbuncle gas gangrene due to cost radium diabetes itself can cause gangrene and physical,39.09,22.470000000000002,61.56,angry
causes like radiation corrosives medications so let's talk about briefly on diabetic gangrene diabetics possess distinct problems which make their limbs more liable to gangrene formation mainly,50.37,30.92,81.28999999999999,angry
three factors play major roles one sugar-laden tissues of the diabetics lower their resistance to infection after trivial injury to the toe or sole of the foot of the heel within hours or,65.46,24.04,89.5,angry
days several and necrotizing infection may appear which spreads along the muscular fascial plane the infecting organism may often be gas-producing of the classical group although any type of,78.03,22.888999999999996,100.919,angry
infection may occur including fungal infections second in the lower limb however the arterial occlusive disease mainly involves the popliteal artery and its branches down to the pedal arches it,89.4,30.39,119.79,angry
is important to note that in patients who are on dialysis it is a peroneal artery that is most commonly affected arteries proximal to the popliteal arteries are usually not affected and if,104.369,28.548000000000002,132.917,angry
affected show non diabetic type Atris chlorosis the third peculiarity of the diabetics is diabetic neuropathy this impaired sensation involves lower limbs causing injuries and infections on the,120.119,31.941,152.06,angry
plaintiff foot as a result of this the pressure areas of the foot the heel the ball of the foot become developed a neuropathic diabetic ulcer and due to neuropathy the muscular involvement may,136.18,25.37,161.55,angry
also be seen in the form of loss of reflexes and deformities like short cuts for the feet may be splayed and deformed calluses may develop and the plantar foot and if not taken care of it favors,149.41,25.87,175.28,angry
entry of infection the clinical features of debris gangrene are pain in ulceration there may be loss of sensation Doppler signal for pulse may be absent change of color of skin and,161.71,24.84,186.55,angry
temperature when gangrene is impending and there may be abscess formation both dry and wet type gangrene are seen in diabetics dry gangrene occurs more frequently in old diabetic patients dry,174.85,31.41,206.26,angry
gangrene is only possible when the infection factor is minimum and the occlusive factor of the artery is maximum the gangrene slowly progresses with a line of demarkation wet gangrene,190.12,30.26,220.38,angry
is more often seen in younger diabetics infection plays a major role in forming this type of gangrene which is very much spreading and can often be lethal the workup that we'd like to get in these,205.12,31.3,236.42000000000002,angry
patients are we like to see the blood sugar log at the bedside we would like to get hemoglobin a1c levels serum creatinine levels at diabetic nephropathy is a comorbidity wound,220.45,28.290000000000003,248.73999999999998,angry
culture and sensitivity ankle brachial index Doppler study in arterial duplex studies an x-ray or MRI if a stream alight is a suspected overall diabetes should be controlled by medications or,234.73,32.16,266.89,angry
insulin or diet control but vasodilators likes elasto soul and pentoxifylline a low dose aspirin often play a major role care of the foot by avoiding injury keeping it clean and dry,251.17,25.198999999999998,276.36899999999997,neutral
particularly attention to our 30-foot wear is very important and when there is infection antibiotics should be prescribed in early cases of course widespread incision and drainage,263.979,22.040000000000003,286.019,NA
debridement of the wound should be performed careful localized debridement combined with intensive antibiotic therapy has often been successful in saving the lemon the most important,274.889,26.531000000000002,301.42,NA
aspect of such a debridement is a removal of all necrotic tissues inadequate debridement leaving deep necrotic tissues is the main cause of failure of the treatment dragon green is,288.19,28.86,317.05,NA
best treated by postponing any operation allowing auto amputation to take place over a period of weeks thank you,302.62,18.848,321.468,NA
