the human brain is very complex but when,2.01,5.58,7.59,fear
we look at the brains of simpler animals,5.399,5.041,10.440000000000001,fear
we see that the human brain has evolved,7.59,5.34,12.93,fear
from them gradually by changing the size,10.44,4.35,14.79,fear
and the placement of common brain,12.93,4.47,17.4,fear
regions and that diverse animals share,14.79,5.1,19.89,fear
common brain regions again suggesting,17.4,4.26,21.659999999999997,fear
that we can study them in simpler,19.89,6.149,26.039,fear
animals not just in humans in fact we,21.66,6.27,27.93,fear
can see when we compare the human in the,26.039,4.171,30.21,NA
monkey how similar they are we can see,27.93,3.87,31.8,NA
in the rat and the mouse that some of,30.21,3.48,33.69,NA
the same regions are sort of changed in,31.8,4.559,36.359,NA
location and changed in size if we go,33.69,4.98,38.67,NA
all the way down to the shark brain we,36.359,3.72,40.079,NA
see something that looks on the outside,38.67,3.479,42.149,NA
very different instruction from the,40.079,4.32,44.399,NA
human brain below but by understanding,42.149,4.62,46.769,NA
what the different brain regions are we,44.399,4.59,48.989000000000004,NA
can see that in fact the parts of the,46.769,3.84,50.608999999999995,NA
shark brain and the parts of the human,48.989,4.861,53.849999999999994,NA
brain are rather similar that even the,50.609,5.43,56.039,NA
higher processing centers are present in,53.85,4.139,57.989000000000004,NA
the shark along with regions that,56.039,3.93,59.969,NA
control things like movement and,57.989,5.13,63.119,NA
learning so we believe that we can study,59.969,5.34,65.309,NA
brain regions across different species,63.119,4.711,67.83,NA
and understand fundamental principles,65.309,5.901,71.21,NA
about how brains work,67.83,3.38,71.21,NA
