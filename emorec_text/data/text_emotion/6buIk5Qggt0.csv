my name is christine marquette and i'm a,0.64,3.2,3.8400000000000003,
registered and licensed dietitian with,2.24,2.96,5.2,neutral
the austin regional clinic,3.84,2.559,6.399,neutral
and i'm going to talk to you about,5.2,3.2,8.4,neutral
losing weight taking vitamin b,6.399,5.12,11.519,neutral
complex now for most people if they are,8.4,5.68,14.08,neutral
getting enough b vitamins taking a b,11.519,3.361,14.88,neutral
complex,14.08,3.199,17.279,neutral
by itself won't actually help you lose,14.88,3.28,18.16,neutral
weight,17.279,3.76,21.039,
however if you have been very deficient,18.16,4.56,22.72,
in your fruits and vegetables,21.039,3.601,24.64,fear
you haven't been eating a very healthy,22.72,3.52,26.24,neutral
diet say for example you've been eating,24.64,3.28,27.92,neutral
a lot of fast food or you've been eating,26.24,3.279,29.519,
out a lot of restaurants,27.92,3.599,31.519000000000002,
you may actually benefit from taking a,29.519,3.681,33.199999999999996,
vitamin b complex so,31.519,3.681,35.199999999999996,
short term it can help you with your,33.2,3.84,37.040000000000006,
weight loss in the sense that,35.2,4.16,39.36,sad
b vitamins are heavily involved in our,37.04,4.56,41.6,
metabolic pathways they are used as,39.36,3.92,43.28,
catalysts and help our,41.6,4.4,46.0,
metabolism actually function properly so,43.28,4.64,47.92,
if you're just getting back into healthy,46.0,2.559,48.559,neutral
eating,47.92,2.639,50.559000000000005,neutral
taking that b complex can kind of give,48.559,3.921,52.48,neutral
you a little head start can help boost,50.559,2.961,53.519999999999996,sad
your,52.48,4.079,56.559,
metabolism short term if you rely,53.52,5.28,58.800000000000004,
on taking the b complex long term and,56.559,4.32,60.879,
you don't ever improve your diet,58.8,4.16,62.959999999999994,neutral
the effects will not carry over they're,60.879,3.36,64.239,neutral
only going to last again,62.96,3.12,66.08,neutral
short term but you really need to make,64.239,4.001,68.24000000000001,neutral
sure that you are eating a healthy diet,66.08,4.56,70.64,neutral
that does include b vitamins naturally,68.24,3.52,71.75999999999999,neutral
from your foods,70.64,3.44,74.08,neutral
the main way that b vitamins work is,71.76,3.999,75.759,neutral
they work synergistically with,74.08,4.24,78.32,neutral
other compounds found in the foods so,75.759,4.881,80.64,neutral
just taking a b complex vitamin,78.32,4.32,82.63999999999999,neutral
you're not going to get the same exact,80.64,4.4,85.04,sad
effect on your metabolism as you would,82.64,3.839,86.479,sad
if you were actually eating the whole,85.04,2.16,87.2,sad
foods,86.479,3.121,89.6,neutral
so the best thing to do as far as b,87.2,4.0,91.2,neutral
complex is make sure that you're getting,89.6,2.64,92.24,neutral
your b vitamins,91.2,3.919,95.119,neutral
from your foods don't rely strictly on,92.24,3.199,95.439,neutral
the,95.119,3.36,98.479,sad
b complex multivitamin to get your b,95.439,7.201,102.63999999999999,sad
vitamins because that's long-term,98.479,4.161,102.64,sad
loss the other thing to keep in mind is,103.439,3.521,106.96,sad
you're still going to need to include,105.52,3.04,108.56,sad
some type of physical activity,106.96,3.199,110.15899999999999,sad
it's very difficult to lose weight,108.56,3.44,112.0,neutral
without including the physical,110.159,4.161,114.32000000000001,neutral
activity as well as eating a healthy,112.0,4.0,116.0,neutral
diet so those are just some things to,114.32,2.479,116.79899999999999,neutral
keep in mind,116.0,2.719,118.719,neutral
when thinking about b complex for weight,116.799,4.64,121.43900000000001,neutral
