hi guys in this video I want to talk about the relationship between low blood sugars and your brain it's very interesting that normally your brain will run on either glucose or sugar or,0.0,25.759,25.759,sad
ketones which are the byproduct of fat burning but not amino acids or fatty acids okay now when you induce low blood sugar healthily naturally using ketogenic diet or in a minute fasting,11.929,26.772,38.701,sad
you're not going to have the problems I'm going to talk about okay you're not gonna have these symptoms it's actually that's a you want your blood Sugar's a little on the low side but to do it,26.01,17.28,43.290000000000006,sad
naturally and gradually over a period of time okay what I'm going to be talking about in this little section is actual hypoglycemia low blood sugar while you're still eating carbs and you're not,34.71,23.789,58.499,sad
fully adapted to the ketones okay so you're still running on sugar but you have low blood sugars so so here's what happens well there's a couple things you need to know the brain does not store,45.66,24.39,70.05,sad
sugar as glycogen that means it doesn't have a storage like the muscle or the liver so it's dependent on the sugar in your blood so if there's low blood sugar this thing starves okay now when you,58.289,33.871,92.16,angry
starve the brain of glucose you shut down the oxygen to the brain so you starve it a fuel and oxygen well guess what's gonna happen you're going to get a condition called anoxic irritability,74.76,23.459,98.21900000000001,sad
which is basically starving the neurons with oxygen which is very toxic and irritating to the nerves so you actually can kill the nerves you kill the brain now if you have a chronic hypoglycemic,86.909,25.381,112.29,sad
situation low blood sugars over a long period of time you actually create degeneration in the brain and all sorts of neurological issues tremors and a whole bunch of other issues okay so,100.14,23.46,123.6,angry
again that's if you're doing it unhealthily you do it naturally you're not going to have those effects now there is a protective mechanism that happens when your blood sugars go low,111.96,25.490000000000002,137.45,sad
and that's by the adrenal gland and some other organs as well so you get this kick in of the spike of adrenaline when the blood Sugar's go to a low and there's a whole bunch of symptoms that,123.35,24.880000000000003,148.23,sad
can occur if that happens too quickly but your adrenaline and cortisol are trying to raise the sugar up there's other hormones too but I'm not going to get into it at this point so here if,137.22,22.26,159.48,sad
your adrenals are stressed and you have hypoglycemia and you're not changing your diet you're gonna have all sorts of issues because the adrenals will not be able to counter this efficiently so you,147.93,29.999999999999996,177.93,NA
end up have with low blood sugars that don't seem to rebound at a nice comfortable healthy level so it creates a lot of strain on the nervous system okay so the whole goal with this is to,163.23,21.96,185.19,NA
correct the low blood sugar not by adding more sugar into the diet that's never going to work it's gonna always make things worse and there's so many people that are recommending this six,173.79,17.43,191.22,sad
meals a day and eat candy and it's that's the worst advice what you need to do is what's behind the low blood sugar or something called insulin resistance there's a whole bunch of things you can,182.76,20.43,203.19,sad
do to correct that so it doesn't become a problem so eventually you can normalize the resistance normalize the blood sugar because insulin is now healed and then the brain will do a lot,192.24,24.708999999999996,216.949,NA
better cognitive functions mood issues won't clear up so I'm gonna put a link down below exactly how to do that it's called the keto and intermittent fasting eating plan alright thanks for watching,205.02,25.2,230.22,NA
hey before you go definitely sign up for my free keto course I put a link down below it's on messenger in Facebook but it will give you all the basics it's very quick it's like three or four,217.489,23.461,240.95,NA
videos and it's free check it out,228.54,4.34,232.88,NA
