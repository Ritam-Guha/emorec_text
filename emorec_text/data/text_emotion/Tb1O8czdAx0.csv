c so let's talk about cellulitis what is it no it's not that unsightly condition that women get on the back of their legs called cellulite it's cellulitis which,20.96,26.88,47.84,happy
is actually an infection of the skin and soft tissues underneath what causes it cellulitis can occur anytime there is bacteria,34.48,21.118,55.598,happy
introduced underneath the skin it can be from any break in the skin such as a scratch a cut or even a bug bite while working in urgent care i saw a,44.079,21.362,65.441,happy
ton of patients who had somehow gotten a spider bite and this led to a lot of redness and swelling while they are more concerned about the,54.64,17.599999999999998,72.24,happy
spider bite the more important thing to treat is the actual skin infection that the spider bite led to which is cellulitis so what are the symptoms when you have,63.84,20.96,84.80000000000001,happy
cellulitis whether it be due to a scratch or a bug bite you will experiencing a lot of redness that is expanding you may even see some swelling,74.32,20.880000000000003,95.19999999999999,happy
experience some pain around the area or notice some warmth on the skin you may be more at risk to develop cellulitis if you have trauma to the skin if you are a diabetic,84.56,24.32,108.88,NA
if you have circulatory problems such as not enough blood flow to your arms or your legs which can be evidenced by varicose veins if you have any type of liver disease,96.72,19.36,116.08,happy
such as hepatitis or cirrhosis or if you have other skin disorders such as eczema or psoriasis cellulitis may also occur as an infection after surgery where you may,106.32,19.2,125.52,happy
notice redness warmth or swelling around the surgical site some other symptoms of cellulitis that we didn't talk about yet may include,116.96,17.36,134.32,happy
streaks of redness let's say you had a cut on your arm you're noticing redness and swelling there but then you're also seeing a streak of redness going all the way up your arm,124.64,19.92,144.56,happy
also any type of yellow or clear fluid along with pus in a cut or abrasion can represent an infection of the skin if you are noticing any of these,134.64,18.240000000000002,152.88,happy
symptoms or signs on your skin you do need to see a doctor because if cellulitis goes untreated it can get worse and it can become severe if left untreated you could start,144.08,18.959999999999997,163.04000000000002,happy
to develop high fevers or chills nausea and vomiting enlarging or hardening of the red area as well as increased pain or numbness,154.16,18.0,172.16,happy
when you touch the area more importantly cellulitis should be treated right away because if not it can actually leak into the bloodstream causing a serious blood infection,162.8,18.96,181.76000000000002,happy
which can become severe leading to something called sepsis or even death so what is the treatment because cellulitis is caused by bacteria infecting the skin it does need,172.08,24.079,196.15900000000002,happy
to be treated with antibiotics this time topical antibiotics or something like neosporin is not going to cut it you do need to be on an oral antibiotic that your doctor will,183.84,19.361,203.201,happy
prescribe for you if you are also experiencing some pain around the area you can take tylenol or ibuprofen and sometimes applying a cool pack or ice pack can,194.08,20.159,214.239,happy
also help in some cases of cellulitis it can be a severe infection caused by a bacteria known as mrsa or methicillin resistant staph,204.319,21.361,225.67999999999998,happy
aureus in this case your doctor will need to put you on two antibiotics to help clear the infection typically clindamycin and bactrim if your cellulitis isn't improving or,214.4,19.76,234.16,happy
resolving after being on two antibiotics in the outpatient setting then your doctor may suggest that you need to be admitted to the hospital to receive,224.64,16.558,241.19799999999998,happy
iv antibiotics to clear the infection also in some cases although it's rare cellulitis can form an abscess which is an accumulation of pus,232.319,17.681,250.0,happy
underneath the skin if that happens your doctor will need to perform a small outpatient procedure which is going to be putting a small cut in the skin to drain the pus,241.36,18.961,260.321,happy
now let's talk about prevention some ways to prevent cellulitis from occurring would be to keep good personal hygiene and to keep your skin clean you want to,250.56,17.52,268.08,happy
protect your skin from any scrapes or cuts but if you do get a cut you want to wash that area with soap and water gently so that it can prevent any bacteria from getting in,259.68,18.959,278.639,happy
when some people get a cut on their skin their initial reaction is to pour a ton of hydrogen peroxide on the wound they then proceed to continue to clean their wound daily with hydrogen peroxide,269.12,24.081,293.201,happy
i would like to inform you that this is not the best wound care method as hydrogen peroxide can actually be harsh on the skin and cause further breakdown of the skin,281.36,18.959999999999997,300.32,happy
just a gentle cleansing with regular soap and water is all you need to help clean the skin as the wound heals over-the-counter triple antibiotic ointment or something,290.8,17.279,308.079,happy
known as neosporin is also heavily used by people but applying a lot of this can actually introduce bacteria into the skin especially if you're not washing your,299.6,21.039,320.639,happy
hands prior to putting it on so when it comes to neosporin i always tell my patients less is best and always make sure your hands are clean,309.919,16.882,326.801,happy
especially before you apply it to your skin and that wraps up our discussion today on cellulitis i hope that you learned something new as always if you have further questions,318.32,18.8,337.12,happy
