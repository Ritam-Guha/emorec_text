a cut or even a bug bite while working,50.239,4.401,54.64,sad
in urgent care i saw a,52.96,4.56,57.52,sad
ton of patients who had somehow gotten a,54.64,3.36,58.0,sad
spider,57.52,3.44,60.96,sad
bite and this led to a lot of redness,58.0,3.92,61.92,sad
and swelling,60.96,2.88,63.84,happy
while they are more concerned about the,61.92,4.0,65.92,fear
spider bite the more important thing to,63.84,3.599,67.43900000000001,fear

infection that the spider bite led to,67.439,4.161,71.6,NA

notice some warmth on the skin you may,87.04,5.439,92.47900000000001,sad
be more at risk to develop cellulitis,89.68,5.6,95.28,sad
if you have trauma to the skin if you,92.479,4.241,96.72,sad
are a diabetic,95.28,3.92,99.2,sad
if you have circulatory problems such as,96.72,4.48,101.2,sad

cellulitis may also occur as an,113.04,3.92,116.96000000000001,happy
infection after surgery where you may,115.04,2.48,117.52000000000001,happy
notice,116.96,2.56,119.52,fear
redness warmth or swelling around the,117.52,3.04,120.56,fear
surgical site,119.52,3.04,122.56,sad
some other symptoms of cellulitis that,120.56,4.08,124.64,sad
we didn't talk about yet may include,122.56,4.64,127.2,sad
streaks of redness let's say you had a,124.64,4.56,129.2,sad
cut on your arm you're noticing redness,127.2,4.0,131.2,happy
and swelling there but then you're also,129.2,4.16,133.35999999999999,happy
seeing a streak of redness going all the,131.2,3.44,134.64,fear
way up your arm,133.36,3.76,137.12,fear
also any type of yellow or clear fluid,134.64,3.2,137.83999999999997,fear
along with,137.12,4.0,141.12,sad
pus in a cut or abrasion can represent,137.84,4.96,142.8,sad
an infection of the skin,141.12,2.96,144.08,sad
if you are noticing any of these,142.8,3.12,145.92000000000002,sad
symptoms or signs on your skin,144.08,3.84,147.92000000000002,happy
you do need to see a doctor because if,145.92,4.319,150.23899999999998,happy
cellulitis goes untreated it can get,147.92,3.599,151.51899999999998,fear
worse and it can become,150.239,3.921,154.16,sad
severe if left untreated you could start,151.519,3.281,154.8,sad
to develop,154.16,3.2,157.35999999999999,sad
high fevers or chills nausea and,154.8,3.28,158.08,sad
vomiting,157.36,3.36,160.72000000000003,sad
enlarging or hardening of the red area,158.08,4.72,162.8,sad
as well as increased pain or numbness,160.72,3.44,164.16,sad
when you touch the area,162.8,3.12,165.92000000000002,happy
more importantly cellulitis should be,164.16,3.84,168.0,sad
treated right away because if not it can,165.92,3.92,169.83999999999997,sad
actually leak into the bloodstream,168.0,4.08,172.08,sad
causing a serious blood infection,169.84,4.0,173.84,sad
which can become severe leading to,172.08,4.32,176.4,sad
something called sepsis or even death,173.84,5.44,179.28,sad
so what is the treatment because,176.4,4.559,180.959,happy
cellulitis is caused by,179.28,4.56,183.84,happy
bacteria infecting the skin it does need,180.959,5.2,186.159,sad
to be treated with antibiotics,183.84,4.319,188.159,sad
this time topical antibiotics or,186.159,4.321,190.48,sad
something like neosporin is not going to,188.159,4.401,192.56,sad
cut it you do need to be on an oral,190.48,3.6,194.07999999999998,sad
antibiotic that your doctor will,192.56,2.72,195.28,NA
prescribe for you,194.08,3.6,197.68,happy
if you are also experiencing some pain,195.28,3.92,199.2,sad
around the area you can take,197.68,4.24,201.92000000000002,sad
tylenol or ibuprofen and sometimes,199.2,5.119,204.319,sad
applying a cool pack or ice pack can,201.92,3.28,205.2,sad
also help,204.319,3.361,207.67999999999998,happy
in some cases of cellulitis it can be a,205.2,4.88,210.07999999999998,sad
severe infection caused by a bacteria,207.68,3.16,210.84,sad
known as,210.08,4.32,214.4,sad
mrsa or methicillin resistant staph,210.84,5.64,216.48,sad
aureus in this case your doctor will,214.4,4.08,218.48000000000002,sad
need to put you on two antibiotics to,216.48,3.36,219.84,sad
help clear the infection,218.48,4.319,222.79899999999998,happy
typically clindamycin and bactrim if,219.84,4.8,224.64000000000001,happy
your cellulitis isn't improving or,222.799,3.201,226.0,sad
resolving after being on,224.64,3.2,227.83999999999997,sad
two antibiotics in the outpatient,226.0,3.76,229.76,sad
setting then your doctor may suggest,227.84,3.28,231.12,sad
that you need to be admitted to the,229.76,2.559,232.319,sad
hospital to receive,231.12,3.759,234.879,NA
iv antibiotics to clear the infection,232.319,4.801,237.11999999999998,happy
also in some cases although it's rare,234.879,3.36,238.239,sad
cellulitis can,237.12,3.679,240.799,sad
form an abscess which is an accumulation,238.239,3.121,241.36,sad
of pus,240.799,2.72,243.519,sad
underneath the skin if that happens your,241.36,4.0,245.36,sad
doctor will need to perform a small,243.519,3.92,247.439,sad
outpatient procedure which is going to,245.36,4.0,249.36,sad
be putting a small cut in the skin to,247.439,3.121,250.56,sad
drain the pus,249.36,3.92,253.28,sad
now let's talk about prevention some,250.56,3.44,254.0,happy
ways to prevent,253.28,2.48,255.76,happy
cellulitis from occurring would be to,254.0,3.44,257.44,sad
keep good personal hygiene,255.76,3.92,259.68,sad
and to keep your skin clean you want to,257.44,4.24,261.68,sad
protect your skin from any scrapes or,259.68,4.079,263.759,sad
cuts but if you do get a cut you want to,261.68,4.239,265.919,sad
wash that area with soap and water,263.759,3.681,267.44,NA
gently so that it can prevent any,265.919,3.201,269.12,fear
bacteria from getting in,267.44,3.759,271.199,sad
when some people get a cut on their skin,269.12,4.56,273.68,sad
their initial reaction is to pour a ton,271.199,5.521,276.72,sad
of hydrogen peroxide on the wound they,273.68,5.2,278.88,sad
then proceed to continue to clean their,276.72,4.64,281.36,sad
wound daily with hydrogen peroxide,278.88,4.16,283.04,sad
i would like to inform you that this is,281.36,3.6,284.96000000000004,sad
not the best wound care method as,283.04,4.0,287.04,happy
hydrogen peroxide can actually be,284.96,4.239,289.19899999999996,NA
harsh on the skin and cause further,287.04,3.76,290.8,NA
breakdown of the skin,289.199,3.361,292.56,NA
just a gentle cleansing with regular,290.8,3.52,294.32,sad
soap and water is all you need to help,292.56,2.56,295.12,sad
clean the skin,294.32,2.96,297.28,sad
as the wound heals over-the-counter,295.12,4.48,299.6,sad
triple antibiotic ointment or something,297.28,3.759,301.039,sad
known as neosporin,299.6,4.319,303.91900000000004,fear
is also heavily used by people but,301.039,4.801,305.84,happy
applying a lot of this can actually,303.919,3.921,307.84,sad
introduce bacteria into the skin,305.84,4.079,309.919,sad
especially if you're not washing your,307.84,3.919,311.75899999999996,sad
hands prior to putting it on,309.919,3.921,313.84,sad
so when it comes to neosporin i always,311.759,3.041,314.8,sad
tell my patients,313.84,3.12,316.96,sad
less is best and always make sure your,314.8,3.52,318.32,sad
hands are clean,316.96,3.28,320.23999999999995,sad
especially before you apply it to your,318.32,3.84,322.15999999999997,sad
skin and that wraps up our discussion,320.24,4.239,324.479,happy
today on cellulitis i hope that you,322.16,3.599,325.759,happy
learned something new,324.479,3.201,327.68,sad
