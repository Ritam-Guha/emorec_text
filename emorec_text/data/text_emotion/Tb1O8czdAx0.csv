let's talk about cellulitis what is it,21.84,6.24,28.08,happy
no it's not that unsightly condition,26.08,3.92,30.0,happy
that women get on the back of their legs,28.08,6.4,34.48,happy
called cellulite it's cellulitis which,30.0,5.2,35.2,happy
is actually,34.48,2.96,37.44,happy
an infection of the skin and soft,35.2,3.76,38.96,
tissues underneath,37.44,4.72,42.16,happy
what causes it cellulitis can occur,38.96,5.119,44.079,happy
anytime there is bacteria,42.16,4.559,46.718999999999994,happy
introduced underneath the skin it can be,44.079,3.041,47.12,fear
from,46.719,3.52,50.239000000000004,happy
any break in the skin such as a scratch,47.12,5.84,52.959999999999994,happy
a cut or even a bug bite while working,50.239,4.401,54.64,happy
in urgent care i saw a,52.96,4.56,57.52,happy
ton of patients who had somehow gotten a,54.64,3.36,58.0,happy
spider,57.52,3.44,60.96,happy
bite and this led to a lot of redness,58.0,3.92,61.92,happy
and swelling,60.96,2.88,63.84,happy
while they are more concerned about the,61.92,4.0,65.92,fear
spider bite the more important thing to,63.84,3.599,67.43900000000001,fear
treat is the actual skin,65.92,3.6,69.52,fear
infection that the spider bite led to,67.439,4.161,71.6,
which is cellulitis,69.52,4.8,74.32,
so what are the symptoms when you have,71.6,4.8,76.39999999999999,happy
cellulitis whether it be due to a,74.32,3.92,78.24,happy

you will experiencing a lot of redness,78.24,4.239,82.479,fear
that is expanding,80.96,3.6,84.55999999999999,
you may even see some swelling,82.479,4.561,87.03999999999999,fear
experience some pain around the area or,84.56,5.12,89.68,fear
notice some warmth on the skin you may,87.04,5.439,92.47900000000001,sad
be more at risk to develop cellulitis,89.68,5.6,95.28,sad
if you have trauma to the skin if you,92.479,4.241,96.72,fear
are a diabetic,95.28,3.92,99.2,fear
if you have circulatory problems such as,96.72,4.48,101.2,fear
not enough blood flow to your arms or,99.2,4.08,103.28,sad
your legs which can be evidenced by,101.2,3.279,104.479,sad
varicose veins,103.28,3.04,106.32000000000001,fear
if you have any type of liver disease,104.479,4.481,108.96,fear
such as hepatitis or cirrhosis,106.32,4.64,110.96,fear
or if you have other skin disorders such,108.96,4.08,113.03999999999999,happy
as eczema or psoriasis,110.96,4.08,115.03999999999999,happy
cellulitis may also occur as an,113.04,3.92,116.96000000000001,happy
infection after surgery where you may,115.04,2.48,117.52000000000001,happy
notice,116.96,2.56,119.52,fear
redness warmth or swelling around the,117.52,3.04,120.56,fear
surgical site,119.52,3.04,122.56,happy
some other symptoms of cellulitis that,120.56,4.08,124.64,happy
we didn't talk about yet may include,122.56,4.64,127.2,happy
streaks of redness let's say you had a,124.64,4.56,129.2,happy
cut on your arm you're noticing redness,127.2,4.0,131.2,happy
and swelling there but then you're also,129.2,4.16,133.35999999999999,happy
seeing a streak of redness going all the,131.2,3.44,134.64,fear
way up your arm,133.36,3.76,137.12,fear
also any type of yellow or clear fluid,134.64,3.2,137.83999999999997,fear
along with,137.12,4.0,141.12,happy
pus in a cut or abrasion can represent,137.84,4.96,142.8,happy
an infection of the skin,141.12,2.96,144.08,happy
if you are noticing any of these,142.8,3.12,145.92000000000002,happy
symptoms or signs on your skin,144.08,3.84,147.92000000000002,happy
you do need to see a doctor because if,145.92,4.319,150.23899999999998,happy
cellulitis goes untreated it can get,147.92,3.599,151.51899999999998,fear
worse and it can become,150.239,3.921,154.16,fear
severe if left untreated you could start,151.519,3.281,154.8,fear
to develop,154.16,3.2,157.35999999999999,happy
high fevers or chills nausea and,154.8,3.28,158.08,happy
vomiting,157.36,3.36,160.72000000000003,happy
enlarging or hardening of the red area,158.08,4.72,162.8,happy
as well as increased pain or numbness,160.72,3.44,164.16,fear
when you touch the area,162.8,3.12,165.92000000000002,happy
more importantly cellulitis should be,164.16,3.84,168.0,happy
treated right away because if not it can,165.92,3.92,169.83999999999997,happy
actually leak into the bloodstream,168.0,4.08,172.08,happy
causing a serious blood infection,169.84,4.0,173.84,happy
which can become severe leading to,172.08,4.32,176.4,happy
something called sepsis or even death,173.84,5.44,179.28,happy
so what is the treatment because,176.4,4.559,180.959,happy
cellulitis is caused by,179.28,4.56,183.84,happy
bacteria infecting the skin it does need,180.959,5.2,186.159,happy
to be treated with antibiotics,183.84,4.319,188.159,happy
this time topical antibiotics or,186.159,4.321,190.48,happy
something like neosporin is not going to,188.159,4.401,192.56,happy
cut it you do need to be on an oral,190.48,3.6,194.07999999999998,happy
antibiotic that your doctor will,192.56,2.72,195.28,
prescribe for you,194.08,3.6,197.68,happy
if you are also experiencing some pain,195.28,3.92,199.2,happy
around the area you can take,197.68,4.24,201.92000000000002,happy
tylenol or ibuprofen and sometimes,199.2,5.119,204.319,happy
applying a cool pack or ice pack can,201.92,3.28,205.2,happy
also help,204.319,3.361,207.67999999999998,happy
in some cases of cellulitis it can be a,205.2,4.88,210.07999999999998,happy
severe infection caused by a bacteria,207.68,3.16,210.84,happy
known as,210.08,4.32,214.4,happy
mrsa or methicillin resistant staph,210.84,5.64,216.48,happy
aureus in this case your doctor will,214.4,4.08,218.48000000000002,happy
need to put you on two antibiotics to,216.48,3.36,219.84,happy
help clear the infection,218.48,4.319,222.79899999999998,happy
typically clindamycin and bactrim if,219.84,4.8,224.64000000000001,happy
your cellulitis isn't improving or,222.799,3.201,226.0,happy
resolving after being on,224.64,3.2,227.83999999999997,happy
two antibiotics in the outpatient,226.0,3.76,229.76,happy
setting then your doctor may suggest,227.84,3.28,231.12,happy
that you need to be admitted to the,229.76,2.559,232.319,
hospital to receive,231.12,3.759,234.879,
iv antibiotics to clear the infection,232.319,4.801,237.11999999999998,happy
also in some cases although it's rare,234.879,3.36,238.239,happy
cellulitis can,237.12,3.679,240.799,happy
form an abscess which is an accumulation,238.239,3.121,241.36,happy
of pus,240.799,2.72,243.519,happy
underneath the skin if that happens your,241.36,4.0,245.36,sad
doctor will need to perform a small,243.519,3.92,247.439,sad
outpatient procedure which is going to,245.36,4.0,249.36,sad
be putting a small cut in the skin to,247.439,3.121,250.56,sad
drain the pus,249.36,3.92,253.28,happy
now let's talk about prevention some,250.56,3.44,254.0,happy
ways to prevent,253.28,2.48,255.76,happy
cellulitis from occurring would be to,254.0,3.44,257.44,happy
keep good personal hygiene,255.76,3.92,259.68,happy
and to keep your skin clean you want to,257.44,4.24,261.68,happy
protect your skin from any scrapes or,259.68,4.079,263.759,happy
cuts but if you do get a cut you want to,261.68,4.239,265.919,sad
wash that area with soap and water,263.759,3.681,267.44,
gently so that it can prevent any,265.919,3.201,269.12,fear
bacteria from getting in,267.44,3.759,271.199,fear
when some people get a cut on their skin,269.12,4.56,273.68,happy
their initial reaction is to pour a ton,271.199,5.521,276.72,happy
of hydrogen peroxide on the wound they,273.68,5.2,278.88,happy
then proceed to continue to clean their,276.72,4.64,281.36,happy
wound daily with hydrogen peroxide,278.88,4.16,283.04,happy
i would like to inform you that this is,281.36,3.6,284.96000000000004,happy
not the best wound care method as,283.04,4.0,287.04,happy
hydrogen peroxide can actually be,284.96,4.239,289.19899999999996,
harsh on the skin and cause further,287.04,3.76,290.8,
breakdown of the skin,289.199,3.361,292.56,
just a gentle cleansing with regular,290.8,3.52,294.32,
soap and water is all you need to help,292.56,2.56,295.12,happy
clean the skin,294.32,2.96,297.28,happy
as the wound heals over-the-counter,295.12,4.48,299.6,happy
triple antibiotic ointment or something,297.28,3.759,301.039,happy
known as neosporin,299.6,4.319,303.91900000000004,fear
is also heavily used by people but,301.039,4.801,305.84,happy
applying a lot of this can actually,303.919,3.921,307.84,happy
introduce bacteria into the skin,305.84,4.079,309.919,happy
especially if you're not washing your,307.84,3.919,311.75899999999996,sad
hands prior to putting it on,309.919,3.921,313.84,happy
so when it comes to neosporin i always,311.759,3.041,314.8,happy
tell my patients,313.84,3.12,316.96,happy
less is best and always make sure your,314.8,3.52,318.32,happy
hands are clean,316.96,3.28,320.23999999999995,fear
especially before you apply it to your,318.32,3.84,322.15999999999997,happy
skin and that wraps up our discussion,320.24,4.239,324.479,happy
today on cellulitis i hope that you,322.16,3.599,325.759,happy
