hey guys in this video we're gonna talk,0.03,4.37,4.4,
about a hidden cause of diabetes type 1,1.35,5.94,7.290000000000001,
actually in some cases type 2 as well so,4.4,6.94,11.34,
alloxan targets the beta cells of the,7.29,6.69,13.98,
pancreas those are the cells that make,11.34,3.959,15.299,surprise
insulin okay,13.98,3.93,17.91,
and diabetes type 1 is a destruction of,15.299,5.431,20.73,
the beta cells and your pancreas this,17.91,5.31,23.22,
chemical is used to induce diabetes and,20.73,4.559,25.289,
laboratory animals ok so if you've been,23.22,3.66,26.88,
watching my videos and applying all this,25.289,3.961,29.25,
information to your body you have no,26.88,3.84,30.72,
worries at all because you're not going,29.25,3.509,32.759,
to be exposed to a locsin because,30.72,4.97,35.69,
alloxan is really in the refined flour,32.759,6.361,39.12,
products when you combine the bleaching,35.69,6.1,41.79,
product that they used for flowers to,39.12,4.92,44.04,
make it into white white flour,41.79,5.4,47.19,
it's called chlorine oxide it combines,44.04,5.789,49.829,
with the protein in the flour to form a,47.19,6.06,53.25,
Locsin so really Locsin is made from,49.829,5.851,55.68,
something that bleaches the flour so I'm,53.25,5.18,58.43,happy
talking about the flour to make breads,55.68,7.679,63.359,surprise
pasta cereal crackers biscuits waffles,58.43,8.5,66.93,surprise
pancakes pastries those type of,63.359,5.491,68.85,
carbohydrates so then when you get into,66.93,4.32,71.25,
what causes this diabetes in children,68.85,5.309,74.15899999999999,
for example they say what's autoimmune,71.25,4.92,76.17,
yeah but what causes autoimmune,74.159,4.261,78.42,happy
conditions and this could be one of the,76.17,3.839,80.009,
causes so the question is how many,78.42,3.6,82.02,
children that you know that literally,80.009,4.741,84.75,
live on white flour products and of,82.02,4.02,86.03999999999999,
course you're gonna probably hear that,84.75,3.509,88.259,
alloxan is safe for humans and it's only,86.04,4.89,90.93,
toxic for mice and rats and things like,88.259,2.97,91.229,
that,90.93,2.7,93.63000000000001,happy
but of course they probably never are,91.229,3.901,95.13,
going to do a study with alloxan with,93.63,3.12,96.75,
humans because it's too dangerous,95.13,3.48,98.61,happy
hey guys so thanks for watching and,96.75,3.27,100.02,fear
definitely share this video because,98.61,3.36,101.97,
really we need to get people not to buy,100.02,4.8,104.82,
this toxic food anymore hey if you,101.97,4.5,106.47,
haven't already subscribed press the,104.82,3.479,108.29899999999999,
