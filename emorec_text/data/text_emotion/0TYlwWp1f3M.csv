hey everyone it's sarah so in this,0.0,4.319,4.319,sad
pregnancy vlog i'm gonna talk about how,2.31,4.83,7.140000000000001,sad
i filled my 1-hour oral,4.319,5.521,9.84,sad
glucose-tolerance test so does that mean,7.14,4.95,12.09,sad
I have gestational diabetes well let's,9.84,4.65,14.49,sad
find out so when you're pregnant your OB,12.09,4.74,16.83,fear
provider will recommend that you take a,14.49,5.52,20.009999999999998,fear
glucose test and normally women will,16.83,6.779,23.608999999999998,sad
take this about 24 to 28 weeks depending,20.01,5.029,25.039,sad
on whatever your provider decides,23.609,3.631,27.240000000000002,neutral
sometimes women take it earlier if,25.039,3.761,28.8,sad
they've had a history of it,27.24,4.47,31.709999999999997,sad
so at 26 weeks I had to take my one-hour,28.8,5.279,34.079,sad
glucose tolerance test and last,31.71,3.869,35.579,fear
pregnancy because it's my second,34.079,3.211,37.29,happy
pregnancy I passed with flying colors,35.579,3.241,38.82,happy
and did great and I was like yeah I'll,37.29,3.359,40.649,sad
take this test and you know I'm gonna,38.82,4.739,43.559,sad
pass well I got the phone call later,40.649,4.89,45.539,sad
that day that I felt and I was,43.559,4.611,48.169999999999995,fear
absolutely shocked that I failed because,45.539,6.061,51.6,fear
during this pregnancy I have actually,48.17,5.86,54.03,fear
been eating a lot healthier than I did,51.6,6.0,57.6,fear
with my first one so they called and my,54.03,7.74,61.77,fear
result was 146 the cutoff at that OB,57.6,6.66,64.26,fear
office is 130 it really varies depending,61.77,5.52,67.29,fear
on your OB office but I was 146 so I,64.26,5.52,69.78,fear
failed so if you've never taken the,67.29,5.07,72.36000000000001,fear
one-hour glucose test what it tells is,69.78,4.65,74.43,fear
that you have to be fasting mean you,72.36,4.11,76.47,fear
can't eat for about two hours before the,74.43,4.829,79.259,fear
test and you go there and you drink like,76.47,5.039,81.509,fear
this sugary concoction and there's,79.259,4.411,83.67,fear
various flavors I always get the fruit,81.509,4.47,85.979,fear
punch a lot of people don't like the,83.67,5.19,88.86,fear
drinks and they hate drinking it but to,85.979,5.43,91.40899999999999,fear
me it just tastes like a flat soda but,88.86,4.14,93.0,fear
anyways from the time you open up the,91.409,3.991,95.4,fear
bottle you only have five minutes to,93.0,4.2,97.2,fear
drink it and I normally drink it pretty,95.4,3.719,99.119,fear
fast so like less than one minute and,97.2,4.2,101.4,fear
then you have to wait an hour and then,99.119,3.871,102.99,fear
they draw your blood and they see how,101.4,3.719,105.119,fear
much glucose is in your blood now since,102.99,5.01,108.0,fear
I fell that one hour glucose test I had,105.119,6.271,111.39,fear
to take the three-hour glucose test and,108.0,6.57,114.57,fear
that's not exciting to do because it's,111.39,6.479,117.869,fear
long test so fortunately I was able to,114.57,5.31,119.88,fear
make that appointment with my regular,117.869,4.29,122.159,fear
other visit which was just in two weeks,119.88,4.589,124.469,fear
so I had to visit everything together,122.159,3.871,126.03,fear
and I really recommend if you have to do,124.469,4.41,128.879,happy
this that you do that so for this test,126.03,4.53,130.56,fear
the prep was a little bit different I,128.879,4.131,133.01,fear
had to be fasting so no food,130.56,4.759,135.31900000000002,fear
at least ten hours and my appointment,133.01,5.55,138.56,fear
was at 8:15 so if you have to do this do,135.319,4.98,140.29899999999998,fear
it in the morning time gets a little bit,138.56,3.539,142.099,fear
better so I quit eating at 8 o'clock,140.299,6.27,146.56900000000002,fear
that night got up went to the office I,142.099,6.181,148.28,fear
could only have water so I was drinking,146.569,3.42,149.98899999999998,fear
lots of water just to keep hydrated and,148.28,3.569,151.849,fear
the very first thing you have to do this,149.989,3.661,153.65,fear
time is that you have to get a blood,151.849,4.321,156.17,fear
draw there's a total of four blood draws,153.65,5.25,158.9,sad
for this test so you get a blood draw,156.17,4.44,160.60999999999999,fear
that's called the fasting one you don't,158.9,3.149,162.049,fear
have anything on your stomach so they're,160.61,4.019,164.62900000000002,fear
gonna see what your blood sugar was then,162.049,6.3,168.34900000000002,sad
you drink that liquid sugary concoction,164.629,6.33,170.959,fear
again and I think it has a little bit,168.349,3.991,172.34,fear
more sugar in it compared to the first,170.959,3.601,174.56,fear
one and you drink that you have to drink,172.34,4.17,176.51,fear
it within five minutes and then that's,174.56,4.049,178.609,fear
when the clock starts so I drunk that,176.51,3.509,180.01899999999998,fear
down pretty fast because I wanted to get,178.609,5.46,184.06900000000002,fear
this test over and so every hour from,180.019,6.601,186.62,fear
that time that I drunk that they would,184.069,8.64,192.709,fear
draw blood so I drunk it at 8:30 then at,186.62,8.31,194.93,fear
9:30 that was my first straw then at,192.709,4.71,197.419,sad
10:30 was my second draw and then 11:30,194.93,5.279,200.209,fear
was my last straw and then I waited on,197.419,5.72,203.139,fear
my results so two days later they,200.209,5.971,206.18,fear
emailed me instead of calling which it's,203.139,4.72,207.859,fear
usually good I've noticed that if they,206.18,3.209,209.389,fear
email you rather than calling because,207.859,3.151,211.01000000000002,fear
it's usually better news and they,209.389,3.57,212.959,fear
emailed me and told me I had passed my,211.01,3.509,214.51899999999998,fear
test so that meant I did not have,212.959,3.691,216.65,fear
gestational diabetes and I was very very,214.519,4.8,219.31900000000002,fear
happy about that now to be diagnosed,216.65,4.44,221.09,fear
with gestational diabetes,219.319,4.081,223.39999999999998,fear
out of those four results that they're,221.09,4.709,225.799,sad
looking at two of them have to be,223.4,6.03,229.43,fear
abnormal so that wasn't the case with me,225.799,6.511,232.31,fear
and I'm very happy that it wasn't but I,229.43,5.55,234.98000000000002,sad
know that a lot of women are really,232.31,4.38,236.69,fear
freaked out about this test like,234.98,4.649,239.629,fear
whenever you fell your one hour like how,236.69,5.37,242.06,fear
I did I was shocked I did not think that,239.629,4.23,243.85899999999998,fear
that was gonna happen because it didn't,242.06,3.569,245.629,sad
happen with my first pregnancy and I was,243.859,3.141,247.0,happy
really nervous that I was going to get,245.629,3.72,249.349,fear
you know told I have gestational,247.0,5.68,252.68,fear
diabetes so if you do have that happen,249.349,4.741,254.08999999999997,fear
like what happened with me you fail your,252.68,2.699,255.37900000000002,fear
one hour now you have to take a,254.09,4.019,258.109,fear
three-hour don't stress because from,255.379,4.681,260.06,fear
what I have heard from my OB provider,258.109,4.141,262.25,fear
and other women this is very common that,260.06,3.95,264.01,fear
a lot of women fail that one hour,262.25,3.5,265.75,fear
but then they passed the three hour and,264.01,4.32,268.33,fear
I've even heard of women there one hour,265.75,4.8,270.55,fear
glucose tolerance test result being like,268.33,4.53,272.85999999999996,fear
in the 190s but they still pass so if,270.55,4.35,274.90000000000003,fear
you're in that situation right now just,272.86,4.05,276.91,fear
hold out hope that you know it things,274.9,3.87,278.77,fear
are gonna be okay but let's say you do,276.91,4.14,281.05,fear
get diagnosed with gestational diabetes,278.77,4.95,283.71999999999997,fear
first of all you need to know like it's,281.05,5.04,286.09000000000003,fear
not your fault don't blame yourself,283.72,4.32,288.04,sad
don't feel like a failure because I was,286.09,3.42,289.51,happy
already starting to feel like that,288.04,3.99,292.03000000000003,fear
whenever I spelled my one hour because,289.51,4.32,293.83,fear
really what's going on with this,292.03,5.04,297.07,fear
condition is the placenta is really,293.83,6.48,300.31,sad
causing you not to be able to use all,297.07,4.95,302.02,fear
that sugar so it's really hanging out in,300.31,4.01,304.32,fear
