hey everyone it's sarah so in this pregnancy vlog i'm gonna talk about how i filled my 1-hour oral glucose-tolerance test so does that mean I have gestational diabetes well let's,0.0,24.270000000000003,24.270000000000003,angry
find out so when you're pregnant your OB provider will recommend that you take a glucose test and normally women will take this about 24 to 28 weeks depending on whatever your provider decides,12.09,25.699,37.789,angry
sometimes women take it earlier if they've had a history of it so at 26 weeks I had to take my one-hour glucose tolerance test and last pregnancy because it's my second,25.039,20.59,45.629000000000005,angry
pregnancy I passed with flying colors and did great and I was like yeah I'll take this test and you know I'm gonna pass well I got the phone call later that day that I felt and I was,35.579,20.84,56.419,angry
absolutely shocked that I failed because during this pregnancy I have actually been eating a lot healthier than I did with my first one so they called and my result was 146 the cutoff at that OB,45.539,32.321,77.86,angry
office is 130 it really varies depending on your OB office but I was 146 so I failed so if you've never taken the one-hour glucose test what it tells is that you have to be fasting mean you,61.77,24.869999999999997,86.64,NA
can't eat for about two hours before the test and you go there and you drink like this sugary concoction and there's various flavors I always get the fruit punch a lot of people don't like the,74.43,23.939,98.369,angry
drinks and they hate drinking it but to me it just tastes like a flat soda but anyways from the time you open up the bottle you only have five minutes to drink it and I normally drink it pretty,85.979,21.48,107.459,angry
fast so like less than one minute and then you have to wait an hour and then they draw your blood and they see how much glucose is in your blood now since I fell that one hour glucose test I had,97.2,23.070999999999998,120.271,fear
to take the three-hour glucose test and that's not exciting to do because it's long test so fortunately I was able to make that appointment with my regular other visit which was just in two weeks,108.0,27.238,135.238,angry
so I had to visit everything together and I really recommend if you have to do this that you do that so for this test the prep was a little bit different I had to be fasting so no food,122.159,21.701,143.86,angry
at least ten hours and my appointment was at 8:15 so if you have to do this do it in the morning time gets a little bit better so I quit eating at 8 o'clock that night got up went to the office I,133.01,26.52,159.53,angry
could only have water so I was drinking lots of water just to keep hydrated and the very first thing you have to do this time is that you have to get a blood draw there's a total of four blood draws,146.569,20.221,166.79,fear
for this test so you get a blood draw that's called the fasting one you don't have anything on your stomach so they're gonna see what your blood sugar was then you drink that liquid sugary concoction,156.17,24.238,180.408,angry
again and I think it has a little bit more sugar in it compared to the first one and you drink that you have to drink it within five minutes and then that's when the clock starts so I drunk that,168.349,19.32,187.66899999999998,angry
down pretty fast because I wanted to get this test over and so every hour from that time that I drunk that they would draw blood so I drunk it at 8:30 then at 9:30 that was my first straw then at,178.609,33.721000000000004,212.33,angry
10:30 was my second draw and then 11:30 was my last straw and then I waited on my results so two days later they emailed me instead of calling which it's usually good I've noticed that if they,194.93,24.898999999999997,219.829,fear
email you rather than calling because it's usually better news and they emailed me and told me I had passed my test so that meant I did not have gestational diabetes and I was very very,207.859,18.721,226.58,angry
happy about that now to be diagnosed with gestational diabetes out of those four results that they're looking at two of them have to be abnormal so that wasn't the case with me,216.65,25.771,242.421,angry
and I'm very happy that it wasn't but I know that a lot of women are really freaked out about this test like whenever you fell your one hour like how I did I was shocked I did not think that,229.43,24.179000000000002,253.609,fear
that was gonna happen because it didn't happen with my first pregnancy and I was really nervous that I was going to get you know told I have gestational diabetes so if you do have that happen,242.06,20.851,262.911,angry
like what happened with me you fail your one hour now you have to take a three-hour don't stress because from what I have heard from my OB provider and other women this is very common that,252.68,19.490000000000002,272.17,angry
a lot of women fail that one hour but then they passed the three hour and I've even heard of women there one hour glucose tolerance test result being like in the 190s but they still pass so if,262.25,21.5,283.75,angry
you're in that situation right now just hold out hope that you know it things are gonna be okay but let's say you do get diagnosed with gestational diabetes first of all you need to know like it's,272.86,22.049999999999997,294.91,angry
not your fault don't blame yourself don't feel like a failure because I was already starting to feel like that whenever I spelled my one hour because really what's going on with this,283.72,21.09,304.81,angry
condition is the placenta is really causing you not to be able to use all that sugar so it's really hanging out in your blood and I have a whole video where I talk about gestational diabetes,293.83,25.62,319.45,angry
like what's going on on your in your body why you have it signs and symptoms and treatment those lab results and everything like that so if you do get that diagnosis I really recommend that,307.24,18.78,326.02,angry
