"Hello everyone, it's Butter Bob.",1.0,1.37
"And this video is about the difference between
blood sugar and insulin.",2.37,6.53
"You know, a lot of times, I get notes from
people saying, ""my insulin is good, I test",8.9,6.05
"it after I eat.""",14.95,2.39
"And I have to write back to them and say,
(and a lot of you know this already), but",17.34,5.43
"stick around, even if you know this, stick
around, because you might learn something",22.77,3.88
from this video.,26.65,1.11
"I write back to them and I'll say, You know,
you can't probably know what your insulin",27.76,8.25
level is after you eat.,36.01,3.72
"What you're testing is blood sugar and blood
sugar and insulin are two very different things.",39.73,9.21
"And they're not always synonymous with each
other.",48.94,3.83
"They don't always match each other, in fact,
they don't match each other, very often.",52.77,6.629
For a lot of people.,59.399,2.34
And that's what this video is really about.,61.739,2.111
"And this is a kind of a complex issue and
I've wanted to do a video on it for a long",63.85,6.39
time.,70.24,1.0
"But, you know, trying to find a way to talk
about this, that is understandable and that",71.24,6.9
"will mean something to you, in you practical
everyday life, is something that I'm always",78.14,5.5
concerned with.,83.64,2.13
"Last year, in October of 2015, I took an insulin
test, actually a test to test my insulin levels.",85.77,12.849
"Both when I'm fasted and after I took a glucose
load, of just pure sugar.",98.619,11.441
To see what would happen in my insulin levels.,110.06,4.72
"This test is called the Kraft Prediabetes
Test, and it's a bloodspot test that you can",114.78,6.82
"order from a company called Meridian Valley,
I think is the name of it.",121.6,5.75
"Yea, Meridian Valley Lab.",127.35,2.12
"Now, I'm not promoting Meridian Valley Lab
on here, I don't get any money from it for",129.47,5.67
"this channel or anything else, but I have
used them and I always limit what I say on",135.14,5.54
"this channel to something I have done myself
and that I know has results that I can depend",140.68,7.39
"on, so I can pass those on to you.",148.07,2.68
"Listen guys, blood sugar is something that
you can test very easy.",150.75,6.75
"Back in the late 1960's, 70's, they developed
a fairly easy home test that you can do.",157.5,6.45
"And it's got better and cheaper as it's went
along.",163.95,2.98
"You can prick your finger, you can pick wherever
you need to prick on your body, and you can",166.93,4.7
"get a little blood and these test devises,
are, are, you can buy them anywhere.",171.63,5.06
"And you can find out what your blood sugar
readings are, both when you're fasted and",176.69,4.47
"after you eat, or whatever.",181.16,1.53
"You can do tests and people do this, lots
of people do this.",182.69,4.58
"And, and in a lot of ways, it's really good,
because you can kind of test how food is doing.",187.27,7.42
What it's doing to your body.,194.69,2.42
"You know, we're all different, people respond
to foods differently.",197.11,6.36
"So you, you really need to know what some
foods are doing to you.",203.47,6.68
"But, the focus of this channel has always
been, from the very beginning, not on blood",210.15,7.69
"sugar, but on insulin.",217.84,2.13
"And, honestly, at this time, 2016, as far
as I know, there is no simple, immediate,",219.97,10.89
home test for insulin.,230.86,3.099
"If there is, someone needs to write me and
let me know about it, because I'd like to",233.959,3.951
know about it.,237.91,1.079
"As far as I know, to get your insulin levels
tested, you have to either go to a doctor",238.989,6.39
"and get a test, which may not help you and
we'll explain that in just a few minutes.",245.379,7.53
"It'll help you a little to know but we really
need to know more than that.",252.909,5.281
"Or you can order a test, as far as I know,
there may be more than one companies that",258.19,4.67
"do it, but I know that this Meridian Valley,
and I got my test right here, Meridian Valley,",262.86,11.51
"in California, has a test you can order.",274.37,5.9
"They send you a little packet and I'll show
you more about that later.",280.27,4.8
"You take and prick your finger, and you have
to do a little five blood spots for every",285.07,4.93
"hour, for four hours, to see your insulin
patterns.",290.0,5.37
"Not just when you're fasted, but also after
you've had a sugar load, in your body.",295.37,6.94
"And the reason they do that, they're testing
something based on the research of a doctor",302.31,7.229
"that I greatly admire and have talked about
lots of times on this channel.",309.539,4.451
Dr. Joseph Kraft.,313.99,2.19
"Dr. Kraft, at this time is still living and
vital and active.",316.18,4.95
He's his nineties.,321.13,2.379
"And there's a great video interview with him,
here on Youtube, by Ivor Cummings, and that's",323.509,8.581
"a video you need to see and I'm going to link
it in this video.",332.09,6.77
"You need to go over and watch that video,
so you can learn much more about Dr. Kraft,",338.86,4.399
actually from him and from Ivor.,343.259,3.061
"And Ivor's channel is great by the way, if
you're the kind of person that likes to get",346.32,5.189
"some more in depth learning about this stuff,
that's the channel you need to watch, for",351.509,4.572
sure.,356.081,1.458
My channel's more entry level.,357.539,2.44
"But, Dr. Kraft learned, he was a doctor and
still is a doctor, but not practicing at this",359.979,6.621
time.,366.6,1.1
"He was a doctor that learned that people have
a hidden problem, that they don't know a lot",367.7,6.189
about.,373.889,2.37
Everybody depends on blood sugar.,376.259,1.841
"Either their fasting blood sugar, or they
can take a glucose tolerance test, you know,",378.1,5.78
"where they take a glucose load and they look
at their sugars after that, and that's how",383.88,3.689
they diagnose them with a diabetes.,387.569,3.181
"But, you know, blood sugar and insulin do
not really match each other.",390.75,6.24
"For example, you can have high blood sugar
and you can have very low insulin, and that's",396.99,7.549
what you would call Type 1 Diabetes.,404.539,3.841
"Or you could have, a fairly normal to even
high blood sugar and have also high insulin.",408.38,13.129
And we would call that Type 2 Diabetes.,421.509,4.041
"Because the insulin is actually high in Type
2 Diabetics, but because of insulin resistance,",425.55,7.91
"and that's really what Type 2 Diabetes is,
is an insulin resistance disease, or an insulin",433.46,6.489
resistance problem.,439.949,1.631
"The insulin is high, but your body doesn't
react to it the way it should.",441.58,4.929
"So there's an example of blood sugar being
fairly normal or a little above normal, or",446.509,7.111
"maybe even a lot above normal and insulin
also being very high, so that's not a match.",453.62,8.32
"But Dr. Kraft found something even more, a
more important for people like you and I.",461.94,9.069
"He found that about 80 percent of people who
would pass a blood sugar test, a fasting blood",471.009,8.06
"sugar test, or a glucose tolerance test, would,
if they took his test, which tests insulin",479.069,10.271
"levels, they would fail that test.",489.34,4.729
"They would not only fail it, but they would
be what he called Diabetes in-situ.",494.069,4.701
"In other words, they, what we would call Pre-diabetic.",498.77,5.079
"They have this underlying hyperinsulinemia,
there's a two dollar word for you, if you've",503.849,6.211
ever heard one.,510.06,2.34
Hyperinsulinemia.,512.4,1.55
"Chronically high insulin levels that are underneath
and unseen, and for the most part, by most",513.95,6.24
"doctors, not tested at all.",520.19,3.32
"And so, for years and years and years, before
they get this diagnosis of Type 2 Diabetes,",523.51,8.579
"they have this high insulin pattern going
on, underneath the hood, and they don't even",532.089,4.37
know it.,536.459,1.0
Their doctors don't know it.,537.459,1.661
No one knows it.,539.12,1.0
"And if we tested for it, as Dr. Kraft has
pushed, and almost no one has listened to",540.12,9.52
"him, but I think they will.",549.64,4.56
"We could probably find people who were in
trouble, decades, maybe two decades, or at",554.2,7.329
"least one decade before they were ever diagnosed
with diabetes, they would know that they were",561.529,5.731
headed in that way.,567.26,2.53
And this is something that you need to know.,569.79,3.05
"The problem with this Meridian Valley test
that I took last year, two things, one is",572.84,7.08
"it's expensive, yeah, this test is like two
hundred bucks, you can order it, it's two",579.92,6.33
hundred dollars out of your pocket.,586.25,2.24
"It comes and you've got to fast for the whole
night, which a lot of you do anyway.",588.49,5.98
"And then you've got to drink some nasty pure
glucose.",594.47,4.95
"And you've got to test your levels by pricking
your finger and getting blood spots, pretty",599.42,6.71
"big blood spots, I might add.",606.13,4.01
"And you pack all this stuff back up and send
it off.",610.14,2.43
"And I sent, I got mine, let's see, I did it
in October, let me see, I got it here on my",612.57,6.6
"computer, I've got it, I did it in October
of a, I did it October 13th, 2015, but I didn't",619.17,11.38
get my results back until November the 2nd.,630.55,4.27
"So, it was a good two and a half, three weeks,
before I actually got my lab results back.",634.82,7.21
"And, I was pleased with the results, but that
tells you how difficult it is to get this",642.03,5.89
test and the results back on the test.,647.92,3.31
"So, when someone says, I know what my insulin
level is after I eat, I know for sure that",651.23,9.51
"they're a little bit confused on that, because
as far as I know, it's not possible to know",660.74,4.61
"that, that fast or that easy.",665.35,3.19
Not at home.,668.54,1.83
So this is really important.,670.37,2.219
"And, the biggest thing we need to know about
Dr. Kraft's work is that he tested, well over",672.589,6.641
"ten thousand people in his career and, like
I told you, eighty percent of them that looked",679.23,8.31
"good as far as blood sugar goes, looked bad
as far as insulin goes.",687.54,8.19
"So this is a problem that people don't even
know that they have and this goes to the very",695.73,4.89
heart of diabetes.,700.62,3.22
It goes to the heart of obesity.,703.84,2.96
"Listen, guys, insulin is a hormone that stores
fat, I mean we talk about that all the time",706.8,7.682
on this channel.,714.482,1.518
"But insulin is also a hormone that, in high
levels in your body, without you knowing it,",716.0,7.019
is setting you up for diabetes.,723.019,2.961
"It's setting you up for, obesity, cause it's
storing fat.",725.98,3.85
"It's also doing damage your, to the vessels
of your heart.",729.83,4.699
"The whole high insulin problem, or hyperinsulinemia
problem, is related at it's very root, to",734.529,9.99
"so many conditions that fill doctors offices
all over the world.",744.519,6.561
"Especially in the developed world, what they
used to call the Western World.",751.08,7.36
"Heart Disease, Diabetes Type 2, skin problems,
joint pain, chronic joint pain, obesity, as",758.44,14.491
"we've talked about, polycystic ovarian syndrome.",772.931,5.939
"So many problems, too many to list actually.",778.87,4.07
"And, I actually did a video on this, last
year, it was a little long and, you know,",782.94,9.8
"it hasn't done all the well, but it tells
you that insulin is really the root cause",792.74,6.89
of modern illnesses.,799.63,2.49
Chronic modern illnesses that we have.,802.12,3.85
"So you really need to know there's a big difference
between these two things, blood sugar, insulin.",805.97,7.739
"Blood sugar is really a side effect of an
insulin problem, not the other way around.",813.709,7.011
Not the other way around.,820.72,1.21
"Now, say you don't have two hundred dollars,
listen, I never tested my insulin levels,",821.93,6.589
"the entire time I was losing weight, until
I had lost my weight for a long time, by the",828.519,7.361
time October of last year came around.,835.88,2.97
"So I lost all the weight without ever knowing
my insulin levels.",838.85,4.15
"So what do you do if you don't have the money
to get one these tests?",843.0,5.709
"Well, it's easy, if you're losing weight,
if you're losing weight, and I'm not talking",848.709,8.141
"about weight on a scale, you know we've already
discussed how unreliable a scale is, if your",856.85,5.751
"belly is coming down, reducing, and your fatty
areas in your body is coming down, your insulin",862.601,7.579
level is coming down.,870.18,2.339
It just is.,872.519,1.26
"And, if you're fasting, if you're eating low
carb foods, you are reducing your insulin.",873.779,7.241
"You know, we talked about, in my video Why
Are Fat People Hungry?, we talked about the",881.02,6.91
"relationship between being fat and chronically
high insulin.",887.93,7.17
These things are related.,895.1,1.52
"Now, not for everyone, there are some people
who do not get really fat on the outside,",896.62,6.33
but they get very fat on the inside.,902.95,3.71
"And these people, and I'm talking about fat
around their organs and their liver and around",906.66,4.77
"their organs, they don't appear to be fat
on the outside as much.",911.43,5.11
"But, it's still a relationship between obese,
or fat in that area, general area, and insulin",916.54,8.87
levels.,925.41,1.0
"But, for the most part, if a person is fat
around the middle, and the fatter they are,",926.41,7.119
"more than likely the higher the chronic high
insulin that they have.",933.529,6.531
"And this carries on, you know, a little bit
more.",940.06,4.49
"It�s like a vicious cycle, that builds on
itself over years and years of time.",944.55,6.5
"And, I talked about that a lot in my Fasting
And The Fifty Percent Insulin Problem.",951.05,7.75
"That video dealt with this issue of how this
underlying level of insulin is part of the",958.8,10.479
obesity problem that we have.,969.279,3.74
"There's two people that I admire and I talk
about them on this channel a lot, because",973.019,4.63
"I think they're two scientists that had, really
a big part of the problem in mind.",977.649,7.841
"One was George Cahill, PHd George Cahill,
who really basically settled the question",985.49,7.649
of why human beings do not use fat.,993.139,4.981
"You know, they have to, they have to be in
a state of, a fasted state, in order for their",998.12,7.159
body to switch over and use fat.,1005.279,3.151
"But Dr. Kraft's work shows us, that some people
are always and almost chronically, not almost,",1008.43,10.459
"but they are chronically high in insulin and
they don't know it.",1018.889,4.311
"And you know, if you just prick your finger,
you don't know it.",1023.2,3.34
You don't know what your insulin level is.,1026.54,2.37
"Even if your insulin levels is showing normal
(in the fasted state) you can still have high",1028.91,4.191
insulin.,1033.101,1.039
"Even people on a low carb diet, even people
fasting, even those of you who are losing",1034.14,6.5
"weight right now, listening to and doing what
I'm telling you.",1040.64,4.52
"If you're still pretty fat, if you still have
not lost all your weight, down to where you",1045.16,5.33
need to be.,1050.49,1.64
"You more than likely have higher insulin levels,
all the time, even though they're reducing,",1052.13,7.19
than a normal pattern insulin person.,1059.32,5.43
This is important for you to know.,1064.75,1.74
"That's why you need to continue with this
program and fix this problem, fix it over",1066.49,6.3
time.,1072.79,1.98
Don't stop short with this.,1074.77,3.25
Keep working on it.,1078.02,1.98
"And this is the reason why, if you allow yourself
to eat and munch all the time, and you go",1080.0,5.65
"back into your patterns that you had before,
even low carb, but you're eating a lot (too",1085.65,7.93
"often), you're doing yourself, not very much
good.",1093.58,4.5
"So, guys, listen, this is the most important
thing I want you to get in this video.",1098.08,7.98
"Your insulin levels are different from your
blood sugar.",1106.06,5.28
"To know your insulin levels for sure, you
have to get a test, that Meridian Valley is",1111.34,5.69
a place you might could get that test.,1117.03,3.029
"You could go to a doctor, but really we need
to know what your insulin does after you eat.",1120.059,6.101
"For more on that, you need to watch my video
Why Are Fat People Hungry?",1126.16,6.62
"and that will tell you why it's important
for you to get tested after you have some",1132.78,6.09
"sort of food in your mouth, in your body.",1138.87,4.42
"To see what your insulin does after that,
because there are people who have a fasting",1143.29,4.48
"insulin level that's fairly normal, but after
they eat it goes real high and it stays there",1147.77,7.74
for a long time.,1155.51,1.81
"For the most part though if a someone is heavy,
their fasting insulin level starts creeping",1157.32,4.46
"up, creeping up, creeping up,
Like I told you in my Fasting and the Fifty",1161.78,4.49
"Percent Insulin Problem video, the higher
that fasting insulin level is, the more likely",1166.27,9.519
"it is to spike way high, because on average,
in that study that I used in there, your fasting",1175.789,7.131
"level, your after eating level will probably
jump at least five times higher, than your",1182.92,7.879
fasting insulin level.,1190.799,2.38
"So don't rely on blood sugar as your main
sign that you're doing well.",1193.179,7.11
"It's a good thing to look at, but the reduction
of fat in the fatty areas, that's telling",1200.289,7.781
you if you're knocking that insulin down.,1208.07,2.69
That's what it's going to tell you.,1210.76,1.34
"So if you can't afford the test, but you're
losing weight, as far as your tape measure",1212.1,4.63
is getting a little bit skinnier every time.,1216.73,3.689
Then you're doing yourself some good on that.,1220.419,2.431
"Even without the test,
So, I hope this has helped you.",1222.85,5.449
Remember to write me if you have questions.,1228.299,5.211
"Make sure you go and look at Ivor's interview
with Dr. Kraft.",1233.51,6.7
"And I also have a little short article about
my test and how I took that test, that you",1240.21,8.451
can get on my website.,1248.661,2.619
