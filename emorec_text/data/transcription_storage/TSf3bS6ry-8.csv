hi everybody and welcome back to my,0.06,4.56
channel so as you may have guessed from,2.129,4.431
the title this video is all about the,4.62,5.399
GPP test which I have now had twice,6.56,8.56
Yemi the GTP test is the glucose,10.019,9.031
tolerance test you could be sent for,15.12,6.84
this test by your midwife for so many,19.05,5.91
different reasons reasons it could be,21.96,5.069
because of your BMI it could be because,24.96,4.29
of your medical history it could be,27.029,4.801
because of your family medical history,29.25,4.53
it could be because you are measuring,31.83,4.86
big and there are other reasons as well,33.78,4.59
those are just the ones I can think of,36.69,4.17
off the top of my head the reason I have,38.37,5.7
it the first time is because my BMI was,40.86,5.73
a point nine over what they wanted it to,44.07,5.16
be and so I had to go and have the best,46.59,4.71
done so basically it takes probably,49.23,4.02
about two and a half hours I'd say,51.3,5.13
depending on your hospital or your,53.25,5.039
practice or wherever you go for the test,56.43,5.58
so you go in and you have your first lot,58.289,6.15
of blood taken mine were taken just from,62.01,5.37
here on my arm and these are your,64.439,6.36
fasting blood results because you are,67.38,4.77
not allowed to eat or drink anything,70.799,3.961
other than water for 12 hours before,72.15,5.94
that and even things like toothpaste you,74.76,5.52
have to be so careful make sure that you,78.09,3.54
don't swallow any or anything like that,80.28,3.06
because it can affect the results which,81.63,6.09
would not be good then you are given a,83.34,6.72
glucose drink to drink,87.72,6.06
now some people I have heard say that,90.06,5.64
they were told to take lucozade with,93.78,6.78
them to drink or that their drink tasted,95.7,7.559
like flat dizzy and things like that I,100.56,5.4
have to say my drink tasted like neither,103.259,5.761
of those it literally just tasted gloopy,105.96,7.68
and it just tasted wrong like it,109.02,5.849
shouldn't have been a drink because,113.64,3.299
obviously it was a medical drink and not,114.869,4.651
actual drink and so you have to drink,116.939,3.18
that up,119.52,3.69
preferably quite quickly because then,120.119,5.911
your two hours between the two Burtis is,123.21,4.68
quite sort of like done but your two,126.03,3.72
hour slot will not start until you have,127.89,4.17
finished drinking that drink so down it,129.75,5.67
ladies I managed to drink wine probably,132.06,5.1
in less than a minute because I just,135.42,4.319
thought let's just go for it Blagh Blagh,137.16,3.06
Blagh,139.739,3.841
and drunk it and then it was gone you,140.22,5.67
are still allowed to drink water then,143.58,4.5
and because of a sea you need to hydrate,145.89,4.319
these and things like that you wait two,148.08,4.71
hours and then they take another lot of,150.209,4.291
blood mine that was actually from the,152.79,3.84
same arm because nobody can ever get,154.5,3.66
blood from this arm for some reason and,156.63,3.78
so they take your second lot of blood,158.16,5.43
and they basically see how your body has,160.41,5.909
reacted to the glucose whether it's done,163.59,4.17
what it's supposed to you whether it's,166.319,2.851
struggling and things like where and,167.76,3.03
they do that by checking the levels in,169.17,3.569
your blood after you have done the,170.79,5.6
second blood test if you are lucky I do,172.739,7.11
sort of like use the word lucky and your,176.39,5.5
midwife or whoever is doing the tests,179.849,3.901
may offer you some tea and toast,181.89,4.83
feel free to accept personally I did it,183.75,5.01
because I was in a rush but you know it,186.72,3.629
would have been nice to have have some,188.76,2.88
breakfast because obviously you haven't,190.349,4.021
eaten for like nearly 15 hours by this,191.64,6.569
point so you're poor be hungry and our,194.37,6.63
Hospital tells you to bring up the next,198.209,4.801
day for the results I don't know some,201.0,4.44
other places may give you them quicker,203.01,4.89
or slower it all depends on how they,205.44,6.51
work how their systems work how long it,207.9,6.45
takes for them to do things and then the,211.95,4.89
second time I have to have the test was,214.35,4.44
because my beautiful bump all the way,216.84,4.17
down here which you can't see and was,218.79,6.36
measuring ahead so I went for my 28th,221.01,6.96
week Midwife appointment but my body was,225.15,4.77
measuring as if I was 30 weeks pregnant,227.97,6.09
and then when I went for my 34 weeks,229.92,4.8
pointment,234.06,3.239
I've only was measuring as if I was 37,234.72,4.079
and a half weeks pregnant,237.299,4.111
so if you are measuring big with a four,238.799,5.791
week period like passing and you haven't,241.41,4.889
sort like evened out or caught up or,244.59,3.57
what have you then you will be sent to,246.299,5.401
have the test again and I shouldn't be,248.16,6.449
thanked to have it again now because,251.7,5.25
I've obviously been sent for it they,254.609,3.87
know that I haven't have it and or,256.95,6.51
haven't got it and that I am just,258.479,6.241
measuring big so,263.46,3.03
hopefully anyway if I go central again I,264.72,4.65
think I might cry and however if your,266.49,5.07
results do come back positive then that,269.37,4.43
does mean you have gestational diabetes,271.56,4.44
which is not good,273.8,5.92
really it can be controlled with diet,276.0,7.35
and even medication in some cases to,279.72,5.4
keep you and your baby nice and healthy,283.35,4.13
and safe and growing at the right rate,285.12,4.92
luckily for me I didn't actually find,287.48,4.0
out too much information about that,290.04,3.36
because my results both times came back,291.48,2.49
okay,293.4,3.33
and so if anybody else has had their,293.97,4.23
results come back and they have had it,296.73,2.91
and they have any advice please feel,298.2,2.58
free to leave it in the comments for,299.64,2.64
anybody else that's watching this if,300.78,3.54
they need any advice or they're worried,302.28,3.33
or anything like that it would be really,304.32,2.97
good if you could share your experiences,305.61,4.32
oh yeah basically it's pretty harmless,307.29,4.71
the drink tastes disgusting unless,309.93,4.11
you're lucky it seems and then you're,312.0,5.1
okay and but it just takes a couple of,314.04,5.25
hours and it's over in some ways and you,317.1,4.83
find out whether you do or don't have,319.29,4.5
gestational diabetes and whether you do,321.93,7.02
or don't need to change things and yeah,323.79,8.129
so that was my experience of the GTG,328.95,6.18
test twice and I hope that you enjoyed,331.919,4.5
this video I hope that you found it,335.13,3.15
informative a little helpful if you,336.419,2.821
thought was something that you were,338.28,3.78
looking for don't forget to hit thumbs,339.24,4.86
