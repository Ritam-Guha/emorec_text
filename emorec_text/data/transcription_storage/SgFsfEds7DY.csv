there's a few um,2.48,3.12
key points that i think will be useful,3.84,3.919
in terms of identifying patients earlier,5.6,4.32
in medical practice one is look at,7.759,3.92
patients hands,9.92,4.799
hands that the rings can't get off or a,11.679,4.0
patient that's,14.719,3.601
had to resize their ring over several,15.679,5.36
times in the course of a decade,18.32,4.879
ask for changes in size of feet that,21.039,4.08
will be a signal because usually feet,23.199,3.92
don't really grow in adulthood,25.119,4.08
new spaces between the teeth because of,27.119,3.601
jawed growth,29.199,4.081
is very unusual during adulthood so,30.72,4.4
those are all signs that someone should,33.28,2.56
be tested,35.12,3.04
hand growth foot growth new spaces,35.84,3.92
between teeth and adulthood,38.16,3.36
on top of that i think the biggest thing,39.76,3.36
for primary care doctors or general,41.52,2.64
physicians to remember,43.12,2.0
is that when you start to get a,44.16,3.6
clustering of symptoms that are fairly,45.12,3.84
common but,47.76,4.4
they are all in one patient so you have,48.96,4.16
somebody with maybe,52.16,4.399
earlier onset hypertension diabetes,53.12,4.32
that's getting,56.559,5.121
worse sleep apnea that's a fairly common,57.44,6.0
constellation in patients but when you,61.68,3.439
get all of those things and,63.44,3.039
any of these changes that go with,65.119,3.521
acromegaly you have to think about it,66.479,4.0
not everyone will have the classic look,68.64,3.68
with a large chin and a large nose and,70.479,3.521
the larger brow it can be very subtle,72.32,2.72
facial changes,74.0,3.52
so if you have comorbidities that,75.04,4.32
congregate together,77.52,4.32
early hypertension worsening diabetes,79.36,3.6
sleep apnea,81.84,3.04
you have to think about acromegaly a,82.96,4.0
little bit sooner colonic polyps are,84.88,2.879
also,86.96,2.799
sometimes in the in the list of,87.759,3.36
comorbidities there,89.759,3.201
and i've seen a lot of patients that,91.119,3.521
have all of those and they're coming to,92.96,3.6
me like 10 years later with like,94.64,4.479
very late stage acromegaly and each one,96.56,4.4
of those comorbidities was treated just,99.119,2.801
as its own,100.96,3.519
problem not related to a single source,101.92,4.0
which is the growth hormone,104.479,4.401
excess and the final point in terms of,105.92,4.64
remembering to think about this disease,108.88,2.72
is in women,110.56,2.8
that may look like they have a more,111.6,3.44
common disease which is called,113.36,4.0
polycystic ovarian syndrome where their,115.04,4.0
periods are irregular,117.36,4.0
and they get hair growth and acne maybe,119.04,4.56
they have trouble getting pregnant,121.36,4.32
some of these women with acromegaly have,123.6,3.76
seen fertility doctors,125.68,4.079
been treated with fertility drugs,127.36,4.08
sometimes successfully,129.759,3.84
and the reason for their infertility is,131.44,3.68
actually growth hormone,133.599,5.28
excess which can be a cause of a pcos or,135.12,5.92
polycystic ovarian syndrome,138.879,5.281
like picture so that's that can kind of,141.04,4.64
fake you out and be,144.16,4.719
missed easily the other um,145.68,4.559
the other piece of history that we,148.879,3.761
sometimes get get a chance to see,150.239,4.961
you know retrospectively is that a woman,152.64,3.92
has presented,155.2,3.28
with fertility treatment then went on to,156.56,3.28
get pregnant and had gestational,158.48,2.56
diabetes,159.84,3.2
and that is also common in someone who,161.04,5.36
has growth hormone excess that's,163.04,3.36
uncontrolled,167.72,3.0
