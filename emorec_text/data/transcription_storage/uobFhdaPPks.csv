I am dr. Kenneth coochie chief of the,3.129,5.041
division of endocrinology diabetes and,6.189,4.52
metabolism at the University of Florida,8.17,6.929
at Gainesville the editorial office of,10.709,7.301
the clinical Gastroenterology hepatology,15.099,6.031
asked me to share with you my thoughts,18.01,6.599
on our recent publication on the effects,21.13,6.049
of pioglitazone in patients with nash,24.609,6.021
having or not having type 2 diabetes the,27.179,6.371
background for this study is the,30.63,7.24
publication we had in September 2016 in,33.55,7.529
the annals of internal medicine where we,37.87,5.939
took a group of patients without,41.079,7.021
diabetes and another half with type 2,43.809,6.151
diabetes and we treat him with kind of,48.1,5.279
leaders own for 18 months and we,49.96,6.75
continued open label treatment for,53.379,5.971
another 18 months with biopsies before,56.71,6.18
at 18 months and 36 months the primary,59.35,6.39
endpoint of that study was a change in,62.89,6.36
two or more and the NAP of the activity,65.74,7.83
score without a worsening of fibrosis in,69.25,7.17
that study about two-thirds of patients,73.57,6.509
reached the primary endpoint and 65% of,76.42,6.93
those on pioglitazone compared to about,80.079,8.341
20% on placebo which resolution imagine,83.35,7.47
now the question that we have since then,88.42,5.61
do patient with diabetes behave or,90.82,5.82
respond better to pioglitazone compared,94.03,5.339
to those without diabetes in our studies,96.64,5.13
they had pre-diabetes the only evidence,99.369,5.401
we had in pre-diabetes was from payments,101.77,4.889
that only study patients without,104.77,5.639
diabetes however from this study and an,106.659,6.541
earlier study by my lab with dr. Bell,110.409,5.701
for published in 2006 in the New England,113.2,5.879
we pulled this data to try to get an,116.11,7.109
answer so what we did in the study was,119.079,6.241
in addition to liver biopsies we did a,123.219,4.161
number of measures of liver fat by,125.32,3.52
magnetic,127.38,5.279
spectroscopy and insulin sensitivity,128.84,6.22
studies called insulin plants to look at,132.659,4.92
the effect of treatment in these,135.06,5.519
patients what did we find,137.579,6.511
well the primary endpoint and resolution,140.579,5.101
of Nass was achieved,144.09,3.42
similarly in patients without diabetes,145.68,4.8
but with pre-diabetes compared to those,147.51,6.96
with type 2 diabetes the liver fat,150.48,7.379
changes were the same muscle and liver,154.47,5.189
insulin sensitivity were not all that,157.859,3.99
different and improved pretty much to,159.659,4.11
the levels of an obese individual,161.849,5.28
without a fatty liver but we saw two,163.769,6.39
major differences number one adipose,167.129,5.19
tissue insulin sensitivity we proved,170.159,5.061
more in patients with type 2 diabetes an,172.319,6.42
indication that the drug has a primary,175.22,6.549
target and adipose tissue which is very,178.739,4.761
important in the pathogenesis of,181.769,4.65
Nathalie has the high levels of free,183.5,4.769
fatty acid refluxing to the liver,186.419,4.891
promotes 10 ptosis and cause the lipo,188.269,6.64
toxicity insult and second most,191.31,5.849
importantly we saw a significant,194.909,4.29
difference in the progression to,197.159,4.531
fibrosis when patients with type 2,199.199,6.481
diabetes are treated with Pietism the,201.69,6.12
bottom line is the take-home message is,205.68,5.61
that because patients with type 2,207.81,6.75
diabetes progress more rapidly and did,211.29,6.77
worse after 18 months if on placebo,214.56,5.97
treatment with pioglitazone offered them,218.06,5.98
a greater protection so the take-home,220.53,5.629
message for the clinician is that,224.04,4.71
particularly target treatment to those,226.159,4.48
patient with type 2 diabetes as,228.75,4.709
pioglitazone which is now a generic that,230.639,5.78
cost less than 15 dollars a month is,233.459,6.331
safe and the medication was well,236.419,5.68
tolerated by the vast majority of,239.79,4.81
patients so thank you,242.099,4.961
and hopefully this will be useful for,244.6,5.45
your clinical practice,247.06,2.99
