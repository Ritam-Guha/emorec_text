hey it's me Angela I'm here to talk to,0.0,5.25
you today about something that a lot of,2.909,5.491
people either ask me right away or later,5.25,5.49
tell me that they wanted to ask but,8.4,3.96
didn't really know how to bring it up,10.74,4.92
initially which is what has been the,12.36,5.7
hardest part about this surgery and I,15.66,4.98
was thinking about it and instantly I,18.06,4.59
thought about changing my routines,20.64,4.309
learning how to eat differently,22.65,4.92
exercising learning to relate to people,24.949,5.111
a little bit differently but then I was,27.57,5.16
talking to my oldest daughter and she,30.06,4.409
brought up a really good question she,32.73,3.9
told me mom I don't think that anybody's,34.469,3.631
gonna really want to watch your videos,36.63,3.57
unless they can understand why you,38.1,3.75
wanted to have the surgery in the first,40.2,4.08
place like I really don't care what you,41.85,4.529
have to say unless I know why I'm not,44.28,4.29
saying that y'all feel that way but she,46.379,4.141
brought up a really good point and it,48.57,4.919
made me realize that the hardest part,50.52,5.519
about having this surgery like God's,53.489,5.131
honest truth was signing up for the,56.039,4.831
classes that I needed to take to get the,58.62,5.64
surgery I was heartbroken when I,60.87,7.41
realized that I am actually a candidate,64.26,6.87
for bariatric surgery like what does,68.28,5.28
that mean for my life how heavy have I,71.13,5.22
let myself get how out of shape am i why,73.56,5.01
did I do this to myself what am i doing,76.35,4.559
why haven't I stopped like what the heck,78.57,4.86
is happening that I actually qualify for,80.909,5.191
bariatric surgery that blew my mind and,83.43,4.74
I don't mean this to come off wrong at,86.1,4.409
all but it's not something that you ever,88.17,4.08
really think that you're gonna go,90.509,3.271
through in your life and at the time,92.25,3.479
when I looked in the mirror like I knew,93.78,4.29
I was heavy but I didn't feel like I was,95.729,5.64
bariatric surgery heavy but clearly I,98.07,6.63
was going to those classes and spending,101.369,5.761
the six months in those classes coming,104.7,5.16
to terms with the emotional reasons that,107.13,5.099
were tied to my eating habits that was,109.86,5.16
tough it's still hard now because I'm,112.229,5.811
constantly grappling with my emotional,115.02,5.669
relationship with food and it's changed,118.04,4.78
so much and I find myself wanting to,120.689,4.651
like go back and beat my old self up for,122.82,5.07
getting to where I got and I'm not going,125.34,3.75
to do that in order to have the,127.89,3.82
bariatric surgery at the time that I,129.09,4.84
through the program with my insurance,131.71,5.25
provider we had to take six months of,133.93,5.1
health classes where you learn about,136.96,5.16
nutrition eating habits you explore your,139.03,5.52
relationship with food and you learn all,142.12,4.89
about the surgery itself the risks of,144.55,5.16
surgery and how to get by,147.01,5.13
after surgery so it was really,149.71,4.11
educational some weeks were more,152.14,3.21
interesting than others it was a once a,153.82,3.27
week class I made some really good,155.35,3.63
friends in that class who we just got,157.09,3.93
really close and we connected and,158.98,3.87
clicked and we've been able to support,161.02,4.11
each other since having the surgery and,162.85,4.2
we check in on each other so I really do,165.13,4.8
value that when I think about what has,167.05,5.94
been the hardest part about having the,169.93,5.07
surgery it was deciding to have it in,172.99,4.26
the first place it was really coming to,175.0,5.55
terms with where I am physically and and,177.25,5.67
what I had done to my body to answer my,180.55,4.8
daughter's question which is why did I,182.92,4.29
have the surgery that was tough -,185.35,5.01
because I didn't have as serious of,187.21,5.49
problems as some of the other people did,190.36,5.07
who I know have had the surgery but I,192.7,5.7
thought to myself self you're working so,195.43,6.57
hard at an institution where you're,198.4,6.27
earning a great pension and at the same,202.0,5.16
time you aren't eating and killing,204.67,4.65
yourself so what's the point of working,207.16,4.44
so hard for a retirement that you may,209.32,5.55
never get to get to or you may never get,211.6,5.4
to enjoy because you'll be obese and,214.87,4.11
you're not gonna be able to do anything,217.0,4.02
I had the surgery for my own future I,218.98,4.56
had it for the future of my children for,221.02,4.71
the future of my marriage the future of,223.54,4.83
whatever it is that God has had in store,225.73,4.71
for me all of this time it was an,228.37,5.01
investment and it totally freaked me out,230.44,5.67
and it totally offended me that I,233.38,5.79
qualified for this I just felt like whoa,236.11,4.98
I can't believe that I've gotten to this,239.17,4.26
place but then I quickly let that go and,241.09,5.04
I decided I'm here I want better I can,243.43,4.62
do better I've got this great health,246.13,3.96
insurance that is going to help me get,248.05,3.69
this weight off so I can make better,250.09,4.08
choices and that's what I did and you,251.74,4.89
know what I do not regret it as hard as,254.17,5.819
it was to hear the truth about where I,256.63,5.789
was physically it was so worth it and,259.989,4.231
I'd do it all over again I,262.419,4.621
have no regrets about having this,264.22,5.07
surgery so if it's something you're,267.04,4.74
thinking about having or one of your,269.29,4.86
loved ones is having the surgery yeah it,271.78,4.56
is totally a nerve-wracking thing it's,274.15,5.13
very emotional and there's a lot of,276.34,4.29
physical changes that are gonna happen,279.28,3.72
and a lot of relationship changes that,280.63,4.26
are going to occur as a result of,283.0,4.41
changing this person's relationship with,284.89,5.1
food but if you have any questions about,287.41,4.71
the surgery or about my decision to do,289.99,3.78
