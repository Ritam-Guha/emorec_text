acromegaly,4.279,5.32
is thought of as a rare disease,5.52,7.119
with very specific,9.599,6.561
characteristic manifestations,12.639,7.121
these manifestations can include changes,16.16,5.279
in the way the patients look,19.76,5.839
so coarsening of their features,21.439,6.801
increased in the size of the tongue,25.599,3.121
teeth,28.24,3.76
shifting and enlargement of the hands,28.72,3.679
and,32.0,2.96
feet which is what we call acronym,32.399,4.801
enlargement,34.96,5.439
the problem was looking at acromegaly,37.2,7.08
in this fashion as a disease with,40.399,6.961
pathognomonic features is that,44.28,6.439
these features develop slowly over the,47.36,5.359
course of years,50.719,5.601
which tends to delay the diagnosis,52.719,6.64
by more than five years,56.32,6.32
in the past it was actually more than,59.359,6.8
10 years that a patient would experience,62.64,7.28
in terms of a delay from when the first,66.159,6.401
manifestations occurred,69.92,6.8
until the the correct diagnosis was made,72.56,7.04
i think the recent literature shows some,76.72,3.84
progress,79.6,4.159
that there is a delay that um of,80.56,6.8
only about five or ten years but this,83.759,6.641
i think anyone would agree that is still,87.36,6.16
a very long time so the problem with,90.4,4.48
having a,93.52,3.76
delay between manifestations and,94.88,3.36
diagnosis,97.28,4.08
is that chronic exposure with high,98.24,4.0
growth to grow,101.36,3.039
high growth hormone levels would,102.24,3.6
actually,104.399,5.121
cause comorbidities complications,105.84,7.04
things like cardiovascular,109.52,5.68
changes from high blood pressure to,112.88,4.279
heart problems,115.2,5.919
hyperglycemia changes in,117.159,7.32
the bones and during this time the tumor,121.119,5.201
has time to grow,124.479,5.84
and become more invasive,126.32,6.16
and more difficult to remove in its,130.319,4.0
entirety,132.48,5.68
by the neurosurgeon so,134.319,6.961
in my practice as a as a,138.16,6.56
pituitary specialist of more than,141.28,7.599
20 years i have started to,144.72,8.799
think and to educate people,148.879,7.841
in a different fashion we shouldn't be,153.519,3.921
waiting,156.72,3.519
until anyone is able to make this,157.44,4.4
diagnosis,160.239,5.041
we should instead look for a cluster,161.84,7.28
of characteristic manifestations,165.28,7.28
such as increased sweating carpal tunnel,169.12,4.479
syndrome,172.56,3.759
and that may be in conjunction with um,173.599,4.56
other things that are actually,176.319,4.801
common in the general population such as,178.159,4.481
hypertension,181.12,5.92
or joint pain or hypoglycemia,182.64,7.76
i think if we look at a combination,187.04,7.04
of suggestive manifestations and,190.4,6.64
symptoms we would make the diagnosis,194.08,4.159
sooner,197.04,4.0
and with this bring the patient to the,198.239,4.321
correct,201.04,4.08
to the to the correct physician and have,202.56,4.48
the correct treatment,205.12,8.0
um sooner than before,207.04,8.16
you,213.12,2.08
