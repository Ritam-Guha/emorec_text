"Hello, hi and welcome",2.313,0.833
"to Fact of the Day with me, Mark Lotsu.",3.146,1.854
"Diabetes and migraines,
an unlikely combination.",5.0,3.44
"In the 1970s, there was a suggested link",8.44,2.82
between diabetes and migraines.,11.26,1.88
It was simple.,13.14,0.833
"If you had diabetes, you were less likely",13.973,2.767
to develop migraines.,16.74,1.42
"Diabetes is a lifelong
condition that results",18.16,2.3
"in your blood glucose
levels becoming too high.",20.46,2.4
Glucose is sugar.,22.86,1.31
"And it affects approximately
3.6 million people",24.17,2.68
in the UK alone.,26.85,1.31
There are two types:,28.16,0.89
"Type one diabetes is where
your body's own immune system",29.05,2.67
"attack and destroy the
insulin producing cells.",31.72,3.25
"The insulin is a hormone
that's used to reduce",34.97,2.32
your blood glucose levels.,37.29,1.72
"Type two is where your
body either doesn't produce",39.01,2.11
"enough insulin or your
body cells don't respond",41.12,2.96
to the insulin that's produced.,44.08,1.55
"In both circumstances, it
means your blood glucose levels",45.63,2.65
"are not reduced, and
that is life threatening.",48.28,2.09
A migraine is a reoccurring headache,50.37,1.86
that feels like a severe throbbing pain,52.23,1.98
on one side of your head.,54.21,1.11
"Symptoms also include nausea, vomiting,",55.32,2.42
"and an increase in
sensitivity to light or sound.",57.74,2.5
"It affects approximately
one out of five women",60.24,1.692
and one out of 15 men.,61.932,1.838
Now today's fact is based on work done,63.77,1.94
by Ippazio Antonazzo and his colleagues,65.71,2.8
at the University of Bergen in Norway.,68.51,2.19
"So they looked at a drug
prescription records",70.7,2.152
"of all the adults under
the age of 80 in Norway",72.852,3.878
over a ten year period.,76.73,1.69
"So, there were 4.2 million
people in the study.",78.42,3.84
"Of these, 8,000 had been
treated for type one diabetes,",82.26,3.16
"and 93,000 people were being
treated for type two diabetes.",85.42,3.96
"Then they looked at
what proportion of these",89.38,1.89
then went on to get migraine medication,91.27,2.394
compared to non-diabetics.,93.664,2.456
Their finding?,96.12,0.833
"People with diabetes are less
likely to develop migraine.",96.953,3.477
What they don't know yet is it the disease,100.43,1.95
or the medication that was reducing,102.38,1.72
the occurrence of migraines.,104.1,1.26
"So, one of the side effects of diabetes",105.36,1.78
"is nerve ending damage,
which causes a reduction",107.14,2.296
in sensation in your hands and feet.,109.436,2.434
"And it's thought this may
also affect your head,",111.87,2.248
therefore reducing your ability,114.118,2.372
to actually sense the migraines.,116.49,1.91
Or the link could be genetic.,118.4,1.73
"In some people with migraines,
they have a mutation",120.13,2.35
"in the gene that causes
the production of a protein",122.48,2.83
that is sensitive to the hormone insulin.,125.31,2.62
"So people who have this
mutation could be developing",127.93,2.5
"migraines as a result of
abnormal insulin levels.",130.43,3.61
"So, diabetics who are
treating their diabetes",134.04,2.346
"by normalising their insulin
levels would also reduce",136.386,3.613
the occurrence of migraines.,139.999,1.911
So what is the end result?,141.91,1.09
The end result is more testing is needed.,143.0,1.86
Should we change the diabetes medication?,144.86,1.8
"Can a variant of it which doesn't
affect your insulin levels",146.66,3.32
be given to people with migraines?,149.98,1.53
"One that doesn't affect
your blood glucose levels",151.51,2.04
but reduces the occurrence of migraines.,153.55,1.94
"If you have diabetes and migraines,",155.49,1.52
please leave a comment below.,157.01,1.21
"That is, diabetes and migraines
are an unlikely combination.",158.22,3.11
