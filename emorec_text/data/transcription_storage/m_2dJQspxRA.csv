good morning today we will be learning,1.62,5.439
about what is hemoglobin a1c which is a,4.09,5.82
diabetes test so you have diabetes you,7.059,5.041
go to a doctor or you have your dad,9.91,3.96
grandmom you take them to the doctor and,12.1,2.97
the doctors like what have you been,13.87,3.419
doing your a1c is way out of control,15.07,4.23
your diabetes is way out of control,17.289,4.201
and you're like oh my god the past two,19.3,3.6
weeks have been following a strict,21.49,3.66
diabetic diet and my sugars are all have,22.9,4.08
been perfect then why's the doctor,25.15,3.99
saying my diabetes is out of control,26.98,3.93
so to understand that let's know what,29.14,6.21
the hemoglobin a1c is so we all have,30.91,6.21
little cells called red blood cells in,35.35,3.479
our body which contain a substance,37.12,4.379
called hemoglobin the work of this,38.829,4.5
hemoglobin is when you breathe in oxygen,41.499,4.261
to attach to the oxygen and take oxygen,43.329,5.46
to different cells and supply oxygen to,45.76,6.419
different cells so as our brain cells,48.789,6.62
the red blood cells also thrive on,52.179,6.81
glucose so the only form of energy for,55.409,6.011
your red blood cells as blood glucose so,58.989,4.56
whenever there's glucose in the blood,61.42,4.56
the RBC kind of is exposed to it or,63.549,5.161
takes a part of it and kind of stores in,65.98,5.37
it because that's its form of energy and,68.71,6.27
the RBC or your red blood cell lives 90,71.35,6.48
days or three months so when we do the,74.98,5.76
hemoglobin a1c test we are checking the,77.83,6.36
glucose in the RBC so that will give us,80.74,6.45
a range of how your blood sugar has been,84.19,6.53
in the past three months rather than an,87.19,6.03
instantaneous value which is your blood,90.72,5.29
glucose so to give an example this is,93.22,5.4
like instead of asking you like what is,96.01,4.47
your fasting blood sugar yesterday or,98.62,3.6
what did you have for dinner that's kind,100.48,4.11
of like an instantaneous value but,102.22,4.439
instead of that asking someone who has,104.59,3.66
been with you over the past three months,106.659,3.691
like your spouse or someone else and,108.25,4.77
have been silently watching you munch,110.35,4.74
all these sugary stuff and kind of,113.02,4.889
making a note and asking them about how,115.09,4.74
your diabetic diet has been over the,117.909,3.721
past three months so kind of think like,119.83,4.29
your red blood cell is the silent,121.63,3.9
spectator in your blood,124.12,3.45
who's been watching your blood glucose,125.53,5.519
trends even when you are not realizing,127.57,5.64
and that's what we are checking to kind,131.049,4.891
you know how your blood sugar range has,133.21,5.13
been over the past three months rather,135.94,7.26
than one instantaneous value so to give,138.34,6.06
you some noms,143.2,3.48
a normal hemoglobin a1c is somewhere,144.4,4.59
between like four and five point six,146.68,4.5
when you're in the five point seven to,148.99,5.07
six point four range you are a,151.18,5.07
pre-diabetic meaning you have a very,154.06,4.62
high risk of developing diabetes and,156.25,5.34
when you're over six point five or,158.68,5.34
higher then you are actually a diabetic,161.59,5.28
and when you have diabetes we'll have,164.02,6.09
targets for the a1c meaning it depends,166.87,5.88
mostly on your age and your other risk,170.11,5.07
factors but predominantly we try to,172.75,4.23
reach a goal of seven to seven point,175.18,4.89
five or lower and that kind of gives a,176.98,6.33
good diabetes control so here is a chart,180.07,8.13
where it shows like the range of blood,183.31,7.83
sugar over three months and expected a1c,188.2,5.55
values meaning if your Sugar's have been,191.14,4.92
in the 150s this is your a1c if your,193.75,4.02
sugars have predominantly been in the,196.06,4.8
260s this is your a1c so that's where,197.77,5.1
this test is a really valuable test,200.86,3.66
because it kind of gives a range rather,202.87,4.29
than an instantaneous value but are two,204.52,4.02
things that I would like to discuss,207.16,3.99
which can affect your hemoglobin a1c so,208.54,5.76
one is like if you're binging at times,211.15,5.13
like during festival days during,214.3,4.02
holidays and then you're just fasting,216.28,3.51
before coming to your doctor your,218.32,2.88
fasting blood Sugar's over two weeks,219.79,3.81
might be perfect but your a1c is still,221.2,3.99
going to be high because of all those,223.6,3.9
binge days when you're silent spectator,225.19,4.62
has been watching you and the other,227.5,5.94
thing is if you're maybe like having,229.81,7.08
really light meals for breakfast and,233.44,5.19
lunch and you're just checking your,236.89,3.51
blood Sugar's then and then you're,238.63,3.69
binging your dinner and you're not,240.4,3.81
checking your blood sugar then again,242.32,3.96
your silent spectator is watching and,244.21,4.56
when we check your a1c we are going to,246.28,6.06
know about that so that's why this test,248.77,6.36
is important and it really helps in the,252.34,5.1
management of diabetic patients thank,255.13,4.46
you,257.44,2.15
