fasting blood sugar levels are measured,0.03,3.99
by taking a blood test during a period,2.25,4.2
of fasting usually of around 8 hours,4.02,5.28
without food typically blood glucose,6.45,4.56
levels are measured in the morning,9.3,3.99
before any breakfast is eaten when,11.01,3.839
having your blood glucose levels,13.29,3.3
measured you should make sure you don't,14.849,3.571
drink anything apart from water during,16.59,5.88
the period of fasting a fasting blood,18.42,6.21
glucose test can be useful to see how,22.47,3.899
well the body can manage blood sugar,24.63,4.38
levels in the absence of food when we do,26.369,4.381
not eat for several hours the body,29.01,3.51
should release glucose into the blood,30.75,3.87
via the liver and in response to this,32.52,4.11
the body should produce insulin to,34.62,6.15
stabilize blood sugar levels a fasting,36.63,6.14
blood glucose test therefore shows,40.77,4.5
whether the body is able to bring down,42.77,4.539
the blood glucose levels present from,45.27,4.559
the previous meal how effectively the,47.309,4.171
body copes with its own production of,49.829,4.591
glucose the targets for fasting blood,51.48,4.919
glucose levels are the same as the,54.42,4.77
targets for before meal readings for,56.399,5.101
adults with diabetes the target levels,59.19,4.439
are between 4 and 7 millimoles per liter,61.5,5.04
for children with diabetes the target,63.629,4.861
levels are between 4 and 8 millimoles,66.54,4.59
per liter however some people may be,68.49,5.4
given individual targets by their doctor,71.13,7.29
that differ to these fasting blood,73.89,6.36
glucose tests for people with type 2,78.42,4.199
diabetes are useful for showing how well,80.25,4.38
your body's insulin responds to periods,82.619,5.011
without food such as overnight in type 1,84.63,3.629
diabetes,87.63,3.09
fasting blood glucose tests help to show,88.259,4.11
whether your long-term insulin or,90.72,3.48
background insulin as it's sometimes,92.369,3.901
known is set to the right levels if,94.2,4.11
you're in any doubt your healthcare team,96.27,3.599
