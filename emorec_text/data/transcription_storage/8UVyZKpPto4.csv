okay one of the things that you'll hear,0.03,3.99
a lot about if you have a diagnosis of,2.04,5.19
diabetes there's two words hyper which,4.02,7.079
is high and hypo which is low glycaemia,7.23,5.55
glycaemia is just to do with your blood,11.099,4.441
sugar level I'll probably use a lot of,12.78,5.19
hand gestures like this because high is,15.54,4.11
high and low is low and you want to,17.97,3.149
actually try and find the balance in the,19.65,3.45
middle where you're safe and functional,21.119,4.67
everything's working well now,23.1,6.63
hypoglycemia think Oh hypo is low is,25.789,7.18
when you've got either too much insulin,29.73,7.95
or too little sugar typically most,32.969,8.16
people feel symptoms it's pretty much an,37.68,6.51
insulin overdose but because it's part,41.129,4.711
of the rest of your body there's other,44.19,4.11
bits going on as well because your body,45.84,5.789
is basically reacting to a threat you,48.3,4.71
might get a bit of adrenaline being,51.629,3.691
kicked out as well so some of the,53.01,3.689
symptoms you can even put down to,55.32,2.61
adrenaline as opposed to just the,56.699,3.0
insulin overdose but what you will feel,57.93,6.479
probably is shaky a bit confused a,59.699,7.71
little bit uncoordinated some people get,64.409,6.03
a bit sweaty some people see how they,67.409,4.89
can see their their eyes go a bit funny,70.439,3.421
they can usually tell they'll be looking,72.299,3.031
at something I think that oh you know I,73.86,4.049
can notice it it's not quite right now,75.33,5.94
the best thing possible is if you keep,77.909,4.951
your blood testing kit with you is to do,81.27,4.01
a blood test to be certain that you have,82.86,6.06
found yourself going into hypo there's,85.28,5.14
just a chance that you could be,88.92,4.32
confusing it a hypo could be confused,90.42,4.5
with feeling very nervous about,93.24,3.69
something for example again it's that,94.92,5.87
similar feeling of adrenaline kicking in,96.93,6.21
having said that when you're having a,100.79,4.39
hypo doing a blood test can be rather,103.14,4.74
tricky if that's I usually know if I'm,105.18,4.71
having a hypo because I'm trying to do,107.88,2.97
all this you're trying to get the,109.89,2.25
strip's in and if you sort of end up,110.85,2.82
throwing the thing away,112.14,4.17
and hitting a wall it's because you're,113.67,6.299
just losing it the other factor with,116.31,5.94
adrenaline and insulin is you can get,119.969,5.671
very short-tempered and snappy and that,122.25,6.27
can be another sign it's important that,125.64,5.28
you can learn to recognize your symptoms,128.52,2.91
and,130.92,2.84
importance really that you can keep,131.43,5.46
having your symptoms if you spend an,133.76,4.929
awful lot of time having hypose you,136.89,3.06
might actually start losing your,138.689,4.05
sensitivity to those symptoms and one of,139.95,4.23
the other things that's really helpful,142.739,4.051
is for the people around you do them a,144.18,4.35
favor let them know that you have,146.79,3.72
diabetes and that if certain things,148.53,5.579
start to happen they can be part of the,150.51,6.3
help to get you out of your hypo all,154.109,4.291
you'll really need is some sugar in,156.81,5.64
whatever form possible liquids sometimes,158.4,5.97
easier than having to chew if you're,162.45,5.789
having a bad hypo bad anything under,164.37,5.369
when you do a blood test anything under,168.239,5.041
four would be very very borderline but,169.739,4.62
by the time you're three point eight,173.28,2.689
you're definitely having a hypo and,174.359,4.05
effectively the lower you go the more,175.969,4.24
sugar you're going to get a need to pull,178.409,3.78
yourself up and it also might make a bit,180.209,6.18
more time to come back up so you want,182.189,5.7
you want to address the hype as soon as,186.389,4.05
you can once you've had diabetes quite a,187.889,3.78
long time and you've had quite a lot,190.439,3.901
hypose I mean they are inevitable you,191.669,5.91
will get them the real issue is to try,194.34,4.92
not to have too many and when you do,197.579,3.63
have them try not to have any major ones,199.26,5.369
and to always be prepared and have some,201.209,5.941
sugar handy the people around you might,204.629,4.92
be able to say you know you're acting a,207.15,4.619
bit funny or you're looking a bit shaky,209.549,4.47
and that those can be the people that,211.769,4.021
help to tell you if you're going a bit,214.019,3.33
wobbly if you're not picking picking up,215.79,3.75
the symptoms yourself obviously I've,217.349,3.45
been using the phrase feeling a bit,219.54,3.93
wobbly it's very commonly used so not,220.799,4.351
everyone says I'm feeling hypo or I'm,223.47,4.019
going into hypo and I don't know any,225.15,4.859
want to use this hyperglycemia wobbly,227.489,6.06
dizzy we all have our own ways of,230.009,6.72
describing it but try not to overdo it,233.549,6.66
when you have a hypo your body once your,236.729,5.311
body is recovered and getting into sort,240.209,4.53
of recovery situation it too will start,242.04,5.039
kicking out sugars so you don't need to,244.739,4.68
overdo it your main thing you need is to,247.079,4.141
try and keep your head if you can and,249.419,4.68
sit down and take some time it should,251.22,5.699
take about 15-20 minutes to adjust your,254.099,5.01
sugar levels at or at least pull you,256.919,4.85
away from a hypo,259.109,4.43
if you could you certainly need to be,261.769,3.661
very careful if you're driving you,263.539,3.81
should have tested before you drive to,265.43,3.54
avoid the possibility of having a hypo,267.349,4.981
but if you happen to be driving you,268.97,4.47
shouldn't really be blood testing at the,272.33,2.76
wheel and should pull over and do a,273.44,3.379
blood test and if you are having a hypo,275.09,5.579
treat it and wait at least 15 minutes,276.819,5.41
you should wait until your Sugar's up to,280.669,4.291
at least 5 again as far as treating it,282.229,5.37
as concerns you can keep things that,284.96,6.45
either don't go off don't melt you know,287.599,6.451
and are just available they can be in,291.41,5.129
your bag they can be in a desk school,294.05,4.47
desk an office desk can be in a glove,296.539,3.961
compartment and the only thing you have,298.52,4.049
to remember to do is if you use one when,300.5,4.889
you're having a hypo replace it so that,302.569,6.621
next time you need one there is one bare,305.389,3.801
