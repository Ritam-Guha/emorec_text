could covert 19 trigger diabetes,0.24,4.48
like we needed it but proof that the,3.04,3.92
freestyle libra works,4.72,5.44
and could a cure be around the corner,6.96,10.96
that's all coming up in today's video,10.16,7.76
hello my name's jamie lowe and news,20.24,3.92
about that cure coming up in just a,22.08,4.08
second but first emerging evidence,24.16,3.84
suggests that covid19,26.16,4.4
could trigger diabetes in some people,28.0,4.399
but scientists don't know yet if these,30.56,4.48
cases represent type 1 diabetes,32.399,5.761
type 2 diabetes or a new form,35.04,5.039
scientists have long suspected viral,38.16,3.68
infections could play a role in,40.079,4.16
triggering some type 1 diabetes at least,41.84,5.039
in some people but now the new england,44.239,4.32
journal of medicine has published the,46.879,2.241
emerging,48.559,2.561
observations of a team of 17,49.12,3.759
international researchers exploring,51.12,2.32
links,52.879,3.441
between covert 19 patients and diabetes,53.44,5.439
francesco rubino a researcher on one of,56.32,3.52
the projects,58.879,2.881
said diabetes is one of the most,59.84,3.6
prevalent chronic diseases,61.76,3.439
and we are now realizing the,63.44,4.24
consequences of the inevitable clash,65.199,5.441
between two pandemics the freestyle,67.68,3.759
libra system,70.64,3.36
significantly improves glycemic control,71.439,5.04
and hypoglycemic awareness according to,74.0,4.08
the abdc's first,76.479,4.081
national audit into the technology now i,78.08,4.0
don't think this is coming as a surprise,80.56,2.559
to anyone really,82.08,3.359
i have been using the freestyle libra,83.119,3.761
for,85.439,3.121
i think a couple of years now i can't,86.88,3.12
even remember when i got it i think i,88.56,3.28
got it around the same time as i got my,90.0,2.799
pump so,91.84,5.2
approximately two years and i do,92.799,6.401
and i'm exposing myself here probably,97.04,4.48
about five fingerprint tests,99.2,4.64
in a year i do very very little it's,101.52,3.76
completely changed,103.84,3.52
my relationship with diabetes and my,105.28,3.68
ability to do things with,107.36,4.079
diabetes but these findings were,108.96,4.799
scientific not based on the analogous,111.439,4.161
observations that i've just shared with,113.759,3.121
you and they were based on,115.6,3.76
data from more than 10 000 freestyle,116.88,3.76
libra system users,119.36,4.799
from across 102 nhs hospitals in the uk,120.64,5.519
now the authors also found that the,124.159,4.401
system reduces diabetes distress,126.159,4.641
and hospital emissions while also,128.56,3.039
improving,130.8,4.64
hba1c levels abcd who carried out the,131.599,4.321
research,135.44,2.24
said that so far there had been no,135.92,3.679
comprehensive real world large,137.68,3.919
population based datasets,139.599,4.401
looking at the impact of freestyle libra,141.599,3.201
on multiple,144.0,3.28
aspects of diabetes care the freestyle,144.8,3.439
libra system,147.28,4.16
was made available on the nhs in 2017 to,148.239,4.64
people with type 1 diabetes,151.44,4.56
who use insulin so i mean most of us,152.879,4.481
then and if you're struggling to get,156.0,2.08
your hands,157.36,2.879
on a freestyle libra do get in touch,158.08,4.0
with the charities diabetes uk,160.239,4.961
and jdrf can help you get your hands,162.08,5.28
on the freestyle libra system trust me,165.2,3.92
it'll change your life,167.36,3.36
now let's talk about that type 1,169.12,4.32
diabetes cure and an israeli company is,170.72,4.64
claiming to have created a micro,173.44,2.72
pancreas,175.36,3.04
that can cure diabetes and they've said,176.16,4.32
they'll submit a request next month,178.4,5.68
for human clinical trials in the uk,180.48,5.28
betalin therapeutic said its,184.08,4.079
bioartificial pancreas aims to free,185.76,4.24
patients of the need for insulin,188.159,4.0
injections and blood sugar monitoring,190.0,3.76
it's designed for people with type 1,192.159,4.0
diabetes and those with type 2 diabetes,193.76,5.44
who require insulin the jerusalem-based,196.159,3.44
firm,199.2,2.319
told the guardian it would provide a,199.599,4.0
plan for clinical trials to britain's,201.519,4.72
regulatory agency in august,203.599,5.041
vetlin aims to begin human testing early,206.239,3.28
next year,208.64,3.72
with the hope of delivering to market by,209.519,4.08
2024,212.36,2.76
central to the innovation is a,213.599,3.28
biological scaffold,215.12,4.8
adapted from pig lung tissue that holds,216.879,4.161
beta cells,219.92,3.2
those cells release insulin based on the,221.04,3.759
patient's blood sugar levels,223.12,3.839
the miniature artificial pancreas just,224.799,3.841
about visible to the naked eye is,226.959,2.481
implanted,228.64,3.519
under the skin on the thigh using local,229.44,3.68
anesthetic,232.159,2.561
the trials are planned in several,233.12,3.679
hospitals affiliated with the leads at,234.72,4.159
newcastle universities with omar,236.799,4.481
masood a uk transplant surgeon with,238.879,3.681
experience in combating,241.28,4.8
diabetes who is directing the project so,242.56,5.2
i mean they do keep saying a cure is,246.08,3.28
five years away so maybe,247.76,3.52
now it's just four but let me know what,249.36,3.28
you think about that,251.28,4.48
tiny micro artificial pancreas in,252.64,5.119
