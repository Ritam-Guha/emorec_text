so I wanted to create a video on this,0.03,3.96
situation that can occur where you have,1.65,5.37
slightly higher blood glucose but you're,3.99,6.06
still in ketosis okay because normally,7.02,4.59
the way it works is you have high sugar,10.05,4.589
and low ketones haikyuu tones and low,11.61,5.37
sugar but what happens sometimes is your,14.639,4.051
blood glucose might go up but you're,16.98,4.379
still in ketosis so why does that happen,18.69,3.78
but before I tell you that let me just,21.359,2.781
get into why you might have high sugar,22.47,3.719
doing keto okay,24.14,4.35
excessive protein for dinner tonight,26.189,5.701
could create a spike in blood sugar the,28.49,5.74
next day okay that's one thing so make,31.89,3.66
sure you have a moderate amount of,34.23,4.5
protein the two car back reap you start,35.55,6.24
adding more carbs unknowingly and when,38.73,4.47
you have to kind of look at them and,41.79,3.42
reevaluate you're like wow I'm doing too,43.2,3.78
many carbohydrates so that could be a,45.21,4.169
situation and then frequent meal so,46.98,3.66
you're doing too many snacks,49.379,5.221
that'll do it or your cortisol is too,50.64,6.329
high so when people go through stress,54.6,4.02
okay they're gonna have higher levels of,56.969,3.93
cortisol the peak time of cortisol,58.62,3.869
happens about 8 o'clock in the morning,60.899,4.44
so if you're actually checking your,62.489,5.431
blood glucose in the morning at 8,65.339,4.35
o'clock and find that it's pretty high,67.92,4.68
it could be from the cortisol that is,69.689,4.561
being spiked because your body's going,72.6,2.85
through some stress or something but,74.25,3.479
typically for everyone it'll be slightly,75.45,3.959
higher it shouldn't be that much but it,77.729,3.271
would be slightly higher nothing to,79.409,4.64
worry about but just make note of that,81.0,5.28
but here's what happens when you,84.049,4.871
actually do a healthy keto plan and,86.28,4.35
you're doing in a minute fasting you are,88.92,2.82
lowering insulin,90.63,4.11
now remember insulin suppresses blood,91.74,5.58
sugars it pushes blood sugars down so,94.74,5.94
now we don't have the quantity of,97.32,6.96
insulin but we still may have insulin,100.68,6.18
resistance because that takes a while to,104.28,7.229
to correct in the body so if we have a,106.86,6.719
lower amounts of insulin and insulin,111.509,5.61
resistance your blood sugar might go up,113.579,6.631
a little bit more okay but you're still,117.119,5.371
being ketosis so you might still like,120.21,6.81
show like 1.0 or 1.2 1.5 and your ketone,122.49,7.739
levels and have blood sugars that are 90,127.02,4.77
to 105,130.229,3.361
that's totally normal,131.79,3.93
it's just gonna take time for this to,133.59,4.619
heal and then you'll see it'll come down,135.72,4.2
it's basically all that means it's,138.209,3.481
you're in a transition phase and there's,139.92,2.64
nothing to worry about,141.69,2.159
so as long as you're feeling good you,142.56,3.33
have a lot of energy and everything is,143.849,3.541
good I would not worry about it at all,145.89,3.12
but I just wanted to point out this fact,147.39,5.129
this can happen and it's because the,149.01,5.91
insulin is going down but you still have,152.519,4.44
insulin resistance which does take a bit,154.92,4.53
to actually correct that all right,156.959,5.191
