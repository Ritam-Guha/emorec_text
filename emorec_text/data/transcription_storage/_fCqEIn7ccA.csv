my name is Sarah I'm a certified,0.03,5.249
diabetes educator today I'm going to,2.34,5.49
demonstrate how to give insulin using an,5.279,5.221
insulin pen first you need to gather,7.83,4.95
your supplies which would be the insulin,10.5,6.06
pen itself an alcohol swab and the pen,12.78,6.749
needle then you want to wash your hands,16.56,5.37
with soap and water or use an alcohol,19.529,8.881
sanitation solution rub your hands,21.93,13.469
together until it's dry start by,28.41,11.669
removing the cap to the pan at this,35.399,7.68
point if you have cloudy insulin which,40.079,5.701
would include NPH insulin or mixture,43.079,6.121
thereof you want to mix it you mix it,45.78,6.72
with your palms like rolling it together,49.2,6.96
or you can go gently back and forth you,52.5,6.899
don't want to rigorously shake it if you,56.16,5.46
have clear insulin that does not contain,59.399,5.461
NPH then you can you don't don't have to,61.62,6.679
mix you can skip that part all together,64.86,7.56
use your alcohol lights to wipe the,68.299,8.011
rubber membrane on the end of the pen,72.42,3.89
and then remove the protective tab on,76.46,11.56
the pen needle push the needle into the,81.869,9.061
end of the pen and turn it clockwise to,88.02,7.59
tighten it next you want to do what we,90.93,7.619
call a safety check to make sure there's,95.61,6.149
no air in the system you'll dial the,98.549,7.291
dose indicator to two units remove the,101.759,6.871
outer needle cap and save that for later,105.84,5.459
the inner needle cap you can remove and,108.63,6.09
throw away so you've dialed to two units,111.299,5.1
you're going to push on the injector,114.72,3.509
button and watch the end of the needle,116.399,3.961
to make sure that you see some insulin,118.229,4.981

hips and as far laterally as you can,151.29,5.31
comfortably reach you want to rotate,153.84,4.89
sites so that you're not returning to,156.6,4.34
the same couple places again and again,158.73,4.92
