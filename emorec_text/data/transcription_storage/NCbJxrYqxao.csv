hi guys there's a condition called a can,0.03,4.41
ptosis Negron's I want to talk about,2.76,4.289
this is basically a hyperpigmentation in,4.44,4.86
the body folds of the you know,7.049,5.311
underneath the armpits the forehead the,9.3,6.209
groin different parts of the body where,12.36,5.91
it's kind of a darkened appearance now,15.509,5.61
if you see someone like this or you have,18.27,5.07
this you can pretty much know for sure,21.119,4.261
what they're consuming it's refined,23.34,4.13
carbohydrates they're eating frequently,25.38,4.92
because what causes this condition is,27.47,6.64
high levels of insulin okay or insulin,30.3,5.64
resistance which then causes high levels,34.11,4.98
of insulin so that's a pre-diabetic,35.94,5.76
situation and this person could also be,39.09,4.98
a diabetic as well but I just want let,41.7,4.949
you know that this can be reversed if,44.07,8.37
you reduce the insulin okay so I put a,46.649,8.611
link down below of some possible things,52.44,4.709
you can do relating to diet,55.26,4.049

people died of this vitamin deficiency,78.81,5.52
than any other vitamin deficiency ever,81.33,7.05
okay in the US and basically the where,84.33,4.89
that came from,88.38,5.9
is people consuming milled corn,89.22,9.39
ground-up cornmeal like in grits okay in,94.28,6.43
