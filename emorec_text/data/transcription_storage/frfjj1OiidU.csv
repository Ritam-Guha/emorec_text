hello everyone this dr. jawanda,44.14,3.79
I'm going to answer a question when,46.13,4.77
doing the ketogenic diet why would you,47.93,7.68
may have high blood sugar now the thing,50.9,5.97
about the ketogenic diets one thing I,55.61,3.57
always ask my patients is okay how long,56.87,4.08
do you want it how much weight have you,59.18,2.52
lost,60.95,2.609
and what's the duration of the weight,61.7,5.31
that you lost recently okay because what,63.559,4.981
could happen is that they previously,67.01,5.18
could have had insulin insulin resistant,68.54,5.7
before they went Akio generate died,72.19,3.67
especially if they lost a lot of mount,74.24,2.879
of weight if you lose a lot amount of,75.86,3.0
weight most likely you've been you were,77.119,3.421
in some resistant without even knowing,78.86,3.81
okay because insulin resistance takes,80.54,5.52
time to create what happens when you're,82.67,5.85
in some resistance your body's pumping,86.06,4.65
out anywhere from five to nine times the,88.52,5.25
amount of insulin into the system to,90.71,6.86
create it's a resistance so the goal is,93.77,6.0
okay to make a greater blood sugar,97.57,4.329
response because at the moment because,99.77,3.66
when you're in some resistance what's,101.899,2.911
happening the cells don't take insulin,103.43,5.52
too easily so when you're when we take,104.81,5.91
in carbohydrate the function of insulin,108.95,3.779
is twofold one to lower blood glucose,110.72,5.52
and also store fat so when we take in a,112.729,5.941
carbohydrate meal our pancreas releases,116.24,4.23
insulin to lower the blood glucose,118.67,4.32
levels however if you're taking an,120.47,4.259
excess amount of carbohydrates yes,122.99,3.33
you're going to go on this wave pattern,124.729,4.411
to the point where yes your instant,126.32,4.35
resistant because the cells are not,129.14,5.099
actually bringing in the insulin okay so,130.67,4.8
what happens when you become insulin,134.239,4.171
resistant it sends a signal to the liver,135.47,4.98
the liver says hey okay I'm going to,138.41,4.38
make sugar okay if they're a process,140.45,4.68
called gluconeogenesis gluconeogenesis,142.79,5.07
as a process that we have to make sugar,145.13,4.68
from a non carbohydrate source this is,147.86,5.01
how we survive in between meals however,149.81,5.76
if your insulin resistant already okay,152.87,3.69
you're going to have too much,155.57,3.15
circulating glucose and the pancreas is,156.56,4.86
going to shunt out more insulin okay and,158.72,4.32
this is where you can become more in,161.42,3.03
some resistance is where you become a,163.04,4.229
type-2 diabetic and so for and so on so,164.45,4.8
when doing the ketogenic diet one thing,167.269,3.451
that I want to reassure my patients is,169.25,3.93
that you're by you probably still miss,170.72,5.58
insulin resistant mode okay,173.18,5.61
it will subside it will it will take it,176.3,4.14
does take time okay,178.79,3.96
so possible high-gluten the reason why,180.44,4.32
you passe have high blood sugar is,182.75,4.02
because excess amount of if you took an,184.76,3.78
excess amount of protein the night,186.77,3.75
before and you test your blood sugar the,188.54,4.11
next morning sure you may have increased,190.52,4.17
sugar because excess amounts of proteins,192.65,4.56
what can't convert to have an insulin,194.69,3.99
spike okay,197.21,4.29
also you may have had too many frequent,198.68,5.01
meals if you have too many frequent,201.5,4.56
meals if you're starving yourself and,203.69,4.14
you have too many frequent meals yes,206.06,3.63
you're going to have it's going to spike,207.83,3.78
the system you're going to have spikes,209.69,5.73
and insulin and blood sugar if your,211.61,5.55
body's not used to it remember you have,215.42,5.04
to slowly adapt to it also very,217.16,6.51
important high cortisol cortisol is a,220.46,5.76
stress hormone when released cortisol,223.67,3.9
again it's a blood sugar,226.22,4.95
okay our glucose level increases when,227.57,4.86
were these cortisol one the function of,231.17,4.17
cortisol is to increase blood sugar okay,232.43,5.18
and it peaks at 8 o'clock in the morning,235.34,5.55
Glu cortisol typically Peaks about a,237.61,5.53
half an hour after we wake and then it's,240.89,4.62
going to let then stabilize however,243.14,5.7
though in times of stress it may peak,245.51,5.28
and it may peak longer so when you take,248.84,3.69
your blood glucose levels yes you may,250.79,4.71
have high blood sugar at that at that,252.53,5.97
point in time so I always want to sure,255.5,4.77
reassure my patients who are doing keto,258.5,4.26
the key genic diet it's gonna take time,260.27,4.68
to level off because your body's not,262.76,5.76
used to this so what can you do 200 what,264.95,5.31
can you do look at what's the process,268.52,3.87
how can you help yourself faster for one,270.26,4.59
again lower the carbohydrates when you,272.39,4.41
don't eat game carbohydrates you don't,274.85,4.92
have an insulin response also to,276.8,6.33
exercise when we exercise it's going to,279.77,6.12
help stabilize our blood sugar due to,283.13,5.87
the mechanism of exercise on the body,285.89,6.86
sleep try to get sleep when we sleep our,289.0,6.88
body repairs itself while we're sleep,292.75,7.24
and try to get good sound sleep try to,295.88,6.45
decrease our stress levels okay because,299.99,4.53
again the high cortisol will increase,302.33,4.23
the blood sugar now with decreased,304.52,3.57
stress levels you may want to take in,306.56,3.48
I've done previous videos,308.09,4.88
the adaptogens like ashwagandha,310.04,5.22
ashwagandha is phenomenal of damage in,312.97,6.3
which will help our body adapt to stress,315.26,8.34
all stupit aciem we need 4700 milligrams,319.27,7.27
of at ounce in a day 1500 milligrams of,323.6,7.02
sodium potassium relaxes the body also,326.54,7.86
to vitamin b1 vitamin b1 200 milligrams,330.62,5.04
first thing in the morning it's going to,334.4,2.67
help with the cell mitochondria to,335.66,3.39
produce more cellular energy which will,337.07,4.23
help level eyes and stabilize our blood,339.05,5.46
glucose levels ok so again if you have,341.3,5.85
high blood sugar spikes with it on the,344.51,3.9
ketogenic diet I always tell my patients,347.15,3.96
it's going to be ok your body just has,348.41,3.87
to adapt to it,351.11,3.54
ok hope this helps please leave a,352.28,3.18
comment down below,354.65,2.37
I'll see you the next video thanks for,355.46,3.98
