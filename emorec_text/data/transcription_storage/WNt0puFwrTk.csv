"The major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
is a set of cell surface proteins essential",10.61,6.33
"for the acquired immune system 
to recognize foreign molecules in vertebrates,",16.94,18.36
which in turn determines histocompatibility.,35.3,7.47
"The main function of MHC molecules is 
to bind to peptide fragments derived from",42.77,13.11
"pathogens and display them on the cell surface
for recognition by the appropriate T-cells.",55.88,6.91
"MHC molecules mediate interactions of leukocytes,
also called white blood cells (WBCs), which",62.79,5.66

the human leukocyte antigen (HLA).",89.7,25.32
"In a cell, protein molecules of the host's
own phenotype or of other biologic entities",115.02,8.38
are continually synthesized and degraded.,123.4,6.73
"Each MHC molecule on the cell surface displays
a molecular fraction of a protein, called",130.13,14.64

or non-self, thus preventing an organism's",144.77,5.689

"In its entirety, the MHC population is like
a meter indicating the balance of proteins",154.54,9.18
within the cell.,163.72,4.25
"The MHC gene family is divided into three
subgroups: class I, class II, and class III.",167.97,5.2
"Class I MHC molecules have �2 subunits so
can only be recognised by CD8 co-receptors.",173.17,3.72
"Class II MHC molecules have no �2 subunits
so can be recognised by CD4 co-receptors.",176.89,12.41
"In this way MHC molecules chaperone which
type of lymphocytes may bind to the given",189.3,13.23
"antigen with high affinity, since different
lymphocytes express different TCR co-receptors.",202.53,6.65
"Diversity of antigen presentation, mediated
by MHC classes I and II, is attained in at",209.18,7.69
"least three ways: an organism's MHC repertoire
is polygenic (via multiple, interacting genes);",216.87,6.31
"MHC expression is codominant (from both sets
of inherited alleles); MHC gene variants are",223.18,6.07
"highly polymorphic (diversely varying from
organism to organism within a species).[3]",229.25,3.69
"Major histocompatibility complex and sexual
selection has been observed in male mice making",232.94,4.85
"mate choices of females with different MHCs
and thus demonstrating sexual selection.",237.79,5.12
"Also, at least for MHC I presentation, there
has been evidence of antigenic peptide splicing",242.91,17.52
"which can combine peptides from different
proteins, vastly increasing antigen diversity.",260.43,16.54
"MHC is the tissue-antigen that allows the
immune system (more specifically T cells)",276.97,26.14

"MHC interacts with TCR and its co-receptors
to optimize binding conditions for the TCR-antigen",356.36,19.609
"interaction, in terms of antigen binding affinity
and specificity, and signal transduction effectiveness.",375.969,8.16
"Essentially, the MHC-peptide complex is a
complex of autoantigen/alloantigen.",384.129,5.01
"Upon binding, T cells should in principle
tolerate the auto-antigen, while activate",389.139,5.28
