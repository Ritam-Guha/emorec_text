"So I'm doctor Trier I am that pediatric
liaison",0.19,4.58
"for Sacramento and I am working with Deb
to",4.77,3.88
"enhance our pediatric training in
the ED",8.65,3.79
and so every month what were going to be doing is,12.44,3.56
"these pediatric mock codes based on a
different topic and",16.0,3.63
"this month's topic is Pediatric Diabetic
Ketoacidosis",19.63,4.75
"and so I'd like to start off with his
bill a scenario seven year old male",24.38,4.36
that presents to the,28.74,0.41
emergency department one day history vomiting and just not feeling well,29.15,4.53
"current vitals are up there. Normal
temperature",33.68,3.14
"little bit tachycardic, a little bit tachypneic, a little bit",36.82,3.21
"hypertensive with the blood pressure
90/65",40.03,3.06
"when you look at him. He is a little lethargic 
be able to answer questions he knows",43.09,3.98
where he is,47.07,0.62
and then on further examination,47.69,3.17
"you notice that he has kinda a fruity 
order to his breath",50.86,3.49
"he has dry mucous membranes but
otherwise his examination",54.35,4.22
"is a relatively normal. We get some past
medical history",58.57,3.52
"no medical problem. He doesn't take any
medication. So",62.09,3.52
lets try to get some labs. The labs we draw are chem seven.,65.61,3.509
"We can get a VBG. It's not as traumatic
so that ideal",69.119,3.401
"and a urine. So these are the lab
that we see and we notice that",72.52,4.08
he has a sodium of 147. Potassium of 3.5,76.6,3.44
chloride 112 and a bicarb of 5,80.04,3.43
creatinine is normal. BUN elevated at 28,83.47,3.61
and glucose is 430 and,87.08,3.09
ionic gap of 30. He is,90.17,3.0
anion gap metabolic acidosis. There are many things that cause that.,93.17,3.269
In this case it looks like it DKA. ,96.439,3.101
"Also you can see the urine shows
4 plus glucose in addition to",99.54,3.969
"having ketones. So there are four
things that really define DKA.",103.509,4.211
"When you have a pH is less than 7.3
If you have a",107.72,3.52
bicarb that's less than 15 and a glucose that's greater,111.24,3.489
"than 300 and also the present the keytones.
With those four things",114.729,4.341
that identifies Diabetic Ketoacidosis,119.07,3.21
"Okay, so some pathophysiology",122.28,3.33
this is what happens. You have insulin receptors on the cell.,125.61,3.91
insulin binds to cell about allows glucose to go in,129.52,3.5
"the insulin also penetrate the cell
get in there",133.02,3.12
and blocked the pathway of lipogensis. So it prevents the lipids from getting,136.14,4.62
metabolized. With out that insulin,140.76,3.199
"what happens is you have all the glucose
the outside of the cell",143.959,3.051
"the insulin doesn't get into the cell. You
have all these fatty acids that are",147.01,3.72
getting in and being,150.73,1.66
"oxidized into  acetone, acetoacetate",152.39,3.59
and beta-hydroxybutyrate. Those are all,155.98,3.24
keytones. That's the ketogenesis. With the production of those ,159.22,3.57
compound what happens is you have hydrogen ions,162.79,3.12
used causing acidosis. Right? The acidosis ,165.91,3.829
in a cell causes the potassium to go,169.739,3.03
out at the cell. Extracellularly. So with,172.769,3.981
"okay, so you have a high potassium out of the cell. You have all these keytones",176.75,3.7
in the cell,180.45,0.53
"You have acidosis. Right? and so what
happens you'll have all the glucose on",180.98,4.16
the outside,185.14,0.8
The uptake,185.94,3.15
"of glucose within the kidneys is
roughly around",189.09,3.27
180 to 200 micrograms per deciliter,192.36,3.15
and so that's the threshold. So as soon as you hit that threshold,195.51,3.28
"your going to be spilling glucose in the urine
which is causing an",198.79,3.57
"osmotic dieresis. So your going to be
peeing more. The potassium is going to be",202.36,4.53
"in the urine. Right?  Your going to
dehydration. Okay",206.89,3.709
so three things dehydration going on,210.599,3.151
"You have potassium that's getting out of the cell and you have
the acidosis.",213.75,3.11
you have the osmotic diaeresis. Right? All  of those things playing in because of,216.86,4.12
"lack of insulin. Okay, that's part of
physiology",220.98,3.38
and that's what we have to treat. ,224.36,3.129
and that's whats causing all the symptoms the drinking and peeing and then,227.489,4.11
"not feeling well the lethargy and the
dehydration. These are questions that I",231.599,4.071
just what you read.,235.67,1.12
How much fluid would you administer as a boules? How much insulin would you,236.79,2.99
start to administer?,239.78,0.599
"and and then what type IV fluid would you
wanna start and at what rate?",240.379,4.0
"let's try it  with just giving fluids first.
The dose",244.379,3.17
to bolus children is 20 ml per,247.549,3.3
kilograms. One time bolus.Typically that,250.849,3.42
"bolus will increase the hemodynamics.
If  the hemodynamic",254.269,4.03
"don't improving they need to do a second bolus.
want you don't want to do is an aggressive",258.299,3.361
hydration,261.66,0.75
in kids. So after the initial bolus,262.41,3.44
"what we are going to do is we're going to start a
maintenance and 1/2 normal saline",265.85,4.95
so in order to calculate the maintenance fluid for,270.8,3.04
"Pediatrics we use the following formula:
for up to 20 kilograms we use",273.84,4.5
"four milliliters per kilogram from twenty
to thirty",278.34,3.45
kilograms two CC's or two milliliters per,281.79,4.25
"kilogram and after 30 kilograms we use
one cc",286.04,3.79
"per kilogram. You talk about giving
insulin. One major thing",289.83,5.49
"you have to really consider before you guys ever give insulin
is what is the potassium.",295.32,4.129
"Because their already depleted potassium on
our",299.449,3.25
chem 7 earlier I think was 3.5. So,302.699,3.181
"with 3.5 you already have all the potassium
has been shifted out of the cell.",305.88,4.8
"typically if all the potassium is shifted out of the cell you would
expect like hyperkalemia",310.68,3.209
of 5 or 6,313.889,0.911
but now he is at 3.5. So he's been wasting,314.8,3.23
"so if you to give insulin now what would
happen is insulin has the affective",318.03,3.669
"shifting the potassium back into cells.
He'll become hypokalemic",321.699,4.511
and he will go onto ventricular tachycardia,326.21,3.22
"and he can die that is very key for people
to look out for. The potassium.",329.43,4.39
If we do have a low potassium what we have to look at ,333.82,3.05
is replacement. Even before we give insulin. Or during giving insulin,336.87,3.919
and so if it's less than 5 we give 40 mEq per liter,340.789,3.121
of fluid. We just put it in to maintenance. ,343.91,3.67
so what you wanna do the dosing is 0.1,347.58,3.25
"units per kilogram per hour we want to
continue that",350.83,3.88
"So our blood sugar was 430. So
we're gonna",354.71,3.019
"slowly decrease the glucose between 50 to
100 milligram per deciliter per hour",357.729,4.391
"I don't care about the sugar. What I care
about is the acidosis. ",362.12,4.03
the insulin is going correct the acidosis. Because what it's going to do,366.15,3.45
it's going to bind to the receptors. It's going to,369.6,3.02
"have the glucose get into the cell and it's also gonna
deregulate",372.62,3.72
"are the counter regulatory hormones like we
talked about before",376.34,3.24
a break down of lipids and the gluconeogenisis,379.58,3.1
so the process just has to start ramping up again,382.68,4.0
okay so,386.68,1.98
"while this is going on the glucose is going to
decrease so if I get a glucose that",388.66,4.21
left 250 I'm going to add sugar,392.87,3.86
"to my maintenance. Because what I don't
want to do is get into a hypoglycemia state.",396.73,3.57
What I wanna do is correct the acidosis,400.3,3.45
"and then you can monitor that by doing
chem sevens every two to four hours",403.75,3.57
"to see if you still have the acidosis
by looking at the bicarb",407.32,3.13
"and also the anion gap. And you generally do not
want to stop insulin. Add the sugar",410.45,4.91
"while going through this whole process. Okay so
we're going to continue with this case",415.36,4.23
scenario,419.59,0.53
"so over the last hour your patient
start complaining headache",420.12,4.61
he's now unresponsive,424.73,3.41
fixed and dilated pupils. Heart rate,428.14,3.33
50 reparations eight and he,431.47,3.34
is hypertensive. What's happening,434.81,3.17
he got cerebral edema. Bad,437.98,3.08
"bad bad. Why this occurs? We really don't
know. To decrease the pressure you can do",441.06,5.12
one of a couple things. One you could give Mannatol,446.18,3.93
one milligram per kilogram bolus. Two you give hyper tonic saline,450.11,3.72
for the respiratory depression you can,453.83,3.09
"intubate. Thank you for coming and if you
have any additional questions please",456.92,3.54
