I would never in a million years have,0.0,4.83
guessed that ten days after surgery I,2.61,3.93
would be out running around shop and,4.83,2.88
walking the neighborhood,6.54,4.019
life is grand the first couple of days,7.71,5.759
are the hardest four days later I feel,10.559,4.95
like a new person I was able to get up,13.469,4.681
get out of bed walk around tolerate,15.509,5.131
fluids get a shower it's just this,18.15,6.51
little incision and you know you take,20.64,5.309
your bandage off you get in the shower,24.66,3.18
you let the warm soapy water run over it,25.949,3.781
doesn't hurt at all it just it heals,27.84,3.0
from the inside out and it'll eventually,29.73,3.63
close on its own I am now eating chicken,30.84,5.85
and fish shrimp eggs cottage cheese,33.36,4.289
bananas,36.69,3.779
string cheese you know salt foods that,37.649,5.73
you're it's very very important that the,40.469,4.831
food is moist I mean definitely you're,43.379,3.691
checking your turkey it's got to be,45.3,5.579
moist I have learned that your bites,47.07,6.3
have to be very small that's been a big,50.879,4.11
challenge you use I'm used to taking a,53.37,3.18
big bite and then chew in it up fairly,54.989,5.25
small and then swallowing now your bites,56.55,5.43
literally need to be about the size of,60.239,4.081
an eraser on a pencil and so that's,61.98,4.26
that's a big change and then you need to,64.32,3.99
chew that very thoroughly because it,66.24,5.55
will hurt going down otherwise so forces,68.31,5.849
you to slow down but I was amazed I had,71.79,4.8
a piece of fish yesterday just a little,74.159,5.011
too obviously I think I ate maybe a,76.59,5.459
third of it and was too full and this,79.17,4.5
morning breakfast was half a scrambled,82.049,5.191
egg I think I expected that I would go,83.67,5.58
in and I would have surgery I would feel,87.24,5.669
bad for a month or so I would slowly get,89.25,6.06
to moving around maybe tolerating a,92.909,4.111
little bit of fluid here and there and,95.31,3.33
that it would just be this long,97.02,4.98
drawn-out process of recovery I'm ten,98.64,5.189
days out and I think day six I was out,102.0,5.18
shopping I mean really it's been amazing,103.829,6.72
amazing I am down 23 pounds since,107.18,5.29
starting the liquid diet 10 days before,110.549,4.53
surgery I'm wearing jeans I haven't worn,112.47,6.63
in two years I mean that was just talk,115.079,6.811
about a happy moment I think I did like,119.1,4.799
I said a little happy dance that I was,121.89,3.689
able to put these jeans on I'm wearing,123.899,3.661
blouses that I couldn't wear before that,125.579,3.24
because they were so tight around my,127.56,2.29
midsection,128.819,2.861
it's embarrassing nobody wants to look,129.85,4.53
like that so I wear blouses now that I,131.68,5.55
couldn't wear before everything it's,134.38,4.44
just that little bit of weight it's it's,137.23,3.33
easier to do anything it's easier to,138.82,3.45
walk around it's easier to sit in the,140.56,3.99
chair when you go somewhere it's that,142.27,4.29
little bit starting off has set me on,144.55,4.47
fire in the next thirty days I should,146.56,5.28
expect another 15 to 20 pounds of weight,149.02,5.64
loss then after that I'm looking at a,151.84,4.44
pound and a half to two pounds per week,154.66,5.16
I have not been hungry at all I've not,156.28,6.42
felt the first hunger pain at all it's,159.82,4.74
and it's the oddest feeling sometimes,162.7,3.78
you think my goodness it's dinnertime,164.56,3.57
you know it's a speed the kids you know,166.48,3.84
see the family and why I'm not even,168.13,2.76
hungry,170.32,2.67
you don't think about food all the time,170.89,4.29
anymore whereas that food was,172.99,4.89
controlling me before this now I can,175.18,5.34
control it for the first time in years I,177.88,6.51
have hope about my weight I mean I don't,180.52,5.49
even know how to express that I have,184.39,5.97
hope that I won't be obese forever that,186.01,7.02
I would I do I feel better already so,190.36,5.28
there's this there's this fire that's,193.03,4.23
been instilled in me and now to how much,195.64,4.14
better can I feel when I lose 60 pounds,197.26,5.46
when I lose 80 pounds what's life going,199.78,5.49
to be like then because right right now,202.72,6.9
life is grand I think if people really,205.27,7.38
knew that you can do this it's not,209.62,6.0
horrible it just takes commitment I mean,212.65,5.1
you you have to be mentally prepared to,215.62,4.08
do this and once you get to that point,217.75,4.41
that you're mentally prepared it's,219.7,4.68
there's no stopping it's amazing it's,222.16,4.8
it's not as scary as I thought it would,224.38,5.16
be I was terrified in the beginning now,226.96,4.26
I just want everyone to know it's not,229.54,5.23
that bad just be committed,231.22,3.62
you,234.77,3.449
