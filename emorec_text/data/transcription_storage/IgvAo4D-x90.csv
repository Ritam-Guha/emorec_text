don't you ever wish that people would,0.12,2.73
just make really simple videos for,1.319,3.361
really simple topics especially related,2.85,3.42
to health well I want to do that with,4.68,3.06
this video but make it short you make it,6.27,3.03
sweet make it straight to the point,7.74,3.54
we're talking about glycemic index vs.,9.3,3.299
glycemic load and this is probably,11.28,2.76
something you've wondered you've heard,12.599,2.851
glycemic index before you've heard,14.04,3.63
glycemic load but maybe you're even,15.45,4.53
afraid to ask like what the heck is it,17.67,3.48
and what's the difference so let's just,19.98,2.549
make it really simple for you okay it,21.15,3.33
all comes down to how carbohydrates,22.529,4.17
react within our bodies and what they do,24.48,4.17
okay so make sure you hit that red,26.699,3.391
subscribe button and then please hit,28.65,3.18
that little Bell icon so you can turn on,30.09,3.36
notifications so you know whenever I go,31.83,3.9
live then after this video please check,33.45,4.05
out the rive Market down below in the,35.73,3.509
description that's an online grocery,37.5,3.45
store so I'm able to put like all my,39.239,4.291
keto boxes my fasting boxes all,40.95,4.05
groceries that I would normally get I,43.53,3.36
can consolidate them into like an online,45.0,4.2
grocery box that you guys can therefore,46.89,4.38
go and order so that way you utilize the,49.2,3.21
right market get groceries delivered,51.27,2.76
right to your doorstep so please do,52.41,3.03
check them out after you watch this,54.03,3.509
video super awesome deals there so,55.44,5.639
glycemic index is how quickly a fixed,57.539,6.48
amount of food or carbohydrates get,61.079,5.851
converted into glucose okay so yes if,64.019,5.881
you have one specific amount how quickly,66.93,5.34
does that elevate your blood sugar and,69.9,4.38
get converted into glucose okay so for,72.27,5.07
example glucose is 100 it's the highest,74.28,5.55
point that you can get to so for example,77.34,7.86
wheat bread is a 75 okay carrots are a,79.83,10.38
40 broccoli is a 15 and eggs are a zero,85.2,7.2
it's just that's just how you measure,90.21,5.1
sort of the carbohydrate glucose density,92.4,4.77
of something but here's something pretty,95.31,3.48
interesting so the American Journal of,97.17,3.57
Clinical Nutrition published a study it,98.79,3.99
was done out of Harvard took a look at,100.74,5.43
12 men gave them nearly identical meals,102.78,5.1
ok so literally they ate the same meal,106.17,4.409
same calories the same macronutrient,107.88,5.04
same proteins fats and carbs the only,110.579,6.091
difference was the glycemic index was 37,112.92,6.989
in one group and was 84 in another okay,116.67,5.4
so high glycemic versus low glycemic the,119.909,3.99
participants didn't even know their food,122.07,4.439
was different okay now what they found,123.899,4.621
is that the high glycemic index caused a,126.509,4.051
big blood sugar spike and then a strong,128.52,5.16
dip below baseline three hours later,130.56,4.62
but when they looked at their brains,133.68,4.41
under fMRI they found that the nucleus,135.18,5.699
accumbens was lit up like a Christmas,138.09,4.95
tree okay the nucleus accumbens is the,140.879,4.11
part that is associated with addiction,143.04,4.71
so we definitely saw that even when food,144.989,4.621
tastes the same higher glycemic index,147.75,3.359
will make you more addicted to it so,149.61,3.329
that's why you want to avoid high,151.109,3.481
glycemic foods you want to go low GI,152.939,4.231
even if it's comparable foods otherwise,154.59,6.3
now what's glycemic load okay see people,157.17,5.25
interchange them and they get them mixed,160.89,4.11
up class emic load is how much a non,162.42,5.489
fixed amount affects your blood glucose,165.0,4.019
okay,167.909,4.321
so again it's basically our glycemic,169.019,5.97
index multiplied by how much you eat so,172.23,4.289
we use that same example of wheat bread,174.989,3.931
wheat bread is no matter what going to,176.519,4.381
be a 75 whether you eat one piece of,178.92,4.17
wheat bread or hundred pieces of wheat,180.9,5.399
bread it's still the same glycemic index,183.09,4.83
it still spikes your blood sugar at the,186.299,4.34
same rate of speed but glycemic load,187.92,6.06
ends up factoring in how much of it,190.639,5.591
there is so in this case we read times,193.98,5.909
to still 75 GI but two times the load,196.23,6.599
okay the best way to compare it is like,199.889,5.581
caloric density we say we look at one,202.829,4.321
piece of food compared to another and we,205.47,3.0
say oh well that's more calorically,207.15,3.54
dense than the other so a simple thing,208.47,5.46
and be like a square of butter might,210.69,5.99
have just as many calories as an entire,213.93,6.089
steak okay but it's because the butter,216.68,6.369
is more calorically dense than the steak,220.019,5.94
right so it's all about balancing this,223.049,5.25
glycemic index in this glycemic load so,225.959,3.93
when you look at like Simic a load at,228.299,3.87
that number you want to understand well,229.889,5.07
how much of this food is making how much,232.169,4.74
of an impact in my body so you should,234.959,3.601
always look at glycemic index and,236.909,4.26
glycemic load because this can carry you,238.56,4.889
over for a longer period of time anyhow,241.169,4.32
that's a basic understanding of it hope,243.449,3.75
that helped cleared some simple science,245.489,3.271
up for you and make sure you're coming,247.199,3.18
back here every single day because we've,248.76,3.629
got new videos at 7:30 a.m. Pacific time,250.379,5.57
every day see you tomorrow,252.389,3.56
