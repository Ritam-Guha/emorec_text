"What's up, guys?",4.64,1.0
"Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.com.",5.64,1.21
It's another bodyweight Wednesday video.,6.85,1.92
"That means it's time for me to help you get
more out of your bodyweight training.",8.77,3.56
"Now, don’t tell me you're not training with
your own bodyweight.",12.33,2.33
I don’t care if you're a huge iron addict.,14.66,2.9
"You'd better make sure you're carving out
at least a little piece for bodyweight training",17.56,3.22
"because there's nothing that can replicate
the command of your own body and space.",20.78,4.13
"As a matter of fact, we're going to up that
command right here, today by including an",24.91,4.8
overlooked element of your training.,29.71,2.09
That is isometrics.,31.8,1.0
"Now, I've talked about isometrics here on
this channel before, but I think people overlook",32.8,4.47
their importance.,37.27,1.0
"They think of isometrics as 'easy things',
right?",38.27,2.53
"I'm not contracting, or I'm not shortening
a muscle, I'm not lengthening a muscle; I'm",40.8,3.87
just hanging out.,44.67,1.229
It doesn't have to be that easy.,45.899,1.541
"As a matter of fact, where and how you incorporate
your isometrics – especially in the bodyweight",47.44,4.23
training – can make all the difference.,51.67,1.65
"So here's what I'm suggesting: take a look
here at a standard pushup exercise.",53.32,4.59
"Now, we've talked about before how a push
up may not be the most challenging exercise",57.91,4.179
"for your chest for somebody that's capable
of bench pressing and lifting a lot of weight.",62.089,4.931
"However, you can make it much harder by inserting
isometric holds into the normal set that you're",67.02,6.55
doing.,73.57,1.0
"So I can decide to pause here after a few
regular repetitions in the bottom portion",74.57,5.5
"of the rep, or the middle portion of the rep,
or as I'm demonstrating even on the top portion",80.07,4.339
of a rep.,84.409,1.0
"what I'm doing here, though, is not just hanging
out.",85.409,2.771
"I'm actively engaging as many muscles as I
can to hold this position.",88.18,4.299
"So what you might not be able to see here
is I'm actually squeezing and dragging my",92.479,3.82
"hands together, like this, on the floor to
try to engage more activation of my chest.",96.299,5.801
"And believe me, I can feel it, but I don’t
just stop there.",102.1,3.39
Then I try to resume my normal repetitions.,105.49,1.97
"If you haven't tried this technique before,
you're in for a rude awakening because you",107.46,4.43
"may not be able to get that many more regular
repetitions.",111.89,2.69
"Remember, who cares?",114.58,1.639
Because we're not counting.,116.219,1.32
"All we're doing is measuring the other and
the ultimate effect that this will have on",117.539,4.911
you and your body in this set.,122.45,2.169
"Taking it to failure, taking it beyond failure,
making sure you get enough out of it.",124.619,3.901
The same thing here applies to other exercises.,128.52,2.93
"I can go up on a pull up bar – which is
already a difficult exercise for some – but",131.45,4.05
"for those that don’t find it difficult enough
and that don't have access to any weight to",135.5,3.98
"put on their body for an overload; try the
isometric holds intermittently.",139.48,5.09
"Again, try them in the bottom, try them at
the top, and try them in the middle; wherever",144.57,4.66
"you try them, try to then resume normal reps
after it.",149.23,4.35
"Like I said, it's a much different effect.",153.58,2.4
"It will dramatically shorten the length of
your set if you're used to doing rep after",155.98,4.63
"rep after rep, but with the ultimate goal
of getting you more from that set.",160.61,4.9
"We can even take it to the extreme with a
more difficult exercise.",165.51,3.96
A handstand pushup.,169.47,1.47
"Again, look what happens even here.",170.94,2.129
"I'm still doing the same idea of pulling my
hands together when I'm in the low, isometric",173.069,6.021
"hold, but on top of that, you can even see
muscles in my back that wouldn't necessarily",179.09,4.61
"have a chance to activate, become activated
because their role as stable items becomes",183.7,5.06
"that much more important when I slow down
the rep.",188.76,2.78
"So when I get it in here and I actually want
to stop and hold, now, all of a sudden, their",191.54,3.751
"job becomes that much more imperative to kick
in and allow me to maintain my stabilization",195.291,5.588
in this position.,200.879,1.0
"It's not easy, but guess what?",201.879,2.151
"The ultimate effect on my entire back and
my shoulder girdle is enhanced.",204.03,4.42
"Finally, we're going to actually hit our abs
here in a new exercise to wrap up this whole",208.45,4.6
video and also drive home this concept.,213.05,3.159
It's a modified L-sit.,216.209,1.111
"Really, just a suspended sit.",217.32,1.83
But here's the cool part.,219.15,1.3
It's difficult enough to hold an L-sit.,220.45,2.98
"It's still difficult to hold this bent-knee
sit.",223.43,2.639
"But it's even more difficult to hold it in
either reposition; the bottom or the top.",226.069,5.831
We're going to do just that.,231.9,1.0
"We're going to provide our body with this
elevated hip tuck.",232.9,4.07
"That's the dynamic portion, but at any point
in time we've got to be able to stop and hold",236.97,4.409
it and maintain our four or five second hold.,241.379,2.39
"Then come, what do we do?",243.769,1.051
We resume the reps.,244.82,1.83
"You're not going to be able to go for that
much longer, but as I said earlier, it doesn't",246.65,3.899
matter how long you last.,250.549,1.611
What matters is how much you make it count.,252.16,3.249
That's what makes muscles grow.,255.409,1.771
"That's what makes all the difference when
you're trying to get more form your bodyweight",257.18,2.95
training.,260.13,1.0
"If you've found this video helpful, guys,
make sure to leave your comments and thumbs",261.13,2.22
up below.,263.35,1.0
"If you're looking for a complete bodyweight
training program that utilizes no equipment",264.35,4.22
"at all, not even the benches that I showed
here, not even the pull up bar that I was",268.57,2.97
"on and trains your entire body with the main
goal of helping you to build muscle by incorporating",271.54,5.23
"advanced techniques like I just showed you
here; head to ATHLEANX.com to get our ATHLEAN0",276.77,4.17
program.,280.94,1.0
"All right, guys.",281.94,1.0
I'll be back here again in just a couple days.,282.94,1.0
See you!,283.94,0.18
