"It's been said if you never want
to have sex again, get married.",14.868,5.505
(Laughter),20.374,1.66
"Sex is one of the most contentious
issues in marriage today,",22.615,4.461
second only to finances.,27.576,2.358
There are many married couples,30.117,1.901
"that have not had sex
for months, even years,",32.019,3.679
"and that's OK as long as they are OK
with it and happily married.",35.699,4.551
"The problem arises when one person
in the relationship wants sex,",40.763,5.379
and the other doesn't.,46.143,2.051
"According to a national newspaper survey
of approximately 10,000 respondents",48.784,5.269
- mostly married men -,54.054,1.361
"75% were satisfied in their relationship,",55.744,4.994
"but more than 50%
were dissatisfied with their sex lives.",60.739,4.827
"We are having sex
- don't get me wrong -",65.567,2.848
"we are just having sex at the wrong time,
and with the wrong people;",68.416,4.476
I'll get to that later.,72.893,1.902
(Laughter),74.796,1.78
"We are having sex before we get married,
ten years on average,",76.577,4.351
"so we are effectively
in a long-term relationship",81.494,3.6
"and potentially, quite sexually bored
before we even mess up the marital bed.",85.095,6.457
And that has its consequences.,92.081,2.63
"Most brides today do not have sex
on their wedding nights,",94.712,4.681
"and 50% of men would not
have married their spouse",99.394,4.107
"had they known their marriage
was going to be sexless.",103.502,4.79
"So, everybody wants to know",109.063,2.114
"just how much sex
are married people having",111.178,3.376
"whether they are in heterosexual
relationships or same-sex unions.",114.555,5.037
"You all want to know what's going on
at the Joneses; well, not much.",119.593,4.379
(Laughter),123.973,1.551
"Only about 7% of married couples
set the sheets ablaze.",127.184,5.962
Most married couples have sex,133.995,3.229
"a little bit more than once a week
for the first decade of their marriage.",137.225,4.379
It decreases after that.,141.605,1.559
So they have sex about 58 times a year.,143.165,2.274
"And 20% of marriages meet the criteria
as a sexless marriage,",146.322,5.83
"and that, defined by the experts,
is sex less than ten times a year.",152.153,6.175
"So why aren't we having sex
in our marriages?",159.515,3.532
"There's a little-known
chemical in the brain",163.048,3.617
"conveniently called PEA or 'PEA, '",166.666,3.076
"and it's responsible for the elation,
the excitement, and the euphoria",169.989,6.335
"that you feel when you meet somebody
that you are sexually interested in.",176.325,5.819
It's a fantastic feeling.,183.724,1.922
"This chemical is gorging
through your blood vessels.",185.647,3.829
"You are so happy; that's
how powerful this little chemical is.",189.477,4.53
But what happens after two years,194.008,3.064
"is that chemical diminishes
as does sexual frequency.",197.073,4.911
That's just about the time,201.985,1.588
"you might get married
or may have conflict in your relationship,",203.574,3.284
"and that is why communication
is key to great sex.",207.214,4.549
There is another reason,211.764,1.77
"we are not having sex
in our relationship,",213.535,2.02
"and that has to do
with the sex education that we provide.",216.025,4.371
I'd like to share a story about myself.,221.192,2.591
"When I was a teenager, my mother
came racing into my bedroom, and she said,",224.202,4.415
"""Maureen, please, tell me",228.618,1.934
"you have not allowed a boy
to French-kiss you.""",230.553,2.961
"She was feeling terrible
that the sex education came a bit late.",234.58,4.149
"And I was feeling horrifically guilty,
as an Irish Catholic girl,",238.73,3.709
that I'd French-kissed a number of boys,242.44,2.218
(Laughter),244.659,1.409
by that stage.,246.069,1.53
We teach girls and women,250.012,1.827
"that sex is dirty,
and sex is bad, or it's over rated.",251.84,3.809
"We say, ""You're just going to get
a sexual-transmitted infection anyway,""",256.149,3.447
"or, ""You may get pregnant!""",259.596,1.308
"This whole fear-base thing
frightens women from enjoying sex,",260.906,3.214
"and we never talk about pleasure
or orgasm with girls and women.",264.121,5.048
"And in fact, some women say,
""Orgasm's not important,""",269.17,5.008
"and that the journey is just as good
as the destination.",274.179,3.89
I disagree.,278.07,1.03
(Laughter),279.681,1.25
Of course.,280.932,1.096
"I am the one who French-kissed
all the boys, as an Irish Catholic girl.",282.481,3.447
(Laughter),285.929,1.249
(Applause),287.179,1.55
"It's like getting on a train
with your lover,",290.895,3.399
"and you are going to the most pleasurable
place on the planet.",294.843,3.857
You are so excited.,298.701,1.623
"You are getting lubed up with all
the free drinks they are giving you.",300.325,3.776
This is amazing!,304.102,1.502
"And just before you reach
your destination,",306.199,2.468
"he gets off, and you don't.",309.377,2.496
(Laughter),311.874,1.368
You get my point.,313.243,1.442
(Laughter),314.686,1.179
(Applause),316.506,1.63
"The sex education
we have for boys and men:",320.896,3.659
that's entirely different.,324.556,1.581
"It's a global program, it's free,
it's accessible to everybody,",326.615,4.583
and it's known as internet pornography.,331.948,3.649
Fantastic!,335.598,1.309
"And it does nothing to teach
men and boys about intimacy",336.908,4.498
"which is really important to men and boys,",341.407,3.131
or how to make love to anybody.,344.539,3.489
"Also, we have a paucity of information
about sexual health",349.399,5.472
"for LGBTQI community,",354.872,3.143
and we need to add to that.,358.818,2.55
"Marriage can rapidly go
from a holy matrimony to holy hell",361.908,3.979
"with the finances, the kids,
the houses, the illness.",365.888,4.114
"I mean, you may have signed up
for sickness and health,",370.003,2.589
"but that was long before
you'd ever witnessed a man cold.",372.593,3.318
(Laughter),375.93,1.139
And...,377.07,1.039
(Laughter),378.11,1.465
And how about that richer or poorer thing?,381.136,2.83
"Ladies, we are going to have
to start going for richer.",383.967,2.989
"Most women today are working
inside and outside of the home.",386.957,5.159
"We are doing the lion's share
of the housework",392.117,2.268
"because according to research,
men don't feel they are that good at it.",394.386,3.978
And we are bridging the gap,398.365,2.84
"between growing children
and aging parents.",401.206,3.065
"We are exhausted doing it all
and never doing it.",404.272,3.92
"And when we are doing it,
we are checking our smartphones.",408.193,4.52
"10% of people check
their smartphones during sex",412.714,3.92
(Laughter),416.635,1.647
35% immediately afterward.,418.451,3.618
We are connected to the Internet,423.875,3.617
(Laughter),427.493,1.485
(Cheers) (Applause),431.899,2.33
"We are connected to the Internet
and disconnected from our would-be lovers.",441.452,6.035
Maybe this is the reason,447.882,1.793
"that the most common sex position
for married couples is doggy style.",449.676,6.614
"No, no, no!",457.183,1.0
It's not what you're thinking.,458.184,1.429
Get your minds out of the gutter.,459.614,1.941
"This is the one where he is
on all his fours and begs,",461.556,3.464
and she plays dead.,465.021,1.783
(Laughter),466.805,1.771
"I have a clinical practice where I see
patients that have sexual dysfunction,",473.22,3.916
"and there are two questions
that I ask everybody.",477.627,2.639
"The first one is,
""Are you sexually active?""",480.446,2.663
It's obvious.,483.11,1.096
"When I ask women,
they never say yes or no",484.702,5.137
"- well, they never say yes -",489.84,1.432
but they never say yes or no.,491.273,1.48
"They say, ""Sometimes,""",493.055,2.096
"""Sort of,"" ""I am not sure,"" ""He is""",495.152,3.879
(Laughter),499.032,1.678
"or they say, ""I am married.""",500.711,3.393
"I say, ""Well, that means no to me.""",504.444,2.907
"They say, ""Yes, sure. Right. it is no.""",507.352,3.259
"Most men complain
that women never initiate sex.",510.612,5.377
"The reason for this
is because, once again,",517.071,3.675
the sex education we provide to women.,520.748,3.181
Women falsely believe,524.142,1.75
"that female sexual interest, desire,
precedes sexual activity,",526.205,5.571
"when in actuality,",531.777,1.854
"it is sexual activity that prompts
sexual interest and desire.",534.209,5.542
"Sexual arousal emerges
as a result of sexual activity.",539.752,5.477
"So, you guys, I know,
intimacy is important to you.",547.821,5.242
"The most important question
that reflects this,",554.41,2.842
"that I receive from you,",557.253,1.619
"is, ""How much masturbation
is too much masturbation?""",558.873,3.868
(Laughter),562.742,1.189
"So, I just say, ""Well,
as long as you can go to work",563.932,6.211
(Laughter),570.144,2.138
"you should be fine.""",572.283,1.729
And then I realize,574.703,2.057
"that that's perhaps
all that what you are doing at work.",578.6,3.849
(Laughter),582.45,1.617
"So, I know intimacy is important.",584.068,3.931
"You want to come home,
and you want to make love to your wife",588.0,2.92
if you are in a heterosexual relationship.,590.921,2.009
"So after a long
and quite possibly very hard day,",592.931,5.384
"you come home to a bit of chaos, perhaps,",599.506,3.528
"but you've just got sex on the mind,
and she says, ""Did you remember the milk?""",603.035,4.69
"And you are like,
""Darn! The milk! I forgot the milk!""",607.965,4.052
Don't beat yourselves up about it;,612.018,2.204
"if not for the milk,",614.223,1.022
"we have Facebook, hormones,
""I am feeling a little tired tonight,""",615.246,4.159
"""My stomach is sticking out, I am feeling
kind of fat, can't do it tonight,""",619.406,3.59
"""Didn't we have sex last month?""",622.997,2.019
"And you are like,
""That was actually last year!""",625.017,2.339
(Laughter),627.357,1.141
"You don't get it.
I mean, literally, you don't get it.",628.499,2.853
"But you're like, ""She is amazing,
she works in and outside of the home,""",631.353,4.309
"""She does a great job
with the kids,"" ""She volunteers,""",635.663,3.425
She even has time for girls' nights out.,639.089,3.555
"So, I brought a friend home
after one such girls' night out.",642.645,4.887
"As we approached her house, drove up,
she looked up to her bedroom window,",647.872,5.349
"she saw that the lights were on,
and she said,",653.222,2.252
"""Argh! Donny is waiting up for me.
Do me a favor.",655.475,3.617
Drive around the block a few times,659.093,1.801
(Laughter),660.895,1.035
"until the light goes out.""",661.931,1.671
"I said, ""Listen! You get in there
and make love to your husband,",663.996,5.275
"before somebody else does.""",669.272,1.902
"Because that is one thing
that will increase a woman's sexual desire",671.175,4.487
when someone else wants her man.,675.663,2.374
"Still unconvinced, she said,",678.735,2.977
"""I decided to extol
the health and beauty benefits",682.922,4.329
that sex has for a woman:,687.252,2.386
"a youthful glow, better sleep,
wrinkle-free skin.",690.178,5.42
"Keep driving,"" she said.",695.969,1.948
(Laughter),697.918,1.111
"There is a device that will increase
anybody's sexual desire,",700.059,3.87
"and that happens to be
the Mercedes-Benz 4matic convertible SL",703.93,3.393
(Laughter),707.324,1.0
and it comes in 64 colors.,708.325,2.339
"But if that doesn't do it,",710.676,1.801
"the desire to have a baby will rev up
any woman's sex drive.",712.478,4.069
"The problem is having that baby
is likely to kill it",716.548,3.538
"along with any marital eroticism
a couple may have had",720.087,4.33
because a lot of people believe,725.512,2.522
"motherhood and being sexual
is incongruous.",728.035,4.621
"John followed me on Linkedln for two years
before he mustered up the courage",733.528,6.0
"to make an appointment
about his sexless marriage.",740.078,2.909
"He'd been married for seven years,",742.988,2.119
"and they had never
consummated the relationship.",745.108,3.2
"Their parents were pressuring them
to have children",749.078,3.462
because they wanted grandchildren.,752.541,1.99
"When they came into my clinical practice,",755.574,2.819
"the second question that I ask everybody
that enters my clinical practice,",758.394,4.432
"most unfortunately, is,",762.827,1.809
"""Have you ever experienced sexual abuse
or unwanted sexual advances as a child?""",764.637,5.838
"This was the first time
this gentleman had learned",771.507,2.713

sexual abuse, as a six-year-old,",774.221,3.383
at the hands of her best friend's father.,777.605,2.848

sexually active, but she hoped to be.",810.637,4.762
"I thought, ""Fantastic!
Somebody is going to have sex here!""",815.417,3.564
"But she said, ""The problem, Maureen,",819.302,2.663
"is that these old guys
can't get it up anymore.""",822.905,3.47
"I said, ""Well, Ella, you might have
to go for a younger guy.""",826.914,3.099

"""Yes,"" some of you are saying.",840.299,1.919

"Ella is going to have to go
for a millennial.",849.732,3.719

""What's the big deal?",858.127,2.749
"Why treat my erectile dysfunction?""",860.877,2.189

the plane up in the air",866.36,3.422
"and keep the plane
in the air for the entire trip,",869.783,2.889

So if you can't get your penis up,875.582,2.169

"Erectile dysfunction
is the canary in the coal mine,",886.754,2.585

"So, these two medical conditions,",894.926,2.26

stress, substance use and abuse,",897.187,4.574
"excessive alcohol consumption,
unresolved conflict, financial issues,",901.762,4.848

"Men in sexless marriages cheat
to remain in that marriage, in general.",1020.58,5.048
