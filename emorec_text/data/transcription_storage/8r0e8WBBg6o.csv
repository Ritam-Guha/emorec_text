hello i'm dr brandt gibson and today i,0.399,3.28
want to talk to you about,2.24,4.559
why you shouldn't just use,3.679,5.121
a b complex vitamin for your peripheral,6.799,3.521
neuropathy,8.8,3.919
so the idea if you've if you listen to,10.32,3.439
any of my videos or you've,12.719,2.481
listened to anybody that's talking about,13.759,2.721
peripheral neuropathy they will commonly,15.2,3.04
talk about certain vitamin b's that are,16.48,3.28
very valuable in treating peripheral,18.24,2.16
neuropathy,19.76,2.72
vitamin b12 for example vitamin b1 or,20.4,3.76
ben photoamine for example,22.48,4.799
um vitamin b6 there's even some,24.16,6.48
discussion on the vitamin b9s and,27.279,5.521
b5s and all as you go through the,30.64,3.36
vitamin b's there's a lot of different,32.8,3.2
vitamins that can be helpful,34.0,3.52
for peripheral neuropathy so why,36.0,2.559
wouldn't you just say i'm going to take,37.52,2.719
the b complex vitamin,38.559,3.52
and hope i can hit them all and i can,40.239,3.201
work on all of that and actually,42.079,3.681
get the help that i need just from doing,43.44,3.52
that,45.76,4.479
so my question for you first so if you,46.96,8.239
were to go to a surgeon,50.239,7.761
and the surgeon found out that you had a,55.199,4.0
small area small,58.0,4.32
tumor or cancer they had,59.199,4.241
hadn't gone anywhere else but it was,62.32,3.52
just in that small little area,63.44,5.679
and they came in and you had,65.84,4.72
two surgeons that were talking about,69.119,3.121
what they were going to do one surgeon,70.56,2.96
came in and says,72.24,3.44
i'm going to cut out that whole area so,73.52,3.44
i'm just going to cut out a big,75.68,2.479
area around that to make sure that we,76.96,3.12
get the whole cancer out,78.159,5.681
and that will do the job,80.08,7.76
and the other one says although that,83.84,7.52
will work my recommendation is that we,87.84,4.239
minimize,91.36,3.2
how much damage we do to everything else,92.079,4.161
and we focus on just the tumor and we're,94.56,2.96
going to make sure that we get the whole,96.24,1.839
tumor,97.52,2.32
and there's nothing left but we're going,98.079,3.921
to go as small as we possibly can and,99.84,2.559
treat,102.0,3.28
just the tumor and we won't damage any,102.399,4.481
other tissues we won't damage any other,105.28,3.199
things you won't take out more than is,106.88,3.68
necessary and so forth which surgeon are,108.479,4.161
you going to use,110.56,3.839
both of them remove the cancer both of,112.64,3.04
them actually work,114.399,3.921
which one you're going to use we should,115.68,4.56
be doing the exact same thing,118.32,4.159
with vitamins for peripheral neuropathy,120.24,3.6
so instead of saying,122.479,2.721
i'm going to do the shotgun approach and,123.84,2.72
i'm just going to throw all the vitamins,125.2,2.239
at it,126.56,3.199
we should be doing a more direct,127.439,3.44
treatment,129.759,2.961
we should be saying okay what vitamins,130.879,3.281
do i need,132.72,4.159
do i need vitamin b12 maybe i don't do i,134.16,4.799
need vitamin,136.879,5.681
b6 maybe i don't,138.959,3.601
take a little bit further beta vitamin,142.64,3.28
b6 if you have enough vitamin b6 and you,143.92,2.48
add a,145.92,2.88
b complex vitamin you may be increasing,146.4,3.919
your vitamin b6 to such a level that the,148.8,3.439
vitamin b6 is now causing damage to the,150.319,2.961
nerves,152.239,3.041
so again instead of doing a shotgun,153.28,3.599
approach we should be doing,155.28,5.039
a surgical approach and actually,156.879,5.041
treating just the vitamins that are,160.319,3.601
necessary so instead of doing a b,161.92,3.84
complex vitamin i recommend you be,163.92,3.679
tested and you determine do you need,165.76,3.68
folic acid do you need vitamin b1 do you,167.599,2.401
need vitamin,169.44,4.0
b12 and there are specific ways you can,170.0,5.04
evaluate whether,173.44,4.719
you have a deficiency or even whether,175.04,4.8
you have a dependency on the vitamins,178.159,2.241
because,179.84,2.319
you may say well i've got i did the,180.4,4.72
blood test and my vitamin b12 was normal,182.159,5.121
well what is your hormone cystin level,185.12,3.199
do you need my,187.28,3.12
more vitamin b12 you may even though,188.319,3.601
it's in the normal range because you may,190.4,4.08
depend be dependent on that vitamin b,191.92,6.399
so my recommendation don't do b complex,194.48,5.039
vitamins when it comes to treating,198.319,3.041
peripheral neuropathy but instead,199.519,4.161
do the individual vitamins that your,201.36,3.599
body needs,203.68,3.52
to have a healthy nerve it's dr brandt,204.959,3.92
gibson this is your neuropathy nugget,207.2,4.399
day 139,208.879,4.401
why you shouldn't just use b complex,211.599,5.28
vitamins but should be very,213.28,3.599
