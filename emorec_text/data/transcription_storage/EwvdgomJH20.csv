hello I'm dr. knees go - welcome to,14.99,4.39
another initiative wound care window,17.19,4.02
another patient I'd like to share with,19.38,3.87
you and illustrate again some teaching,21.21,3.78
points about diabetic foot ulcers,23.25,4.019
off-loading in callus formation I have a,24.99,3.83
patient I'd like to talk to you about,27.269,4.59
she presented with diabetic foot ulcer,28.82,4.899
I'm going to show you an image from,31.859,5.401
October 17 this is the ulcer you'll,33.719,5.761
notice on the photo and she was managed,37.26,3.99
with the total contact casting and,39.48,4.32
didn't really quite well her last visit,41.25,5.309
to the center was January 9th you can,43.8,4.47
see that she healed very nicely with,46.559,3.75
aggressive offloading utilizing total,48.27,4.08
contact cast after that time we,50.309,4.651
transitioned her to orthotics and,52.35,6.27
inserts as typically is accomplishing,54.96,6.329
these patients or the standard of carry,58.62,4.709
these inserts are custom designed for,61.289,3.991
the patient to fit her foot and fit into,63.329,4.561
a pair of shoes that can have a wide toe,65.28,4.949
base and they're very soft these inserts,67.89,5.12
you'll note are designed to provide,70.229,6.091
offloading to the area of injury and,73.01,6.039
prior ulcer is a ulceration so her last,76.32,4.74
visit to the center was January January,79.049,5.551
and she's done fairly well in the past,81.06,5.64
with these inserts we advise these,84.6,4.07
patients to return frequently for,86.7,4.2
evaluation of possible callus formation,88.67,5.17
so that we can pair that callus down and,90.9,5.19
prevent the disasters that can't occur,93.84,5.16
with callus formation she has not,96.09,5.16
returned in four weeks but does come in,99.0,6.21
today so today I'm showing you the prior,101.25,6.509
area of injury and you'll see that she,105.21,5.699
has some fairly extensive callus built,107.759,6.57
up in this area we know the risks to,110.909,5.221
these patients when we do have callus,114.329,5.671
formation we can have sub callus,116.13,7.89
hemorrhage fluid accumulation and a more,120.0,6.719
concern the development of infection so,124.02,4.65
I'm gonna unroofed this area open up,126.719,2.391
fine,128.67,4.16
if there's any type of infection,129.11,6.65
underneath this find out the extent of,132.83,5.88
injury under the cows but you can see,135.76,5.08
this callus is the bane of our existence,138.71,4.89
as wound care providers taking care of,140.84,4.65
patients with diabetic foot ulcers so,143.6,3.39
let's go ahead and open that calloused,145.49,5.07
area so in evaluating the area I do feel,146.99,5.01
a callus I feel that this she was,150.56,3.99
somewhat boggy underneath it she's got a,152.0,4.79
little rent in the callus right here and,154.55,5.67
we can stick a forceps in and actually,156.79,6.22
lift that area and I'm gonna go ahead,160.22,7.86
and unroofed the callus with sharp,163.01,8.46
dissection the technique I'm using is,168.08,5.909
one you've seen in the past inserting,171.47,7.019
the Irish scissor blades under the,173.989,9.271
callus getting to the margin and open,178.489,10.861
easy a little hemorrhage around,183.26,6.09
and now you get an appreciation of just,199.92,6.87
how thick that dermis is that callus,201.84,11.19
formation isolate the cavity under the,206.79,13.31
callus by using my iris blades dissect,213.03,7.07
work our way all the way around,220.92,3.74
once again you'll see the Calais where,230.42,8.26
that little rent was I just don't think,234.66,7.29
that can get so after we unroofed the,238.68,8.58
area we evaluate it the good thing I'm,241.95,8.22
seeing is no evidence of franc tissue,247.26,6.72
necrosis I think we caught this fairly,250.17,6.78
early we do have a little lip here of,253.98,6.77
some additional callus we'll take down,256.95,3.8
and there might also be an extension yes,263.36,6.3
there is a little extension this way,266.16,3.5
but the tissue is viable I don't see any,271.86,6.4
evidence of perience which is certainly,275.889,4.831
good the redness that you see then,278.26,6.14
around the site is largely due to,280.72,7.44
inflammatory responses rather than Frank,284.4,8.05
infectious processes I find no crepitus,288.16,7.86
in this tissue at all and that's fairly,292.45,5.82
soft all the way around I'm a pretty,296.02,5.01
good job of evacuating so I hope you've,298.27,4.23
enjoyed this edition of the wound care,301.03,4.47
window this patient will be discharged,302.5,5.4
in a total contact cast again we're,305.5,4.02
going to need to protect it least we'll,307.9,3.9
have that discussion with her see her,309.52,4.29
fairly frequently for the management and,311.8,3.63
quite confident we get this healed again,313.81,4.169
but again this issue stresses the,315.43,6.42
importance of monitoring diabetic feet,317.979,6.601
for callus formation making sure they're,321.85,4.8
appropriately offloaded and when callus,324.58,4.11
does appear to be very aggressive in,326.65,5.46
managing that callus formation we'll see,328.69,5.32
you next time Thanks,332.11,7.67
