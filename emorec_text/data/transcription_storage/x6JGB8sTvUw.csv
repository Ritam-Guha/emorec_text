I get asked a lot of times about how one,12.7,3.16
"Penn compares to another and all this
kinda stuff and I've never really don't",15.86,3.37
"like a super comprehensive done
something to pass on to noodler's and",19.23,3.549

"I have the stipulates splash I had the
new dealers in a pun sit",50.489,4.5
"and I have the new dealers a hab so all
of these are flexner pans or at least",54.989,5.381
"softening to give you some pretty good
line variation",60.37,2.56
"and I get into a little bit showing you
how one near varies from another",62.93,4.4
"it's not the most comprehensive video in
the world but it's better than anything",67.33,2.91
"I put out so far regarding all these
different names",70.24,2.21

so it's got some good at line very",112.409,6.661
calming asking for his bell,119.07,1.36
"okay but it got some good line
variations to the thin lines are really",120.43,3.18
fairly thin,123.61,1.049
"and then when you write down you give it
some good pressure you can get some",124.659,3.96
really good variation,128.619,1.61
"so I means a twenty dollar pan its hand
you know it's been around for a couple",130.229,3.4
years it's,133.629,0.94
"it's been received pretty well there are
some people have issues a pen can be a",134.569,4.551
little finicky,139.12,0.92
"you know even I'm partner is my fingers
are you feel like this is because I had",140.04,3.46
to just never feel a little bit,143.5,1.39
"on my have to keep them every now and
then but you know",144.89,3.319
"it when her pen like it's gonna take a
lil bit tinkering",148.209,3.071
"people are looking for the a had
definitely don't expect it to be like",151.28,3.4
"perfect every time a lot of them are
fine in there",154.68,3.139
"they don't need a lot of tinkering but
if it does need that",157.819,3.31
don't be completely surprised,161.129,3.401
"you know so I'm using need those black

prefers heart of darkness,176.049,1.34
"in all of his flex pens found that to
be just think that performs",177.389,3.43
"kinda the best all around in his opinion
but anyway so this gives you a little",180.819,4.1
bit idea,184.919,0.71
"other performance I've the new there's a
ham",185.629,3.19
"that's one on one show you is the pilot
Falcon",188.819,3.681
"this pens been around for a number two
years but this one is actually the soft",192.5,3.03
"extra fine version which hasn't been
around that long calm but that's 10",195.53,4.23
"minute show you this because it gets the
most",199.76,2.069
line variation,201.829,7.0
"now I personally am NOT as big a fan in
the way that this new feels",210.47,3.7
"it is a lot finer you know it's a
Japanese pan on",214.17,4.14
"it does give good line variation but it
sounded sacrifices a little bit",218.31,6.27
"in the smoothness especially when you're
actually doing the flexing",224.58,5.97
so it's on it does get to a finer line,230.55,3.3
than they have those when you,233.85,3.05
"flex it out it doesn't flex out quite
has broadly",236.9,3.49
"as they had us see you you really don't
wanna",240.39,3.01
"overdue this pan that stuff because this
one is a lot of videos out there on",243.4,4.43
YouTube and stuff like that,247.83,1.29
"show people really kinda go in knots and
some other videos",249.12,3.88
"specially someone when they're gone
viral Chopin's that have been modified",253.0,3.23
so,256.23,0.939
"you know be careful when you're doing
this and set your expectations properly",257.169,4.521
"but now on you'll see if you're trying
to write with this",261.69,3.3
"Falcon you get a thinner line it's not
maybe quite as broad as drastic as the a",264.99,5.16
ham,270.15,0.59
"but if you wanna write small you know
this is the one",270.74,3.15
to do some he's an ex is here,273.89,7.0
them K I should put in here,283.21,3.179
yeah,286.389,6.121
there,292.51,1.08
"so for me personally not as enjoyable
overrunning experience just does not",293.59,3.97
"quite as smooth the soft fine is
significantly better though it's really",297.56,4.56
just that extra fine I find to be,302.12,2.04
"kind of cumbersome on and then the next
thing I show you in here is the new",304.16,4.41
learn upon said because this pan,308.57,2.09
"on has kinda recently come out and this
one is as",310.66,4.42
"you know really gone lobule stirred up
we've only had one shipment of them",315.08,3.97
"on but I thought it would be good to can
show you what's going on with it",319.05,3.55
"so this is definitely the broader really
wet pan",322.6,4.69
"really wet time the news actually fairly
smoothly so I got no complaints there",327.29,7.0
"by you can see in comparison to the
Falcon it's just like",338.51,3.39
"not quite the same kinda Penn so this is
about the thinnest line you're gonna get",341.9,5.56
"you know about a man prime medium there
may be even closer to a broad",347.46,3.94
"on but then when you wanna flex this
thing now",351.4,3.08
"might seem random or dry in check to see
if",354.48,3.11
"I have until this thing a couple days
Miriam",357.59,7.0
"this thing is only Inc Monster so it
definitely consumes",370.37,5.41
"some significant think an immense
employee issues you know this is just",375.78,4.13
not,379.91,0.48
"super on comment as a player on with it
i honest to goodness have not played",380.39,3.47
with an upon said quite as much,383.86,1.73
"as me I would've liked to bun me priming
up woman",385.59,4.29
sign on the annals of camera in a sec,389.88,6.76
K,396.64,4.45
"so wanted primed up properly who you can
get",401.09,3.24
and imus seen line with,404.33,3.15
"at this thing so it's its definitely not
gonna be like",407.48,4.58
"and everyday writer unless you're
writing really large",412.06,3.1
on beer you kinda Inc resistant paper,415.16,3.18
"where you can see it's almost more like
a paintbrush",418.34,3.13
"you know what I mean just like the line
variation that you get on this thing",421.47,3.37
"and the drive time is going to be insane
because this thing just dumped more ink",424.84,3.99
than any pendant,428.83,1.089
ever seen on one,429.919,3.461
there you have it it's just crazy how,433.38,3.62
"brought it gets how wet it gets it'll
probably be drying for the rest of this",437.0,4.88
video,441.88,0.69
"but that's not a monster you know new
evil thinking has been you hear someone",442.57,3.96
trying to hold,446.53,0.77
"too much make it seem like everything's
perfect on that one will take a little",447.3,4.02
bit angry as well,451.32,1.19
"275 dollar an you know the news they
have 20 bucks the Falcons 144",452.51,5.84
and the um min upon sit down 75 so,458.35,4.85
"it's not about the price though
necessarily I mean the price",463.2,3.36
"there's so many different factors when
it comes to price for these pens that's",466.56,3.359
really not just about,469.919,1.81
"you know our price: spend more money
I'll have a better",471.729,3.601
"flack spend per se there's a lot of
different factors going on",475.33,3.28
"but I'm just running the show you how
they write see is some idea if the price",478.61,3.29
is worse for you,481.9,0.769
"next but I have here this is a stick
your splash I'm intending to be on this",482.669,4.481
"one haven't gotten around to it yet so
this is kinda the first foray other hand",487.15,3.7
they spend a lot smaller on inside I,490.85,3.319
"clear body demonstrator kinda thing the
name is definitely smaller on this pan",494.169,4.541
"then on the other pans let me show you
how it runs",498.71,7.0
"so this plan has what's there's a
stainless steel pan has what's called",520.219,2.461
their,522.68,0.62
"they're out the flax they have it he
flexes the titanium flex name",523.3,4.659
"should I thought about it could end up
for this video but oh well",527.959,3.011
"it's too late now on this was called
their beef like so it's their stainless",530.97,3.669
steel oh no the beast enormously,534.639,1.75
"but on you can see it's got some
variation",536.389,3.12
on it takes more writing pressure,539.509,3.83
"course now it's a skipping out on me you
noticing that this is kind of a",543.339,3.6
trendline flex plans,546.939,1.221
but some I'm going to class probably,548.16,4.71
bun its I it's got some,552.87,3.079
"decent very Asian to it you know it's
not too bad it's going to be somewhat",555.949,3.5
similar to the Ahab,559.449,1.25
"except this one does not have an
internet feed so",560.699,3.58
"its on its struggling to keep up a
little bit little bit with me here",564.279,3.451
"you know this is one that the ink will
be a little bit finicky depending on",567.73,3.169
your choice,570.899,0.81
"so you'll have to play around kinda fine
down when it is in",571.709,3.36
"writing slower definitely helps but
there's no heat setting or anything that",575.069,4.76
you can do with this one,579.829,1.151
"on this pen is on you know sixty four
dollars",580.98,3.979
"so it's on you know kinda write in that
range like I'm gonna Ponson all them",584.959,7.0
it's breaking up just a little then,594.5,1.7
bun,596.2,3.54
"this one of a kind of mixed you know
experiences would personally",599.74,5.57
on this is kinda on the worse and,605.31,3.3
"what I normally seeing so probably not
representing as well as it could but",608.61,5.02
"you know this is real this is what I'm
experiencing right in this moment",613.63,3.83
"I could tinker tinker around with us
more practical more you would be better",617.46,3.6
"but that is what is is capable on its
typical splash",621.06,4.15
"and then on the last 1i have here's the
oman Sergi Val Bock with the",625.21,5.47
"14 karat extra fine extra flexible you
do that and this one is definitely most",630.68,5.08
expensive over the budget,635.76,1.16
"five hundred dollars but I don't want
you to think that because it's five",636.92,3.06
hundred dollars,639.98,0.83
"you're going to get necessarily 25 times
the benefit",640.81,5.26
"when you lose a hab there's a long
diminishing returns when it comes to",646.07,3.99
"done and just like there is with
everything there's a lot of other things",650.06,3.45
"going on with his pen ever explained
kinda what this pen has going on",653.51,3.25
in several other almost videos button,656.76,3.14
"in terms of how it writes how it flexes
out",659.9,3.15
thought I would show you here,663.05,7.0
"this one i'm having to really control
myself",672.24,3.67
"because all these other pens take a good
amount of pressure to write",675.91,3.76
"the Falcon not quite as much because it
is a golden all the steel ones",679.67,3.979
"you get I really press on you know that
is how they are",683.649,3.091
"on but this pan really doesn't take a
lot of pressure",686.74,4.52
"and it's going alright 14k he after my
current extra flexible so I can have all",691.26,6.699
the,697.959,0.391
"samples kinda next to each other so you
can see the line with here",698.35,4.25
"on the extra fine is pretty comparable
to the Falcon",702.6,4.07
"finer than all the other ones on in
flexing Italian",706.67,4.039
on I don't want to flex this thing out,710.709,3.43
"crazy because I am really not putting a
lot of pressure",714.139,3.711
"on here you know it's gonna flex out
about the same as a",717.85,3.489
"Falcon maybe I here last not gonna be
the same as the a have a mystical a",721.339,5.231
splash,726.57,0.66
"goes out a little broader but the thing
is that this thing is",727.23,3.549
"so much softer requires whole lot less
pressure",730.779,3.341
"than all the rest to these so you have
to be careful with it",734.12,3.529
"special if you use to somebody's other
ones because you can spring the times on",737.649,3.891
this,741.54,0.27
"easier than you might think on by
putting too much writing pressure",741.81,3.98
"you really got a whole level i and with
the Omaha switches",745.79,3.919
nice but you gotta go easy on him,749.709,3.361
"you know treat it like it's a five
hundred dollar pan been",753.07,5.47
"so I would say if you're looking for the
Oma's",758.54,4.01
"if you want a little bit align variation
here and there",762.55,3.08
"great but don't buy this five hundred
dollar Penn thinking",765.63,4.13
"I'll I spent so much money I can really
go crazy",769.76,3.56
"with this name that's not really the
case if that's what you're looking for I",773.32,4.24
would say go with,777.56,1.08
"something like the Ahab words twenty
dollars you can buy replacement name for",778.64,4.449
"a couple dollars if you do Springer
screw it up",783.089,2.321
"and you're good to go there's a lot of
other reasons which might want the Oma's",785.41,4.4
by I'm there you have it so,789.81,3.11
that is all these pans writing samples,792.92,3.88
"not perfect gum Hans kunnen key showed
you some",796.8,3.95
"railroading and some other things you
know that the overall thing that's",800.75,4.079
important,804.829,0.501
"all these flex plans is they take
practice practice that I have not even",805.33,3.9
necessarily done myself with some,809.23,1.91
these newer pens by thats what it is,811.14,3.71
"so if you are wanting to get into a Flex
Plan this gives you a little bit of an",814.85,3.98
idea,818.83,0.49
"maybe some other ones that you can
consider show you may be what",819.32,3.209
distinguishes them,822.529,1.131
"a little bit from each other on but be
prepared",823.66,3.83
"to do a little bit anchoring I'm sure
after watching this video you got about",827.49,5.92
"a hundred million questions and that's
totally OK",833.41,2.44
"you guys leave a comment on YouTube or
on the blog and I'll help answer",835.85,3.14
questions best I can,838.99,1.28
"but I hope you enjoy this video this is
something kinda different that I haven't",840.27,2.79
really done before,843.06,1.02
"it was just an experiment for me
hopefully it helps you out",844.08,3.04
"on it might be more questions than
answers but I don't know we'll see so if",847.12,3.65
you like this that's great,850.77,1.48
"arm if you wanna see more like it I'm
see more videos be sure to subscribe to",852.25,4.24
"my YouTube channel you can learn more
about",856.49,1.84
"all these pens on be like pens dot com
thanks so much for spending time with me",858.33,4.12
today,862.45,0.57
and be sure to right on,863.02,1.71
