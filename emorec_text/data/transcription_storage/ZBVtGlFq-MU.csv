so we have,2.159,4.24
really two categories of medications um,3.04,5.44
those that target at the level of the,6.399,3.521
tumor itself,8.48,3.36
uh in order to reduce growth hormone,9.92,3.2
secretion and in,11.84,3.919
some cases shrink the tumor remnant that,13.12,3.999
is present,15.759,3.36
we also have therapies that are more,17.119,4.401
targeted at decreasing the insulin-like,19.119,4.641
growth factor or igf-1 production from,21.52,3.04
the liver,23.76,2.64
in response to that growth hormone,24.56,3.2
secretion from the tumor,26.4,4.16
so really at two different levels and,27.76,4.56
these can be used as,30.56,4.96
single or monotherapies and in some,32.32,5.12
cases it is necessary to use,35.52,2.879
combinations,37.44,3.84
of these medications to control growth,38.399,4.721
hormone igf-1 levels,41.28,4.88
and tumor growth at the level of the,43.12,4.4
tumor,46.16,4.399
we think about somatostatin receptor,47.52,3.84
ligands,50.559,3.281
these are medications that bind to a,51.36,4.879
receptor on the surface of the tumor,53.84,4.96
they turn down growth hormone production,56.239,3.441
uh they can,58.8,3.759
slow growth tumor growth and sometimes,59.68,4.879
even lead to cell death,62.559,4.321
and so these are um very important,64.559,3.92
medications for use,66.88,4.08
for patients with acromegaly they,68.479,4.881
include some of,70.96,6.64
the older injectables sandostatin lar,73.36,8.399
and lanreatide autogel are both,77.6,6.72
intermittent intramuscular or deep,81.759,5.281
subcutaneous injections respectively,84.32,4.4
that patients will have an injection,87.04,3.92
every four weeks and in some cases every,88.72,4.16
six to eight weeks depending on the,90.96,3.28
control of their,92.88,4.879
of their disease um a newer uh,94.24,5.76
medication in the landscape in the last,97.759,3.201
decade,100.0,4.0
is passariotide lar it is a similar,100.96,5.04
somatostatin receptor ligand although it,104.0,2.56
is,106.0,3.6
uh more activity in many of these tumors,106.56,4.48
and can be used for,109.6,5.199
more aggressive or um large tumors that,111.04,6.0
are not as responsive to actual tidal,114.799,3.6
and rheotide,117.04,3.6
um and then and then we now have the new,118.399,3.521
kid on the block which is,120.64,3.519
oral octreotide capsules so we,121.92,3.28
understand how,124.159,4.32
octreotide works to treat growth hormone,125.2,4.96
tumors and so now,128.479,3.601
uh there is an oral formulation so,130.16,4.0
instead of a monthly injection,132.08,5.12
or um or every six weeks or every eight,134.16,4.079
weeks patients,137.2,2.8
now have a choice to do the oral,138.239,3.841
octreotide capsules which would,140.0,4.56
be twice daily and so it just really,142.08,3.92
depends on,144.56,4.8
the patient's preference their,146.0,6.0
own personal characteristics in terms of,149.36,3.28
the,152.0,3.44
tumor as to whether which of those,152.64,6.0
therapies would be appropriate for them,155.44,6.56
with regard to a therapy that targets at,158.64,5.04
the level of the liver,162.0,4.48
we have pigvisimont which inhibits the,163.68,3.52
production,166.48,2.64
of insulin like growth factor from the,167.2,4.24
liver in response to growth hormone,169.12,5.04
so it's not really going to control the,171.44,3.439
tumor,174.16,3.2
growth per se or shrink the tumor but it,174.879,4.961
does lead to lower igf-1 and can really,177.36,3.76
alleviate symptoms,179.84,6.0
in many patients because of that hormone,181.12,4.72
