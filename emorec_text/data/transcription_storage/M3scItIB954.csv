hey guys today I'm going to talk about,0.03,3.869
one of the dangers of having glucose in,1.439,4.44
your urine so let's say for example you,3.899,3.871
have a glucose tester and you find,5.879,4.321
glucose in the urine that means that,7.77,4.17
your blood sugars the glucose in your,10.2,6.12
blood is minimally at 225 okay or more,11.94,6.839
and it's spilling off into the urine so,16.32,4.14
this is one of the ways that the body is,18.779,4.17
trying to get rid of this toxic glucose,20.46,4.59
okay by just peeing it out,22.949,4.801
it's called osmotic diuresis and the,25.05,4.979
complication of having this is that it,27.75,5.54
pulls out minerals specifically,30.029,6.751
potassium sodium chloride and other,33.29,6.49
minerals and it leaves you dehydrated,36.78,5.189
okay that's what happens with a diabetic,39.78,4.529
and not having the correct mineral in,41.969,5.25
fluid ratio gives you a headache you can,44.309,6.961
start having fatigue confusion your,47.219,5.851
nails become purple that's one of the,51.27,3.75
symptoms and a lot of heart problems,53.07,3.809
arrhythmia problems because you need,55.02,3.6
these electrolytes to keep the heart in,56.879,3.961
rhythm and so it sets you up for,58.62,4.5
increasing risk for having a heart,60.84,2.609
attack,63.12,3.06
now on top of that usually a diabetic,63.449,4.591
has high blood pressure and they're,66.18,4.14
taking diuretics which also pull out,68.04,4.23
these electrolytes and many times they,70.32,3.75
also have digestive issues they might be,72.27,4.86
in some anti acid which also blocks the,74.07,4.65
absorption of minerals from the stomach,77.13,3.27
level so we're gonna actually have even,78.72,4.649
less minerals and if they're drinking a,80.4,5.85
lot of water without these minerals,83.369,4.86
they're flushing out more minerals,86.25,4.14
they're actually diluting the urine you,88.229,3.421
have to understand that we need these,90.39,4.32
minerals to help reverse the blood sugar,91.65,5.19
problem in the first place in fact if,94.71,3.96
you take potassium it actually can help,96.84,4.56
your blood Sugar's improve also one of,98.67,4.83
the symptoms of a low salt diet is,101.4,4.259
insulin resistance so having these,103.5,4.5
minerals with salt and potassium and,105.659,5.161
magnesium are crucial in helping your,108.0,4.86
blood Sugar's so if you're noticing you,110.82,3.24
have glucose in the urine now you,112.86,3.0
understand what's really happening so,114.06,4.379
don't just stop by taking these minerals,115.86,5.28
to prevent dehydration symptoms actually,118.439,5.131
fix the reason why it's occurring in the,121.14,4.5
first place so I'm gonna recommend two,123.57,3.78
