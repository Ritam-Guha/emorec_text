I'm Lindsay and I gave birth to my,14.84,5.32
little girl yesterday and I was,17.76,4.109
diagnosed with gestational diabetes,20.16,4.89
about their two sex weeks pregnant so I,21.869,5.581
had to have him a blood test to confirm,25.05,4.95
that and take my blood Sugar's before,27.45,4.26
and after each meal,30.0,5.79
and after that I had to change like my,31.71,6.059
diet and my lifestyle because it does,35.79,4.86
affect the baby I had a growth scam and,37.769,5.581
the baby's growth it came to shore up so,40.65,4.71
that's why the tasted microRNA I was a,43.35,4.11
bit of a short because obviously it was,45.36,4.379
the very end of my pregnancy and then I,47.46,4.739
had to do these like wasted changes and,49.739,5.271
but I hear exercise a little bit and,52.199,5.25
change a diet then you can control it,55.01,4.899
yourself and I was put on medication for,57.449,4.231
the remainder of my pregnancy,59.909,4.551
um but again that was under control and,61.68,4.92
they keep oh good morning to turn on,64.46,4.96
year and I was induced at there to nine,66.6,6.15
weeks and she's here safe and sound,69.42,5.6
you can still breastfeed if you like and,72.75,5.4
yeah um I've got to have an annual blood,75.02,6.099
sugar test at my GP and there's risks of,78.15,5.7
type 2 diabetes in later life but as,81.119,4.32
long as you just keep doing what you're,83.85,4.619
doing then you should be okay so as a,85.439,4.86
positive experience if you can make it,88.469,4.171
one um and the staff have been really,90.299,6.93
good so six weeks after and the baby's,92.64,7.38
born and I have another blood sugar test,97.229,4.68
which will tell me if it's completely,100.02,3.629
gone because once you've delivered your,101.909,4.981
baby in the it's the placenta and that,103.649,5.46
that's where the disease sort of common,106.89,7.35
strong so one Sam that's going then it,109.109,10.89
should be okay so once baby's born and,114.24,7.229
the next day you have a fasting blood,119.999,3.811
sugar in the morning and that was that,121.469,4.53
was fame for me luckily so that means I,123.81,2.879
was all good to go,125.999,5.131
and the baby has blood sugar test after,126.689,7.111
the first two feeds which again we're,131.13,4.65
good so although we have to take your,133.8,3.45
blood sugars like before and after each,135.78,3.75
meal you get used to it you get quicker,137.25,5.88
at it as like easy once you start doing,139.53,4.08
it and,143.13,3.27
you get into a routine just like you're,143.61,3.93
going to get into routine we have your,146.4,2.22
baby so,147.54,9.36
