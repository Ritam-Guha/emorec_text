"Let me show you more about the Roux-en-Y surgery
that we perform.",38.43,3.269
"To gain access to the abdominal
cavity, small incisions are created on the",41.699,4.93

"The surgeon observes the abdominal cavity
using a laparoscope, or video camera.",61.309,7.831

device.",69.14,10.66
"The small intestine is separated into two
sections, the lower portion of the small intestine",79.8,8.41
is attached to the newly created stomach pouch.,88.21,3.79
"This allows food to pass directly into the
small intestine where digestion continues.",92.0,5.78

"The average human stomach can expand to hold

"During a sleeve gastectomy, a thin vertical
sleeve is created by using a stapling device.",159.25,6.54
"This sleeve will typically hold between 50
