so acromegaly as you know,2.399,4.4
is a disease that's caused by a growth,4.64,4.879
hormone secreting pituitary tumor,6.799,5.281
and it usually occurs in patients in the,9.519,4.881
middle of life like around their 30s or,12.08,4.32
40s but it can be diagnosed younger,14.4,4.16
which case people get to be giants if,16.4,2.799
they've,18.56,2.719
get it before their bones close at,19.199,3.041
puberty,21.279,2.721
or it can be very late in life and we,22.24,3.199
have some patients that are,24.0,3.599
elderly with acromegaly and diagnosed,25.439,3.041
even in,27.599,4.721
the eighth decade so it can be in men,28.48,5.84
it can be in women but the feature that,32.32,3.919
they all have is they all do have,34.32,4.8
excess growth hormone and the signs and,36.239,4.801
symptoms associated with that can be,39.12,2.4
growth,41.04,4.24
of the hands of the feet of the head,41.52,5.44
they can get facial changes with,45.28,3.04
thickening of their lips,46.96,3.759
and their tongue and their nose so even,48.32,4.239
after a person stops growing because,50.719,2.961
they've gone through puberty and they,52.559,2.32
won't get taller,53.68,3.6
they can still get growth of cartilage,54.879,3.441
and changes,57.28,2.959
in their facial features their hands and,58.32,3.28
their feet,60.239,2.8
a lot of patients won't know they have,61.6,3.36
this the changes are so slow,63.039,4.161
over a long period of time they may be,64.96,4.4
suffering from joint pain diabetes,67.2,3.12
hypertension,69.36,3.92
sleep apnea which are all comorbidities,70.32,4.24
of acromegaly,73.28,2.64
they don't know that they have the,74.56,3.84
disease until someone recognizes their,75.92,3.519
features,78.4,3.2
or they end up going to a doctor who,79.439,3.601
knows enough to put,81.6,3.36
pieces together and say ah let's test,83.04,3.2
you for acromegaly,84.96,3.28
most common um ways to present with,86.24,3.28
acromegaly,88.24,3.519
are growth of the hands and feet so,89.52,3.599
actual changes,91.759,4.881
headaches or incidental meaning they're,93.119,5.441
meeting up with someone from a medical,96.64,4.0
professional team,98.56,3.68
unrelated to their acromegaly but,100.64,3.2
someone identifies their features so,102.24,3.199
those are the most fascinating cases and,103.84,3.919
we have some great examples for example,105.439,5.68
of one of my colleagues who had,107.759,6.561
as a child live next door to a patient,111.119,3.521
who,114.32,2.32
went on to get acromegaly but when he,114.64,4.159
was running for office 30 years later,116.64,4.56
she saw his picture in the newspaper,118.799,4.481
and said she was an endocrinologist and,121.2,3.68
said oh my god i grew up with this guy,123.28,2.799
he looks so different i know he has,124.88,3.2
afromedley she tested him he had it he,126.079,2.8
was cured,128.08,2.64
so that was a case where he didn't,128.879,3.761
present with any symptom at all,130.72,3.92
but some endocrinologist recognized his,132.64,4.0
features and knew to test for it we get,134.64,4.48
examples like that where physicians are,136.64,4.4
in an audience of an opera singer and,139.12,4.479
they recognize the facial features and,141.04,4.4
it's always a trick of what to say and,143.599,8.081
when to say it,145.44,6.24
