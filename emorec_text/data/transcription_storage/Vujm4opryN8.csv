"hey guys welcome to episode 7 of the
strength series these episodes are about",0.03,4.829
"gaining muscle and cutting fat,
specifically for guys. In this episode",4.859,4.41
"I'm going to talk about how to increase
your insulin sensitivity.  In the last",9.269,4.381
"episode I talked about insulin
resistance. If you're insulin resistant",13.65,4.049
"you're more likely to store any
carbohydrates you eat as fat. When you",17.699,4.051
"eat carbohydrates or a large portion of protein, that gets
broken down and glucose is released into",21.75,5.279
"the bloodstream. Your body needs to deal
with that so your pancreas is going to",27.029,4.201
"release insulin. You have receptors in
your muscle and fat cells and they're",31.23,4.829
"going to activate in the presence of
insulin and they're going to draw the",36.059,3.721
"glucose out of the bloodstream. When you
are having sugary foods or you're snacking",39.78,5.07
"throughout the day you're triggering
lots of these blood sugar spikes and",44.85,3.99
"that's going to release insulin every
single time. Eventually your receptors",48.84,4.289
"become less responsive to insulin so
your pancreas needs to release more to deal",53.129,4.741
"with the same amount of glucose.
If you're insulin resistant you release 5",57.87,5.189
"to 7 times as much insulin as a regular
person would. Why is that a problem? Well",63.059,5.431
"that's a problem because ""In the presence
of any insulin all fat burning hormones",68.49,5.82
"are shut down"". When you eat carbohydrates
your body is switching off fat-burning",74.31,5.07
"mode in order to deal with the food that
you just ate. Your goal is to be more",79.38,4.379
"sensitive to insulin because we're
talking about those receptors in your",83.759,3.511
"body. You want them to jump into action
at the smallest release of insulin. So",87.27,4.77
"that is true whether you're trying to
gain muscle or lose fat that's because",92.04,4.079
"as well as keeping you burning fat by
controlling your insulin you can also",96.119,3.871
"help build muscle more effectively. So
with that in mind here are 15 ways to",99.99,4.919
"increase your insulin sensitivity
starting today. Number one: stop eating",104.909,4.591
"six times a day. It's fine if you're
having a moderate dose of protein and",109.5,4.14
"maybe some healthy fats but if you're
having a banana mid morning then insulin",113.64,3.869
"is being released. Two: avoid sugary drinks. 
Around half of the sugar in things like",117.509,5.101
"Coke and Pepsi as well as sports drinks
is fructose. That is a fruit sugar and can",122.61,5.489
"only be dealt with by the liver. In too
high a dose it will interfere with",128.099,3.901
"insulin signaling
and cause fat storage. Three: limit your",132.0,3.96
"fruits. As I said we want to manage
fructose. In order to improve your",135.96,3.96
"insulin sensitivity it's a good idea to
cut down on high fructose fruits like",139.92,4.32
"bananas and apples as well as most dried
fruits. A limit of 1 to 2 pieces a day is",144.24,5.91
"said to be effective. Four: avoid
sweeteners. Just because there's zero",150.15,3.75
"calories doesn't mean they can't trigger
insulin. This study showed a 20% increase",153.9,5.1
"in insulin when someone consumed a drink
with artificial sweeteners in it",159.0,4.14
"compared to water when taken with the
meal. So it's best to stick with water",163.14,4.8
"and avoid diet drinks particularly at meal
times. Five: reduce your body fat. This is",167.94,5.16
"particularly true if you're obese as
you're likely already storing the carbs",173.1,3.6
"that you eat as body fat. If you follow a
lower carb diet you should be able to",176.7,4.38
"bring your body fat percentage down to a
healthy range. If you are 25% body fat or",181.08,5.19
"above you can follow a diet of 50 grams
or less of carbohydrate a day in order",186.27,5.4
"to lose weight. If you're carrying a bit
of extra weight you could limit your",191.67,3.66
"carbs to 150 or 200 grams and also make
sure to put them either at breakfast",195.33,5.189
time or around your workout. Six: exercise. Muscle consumes the majority of the,200.519,5.431
"glucose in your blood so doing intense
exercise like weight lifting or high",205.95,4.38
"intensity interval training is a very
effective way of improving sensitivity.",210.33,4.08
"Charles Poliquin said that if you
increase muscle mass by 10 percent you",214.41,4.079
"can expect to improve the way that you
handle your carbohydrates by around 11",218.489,3.931
"percent. Seven: get enough sleep. Studies have
shown that a single night of poor sleep",222.42,4.56
"can contribute to insulin resistance. Eight:
increase your fibre intake. This will",226.98,5.039
"slow down digestion and the release of
sugar into the bloodstream from the gut",232.019,3.811
"The best sources of fibre are
vegetables. Nine: avoid trans fats. Trans fats",235.83,5.64
"are used to extend shelf life and can
to be found in certain biscuits cakes",241.47,3.69
"and pastries . They move your insulin
sensitivity in the wrong direction and",245.16,4.5
"will promote belly fat. Ten: improve your
omega-6 to 3 ratio.",249.66,5.13
"I covered Omega 6 in my health series I
put the link in the description below. In",254.79,4.199
"a typical Western diet our ratio is 16
to 1 whereas ideally we would want 4 to",258.989,5.071
"1 or less. Omega 6 is found in
a lot of cooking oils nuts and nearly",264.06,4.82
"all processed foods. Omega-3 could be
taken as a supplement or better still",268.88,4.92
"make sure you get several portions of
wild salmon a week as well as a portion",273.8,4.29
"of the other oily fish like mackerel and
sardines. Eleven: get more magnesium.",278.09,5.06
"Studies have shown that increasing
magnesium will improve sensitivity.",283.15,3.84
"You'll get it in leafy greens like
spinach as well as foods like pumpkin",286.99,4.36
"and sesame seeds. You can also take a
supplement I take ""ZMA"" before bed",291.35,4.47
"which is zinc and magnesium. Twelve:
drink some green tea. Green tea has been",295.82,4.59
"shown to improve the uptake of glucose
into muscle and reduce the uptake into",300.41,4.68
"body fat. Thirteen: there are things you can add
to your food to balance blood sugar.",305.09,4.17
"Cinnamon is great for lowering the spike
in your blood sugar levels. Remember that",309.26,4.59
"is something like ground cinnamon not
Cinnamon Grahams. Other foods",313.85,4.71
"that help include sauerkraut, apple cider
vinegar, tumeric and walnuts. Eat these",318.56,5.88
"with your high carb meals for a more
sustained release of energy. Fourteen: when",324.44,4.74
"dealing with protein try to avoid
combining with sugar instead try to",329.18,4.26
"combine it with some healthy fats as the
addition of fat will buffer the release",333.44,3.93
"of insulin. Finally fifteen: be aware that a
large portion of protein can also",337.37,4.71
"trigger an insulin release. I think a
good Max is around 50 grams of protein",342.08,4.83
"in a single meal. The better you stick to
these guidelines the sooner you can",346.91,3.93
"restore your insulin sensitivity. If you
think you might be insulin resistant you",350.84,4.05
"can check out a great video by dr. Berg
which I put in the description below. To",354.89,5.22
"steal from his checklist symptoms of
chronically elevated insulin levels",360.11,3.57
"include belly fat swollen ankles a
strong craving for carbs feeling like",363.68,6.21
"you need to nap after each meal and
brain fog. That's it for today, in the",369.89,4.77
"next episode I'm going to cover good
food sources for gaining muscle or",374.66,3.81
losing fat. Thanks for watching!,378.47,3.77
