well i think,2.48,3.279
in most cases we first want to assess,3.12,4.239
the tumor and and see if this is,5.759,4.241
amenable to surgical resection,7.359,4.801
smaller tumors like microadenomas that,10.0,3.84
are less than a centimeter,12.16,3.84
uh there's more likelihood of a cure,13.84,3.199
unfortunately,16.0,3.199
about two-thirds of these patients have,17.039,3.681
very large tumors,19.199,3.201
more than a centimeter and some of them,20.72,3.6
can be very invasive,22.4,4.16
and so surgical cure cannot always be,24.32,3.6
attained but,26.56,3.44
certainly in many cases we do try to,27.92,3.279
debulk the tumor,30.0,4.32
and provide some amount of growth,31.199,4.321
hormone control,34.32,2.96
and then after that we have to consider,35.52,3.68
if that patient would be,37.28,4.56
a candidate for radiotherapy or if we,39.2,5.6
should try medical therapy,41.84,4.64
you know radiotherapy has its own,44.8,3.36
problems in the sense that it,46.48,4.8
takes uh years for that to take effect,48.16,5.84
so even if you see that a patient would,51.28,5.279
benefit from that we still have to,54.0,5.52
control the disease in the meantime and,56.559,4.881
also radiotherapy can lead to some,59.52,3.84
issues with,61.44,2.999
[Music],63.36,3.68
hypopituitarism where now the rest of,64.439,5.481
the pituitary can also be damaged and so,67.04,5.36
oftentimes we will move on to a medical,69.92,5.44
therapy to control this disease,72.4,6.16
we really have two,75.36,5.84
uh approved medications to treat,78.56,3.52
acromegaly,81.2,3.04
the first are somatostatin receptor,82.08,3.359
ligands,84.24,3.199
which bind to a receptor on the surface,85.439,3.281
of the tumor,87.439,4.401
and that turns down growth hormone,88.72,4.24
secretion,91.84,3.12
it can also cause shrinkage of the tumor,92.96,4.56
so it can lead to better tumor control,94.96,6.32
and it does that by leading to apoptosis,97.52,5.76
of some of those cells,101.28,4.72
we have a second therapy which is a,103.28,5.119
growth hormone receptor antagonist,106.0,4.96
that requires daily injections and that,108.399,4.961
decreases the igf-1 production from the,110.96,3.439
liver,113.36,2.96
the major problem with these symptoms,114.399,3.121
and signs,116.32,3.36
however it doesn't lead to tumor control,117.52,3.84
because it's not targeted at the tumor,119.68,2.079
level,121.36,1.92
it's targeted at the growth hormone,121.759,8.081
receptor level in the tissues,123.28,6.56
