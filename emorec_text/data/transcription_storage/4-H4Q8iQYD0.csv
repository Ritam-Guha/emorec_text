it really allows me to like let out a,196.72,3.519
lot of aggression you know it's kind of,198.319,3.601
therapeutic once you find the rhythm,200.239,3.121
of just like you know picking the ball,201.92,3.76
up stretching out,203.36,3.92
and just like you know throwing it down,205.68,3.04
to the ground as hard as you can,207.28,3.039
you know over and over and over again,208.72,3.28
you really start to find a rhythm and,210.319,4.241
and it just uh i don't know feels good,212.0,3.12
just getting,214.56,4.239
getting that out last station of the,215.12,4.24
circuit,218.799,2.321

of process or before i start my day,285.12,4.32
you know planning the things that i want,287.759,3.921
