thirty million people in the United,0.0,3.36
States have diabetes the vast majority,1.56,4.38
of them have type 2 diabetes some of,3.36,4.439
those are testing their blood sugar at,5.94,4.05
home but the best research is telling us,7.799,3.96
that they don't need do that in fact,9.99,3.72
it's a waste of money it's not a small,11.759,4.05
problem the waste is running into the,13.71,4.23
billions of dollars and it's costing all,15.809,3.451
of us money through the healthcare,17.94,3.599
system that's the topic of this week's,19.26,10.8
healthcare triage for people with type 1,21.539,10.77
diabetes blood glucose monitoring and,30.06,4.53
insulin administration is the standard,32.309,4.261
of care patients need to check their,34.59,3.989
blood sugar multiple times a day then,36.57,4.02
give themselves insulin to replace what,38.579,3.171
would have been made in the pancreas,40.59,3.809
treatment for type 2 diabetes however,41.75,4.51
doesn't involve these critical,44.399,3.66
calculations of insulin it's usually,46.26,3.27
maintained with pretty regular,48.059,3.301
administration of the same drugs on a,49.53,3.9
set schedule self-monitoring for blood,51.36,5.1
glucose therefore may be unnecessary for,53.43,5.28
those not on insulin this has been,56.46,4.349
tested in well-designed studies the,58.71,3.899
monitor trial published two years ago in,60.809,3.93
JAMA internal medicine was a pragmatic,62.609,4.561
trial that took place in 15 primary care,64.739,4.74
practices in North Carolina patients,67.17,4.559
with type 2 non insulin treated diabetes,69.479,3.811
were randomly assigned to one of three,71.729,3.871
groups people in the first group were,73.29,4.079
told to check their blood glucose once a,75.6,4.32
day people in the second were told to,77.369,4.201
check their blood glucose once a day and,79.92,3.269
then they were given tailored advice,81.57,3.27
depending on the results from the meter,83.189,4.411
the third group was told not to check,84.84,5.099
their blood sugar at all after one year,87.6,4.08
which is a pretty impressive length for,89.939,3.421
a study like this there were no,91.68,4.259
differences in the hemoglobin a1c levels,93.36,4.02
which is the best way to monitor,95.939,3.72
long-term blood glucose control between,97.38,3.779
the three groups there were also no,99.659,2.67
differences in the health-related,101.159,2.85
quality of life measures for the,102.329,3.33
patients there were no differences in,104.009,3.031
the number of times they experience,105.659,3.39
hypoglycemia how much care they needed,107.04,3.93
and how many progressed to the need for,109.049,4.32
insulin in other words there were no,110.97,4.2
measurable differences in how patients,113.369,3.811
fared whether they check blood sugar or,115.17,4.11
not this evidence while the best to date,117.18,5.06
confirm what previous work had shown a,119.28,5.909
2012 Cochrane review assessed all the,122.24,4.36
randomized controlled trials through,125.189,4.261
2011 that had investigated how testing,126.6,4.409
for blood glucose at home improved,129.45,4.5
outcomes it included 12 trials,131.009,6.031
involving more than 3200 patients by 12,133.95,5.16
months the overall benefit to testing,137.04,3.87
with respect to lab values was,139.11,4.62
statistically insignificant there were,140.91,4.86
never any benefits with respect to,143.73,4.56
patient satisfaction still not everyone,145.77,4.92
is on board critics of this most recent,148.29,4.02
trial said it didn't prove that blood,150.69,4.14
glucose monitoring couldn't help it's,152.31,4.83
possible to with better training or more,154.83,4.44
attention to detail there might be ways,157.14,4.11
to make it work the point of pragmatic,159.27,3.33
comparative effectiveness trials though,161.25,3.09
which we've covered in previous episodes,162.6,4.08
is to test how practices work in the,164.34,5.28
real world in these high-quality primary,166.68,5.67
care practices even with customized help,169.62,4.53
in interpreting the measurements which,172.35,4.41
is more than most patients get testing,174.15,3.899
blood sugar didn't make a difference,176.76,3.42
choosing wisely we've covered it before,178.049,4.561
is an educational campaign aiming to,180.18,4.29
reduce unnecessary medical tests and,182.61,4.349
procedures and it advises against,184.47,4.68
routine home glucose monitoring for,186.959,4.231
patients with type 2 diabetes who are,189.15,4.2
not on insulin it says that there is no,191.19,4.56
benefit admit there are potential harms,193.35,3.99
like an association with increased,195.75,3.45
anxiety this argument is supported by,197.34,3.209
the American Academy of Family,199.2,3.36
Physicians the Society of general,200.549,3.901
internal medicine and The Endocrine,202.56,3.84
Society of course there are exceptions,204.45,3.87
when patients are acutely ill or,206.4,3.66
changing regimens or finding that their,208.32,2.93
blood sugar is not well controlled,210.06,3.54
testing may be appropriate such,211.25,4.299
decisions should be made in consultation,213.6,4.62
with a physician but for most people,215.549,4.681
with type 2 diabetes not an insulin,218.22,4.62
testing is inappropriate most of the,220.23,5.22
time that message is not getting through,222.84,5.22
at the end of last year another study,225.45,3.87
was published in JAMA internal medicine,228.06,3.149
that quantified the prevalence of,229.32,4.199
glucose testing and adults researchers,231.209,4.201
examined a database that contain data on,233.519,3.121
more than three hundred and seventy,235.41,3.21
thousand commercial health insurance and,236.64,4.14
Medicare Advantage beneficiaries who had,238.62,4.619
type 2 diabetes of the more than 23,240.78,3.72
percent of patients who were using,243.239,3.601
testing strips more than half were,244.5,4.44
probably doing so in spite of widespread,246.84,3.959
recommendations that they should not,248.94,4.799
they were using a median of two testing,250.799,4.861
strips a day at a cost of more than,253.739,3.03
three hundred and twenty-five dollars,255.66,4.109
per year per patient on another front,256.769,4.861
the New York Times and other places have,259.769,3.421
reported that a surprisingly large,261.63,3.9
number of people who use insulin,263.19,4.95
are using less because they can't afford,265.53,5.52
it putting themselves in danger with a,268.14,4.65
healthcare system as complicated as ours,271.05,3.72
it's hard to take money from one pot and,272.79,4.35
shifted easily to another efficiency and,274.77,4.74
each system is crucial the fact that a,277.14,4.56
necessary facet of diabetes care is,279.51,4.05
increasingly out of reach,281.7,4.14
while unnecessary and potentially,283.56,4.28
harmful care is easily overused,285.84,4.62
illustrates how much work still needs to,287.84,2.95
be done,290.46,2.67
