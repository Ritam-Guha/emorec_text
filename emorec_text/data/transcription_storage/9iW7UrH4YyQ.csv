yeah so almost all cases with acromegaly,2.32,4.479
are due to a pituitary tumor,4.88,4.24
it's usually a macroadenoma meaning a,6.799,4.081
tumor that's greater than one centimeter,9.12,4.0
as opposed to a microadenoma which is a,10.88,4.4
pituitary tumor less than one centimeter,13.12,4.079
both cases are possible even rare cases,15.28,3.52
of no tumor seen because it's so small,17.199,3.201
you can't find it on the mri,18.8,3.2
the vast majority of patients with,20.4,4.16
acromegaly have a macroadenoma and that,22.0,4.48
will be seen on the mri,24.56,4.4
and that is a pituitary tumor that looks,26.48,5.36
like a lesion there or a mass lesion,28.96,5.92
that is over producing an over secreting,31.84,5.44
growth hormone causing this disease,34.88,4.32
almost all patients will have a growth,37.28,4.24
hormone secreting pituitary adenoma,39.2,5.039
as the cause for their acromegaly there,41.52,5.359
are very rare situations,44.239,4.8
where there are alternate causes of,46.879,3.441
acromegaly,49.039,2.961
and those are patients that have what we,50.32,4.719
call ectopic secretion of growth hormone,52.0,6.239
that can be from a tumor somewhere else,55.039,3.921
that makes,58.239,3.921
growth hormone or a tumor somewhere else,58.96,5.839
that makes growth hormone releasing,62.16,3.279
hormone,64.799,2.881
ghrh which is the stimulator for growth,65.439,3.121
hormone,67.68,4.72
they're both very uncommon although ghrh,68.56,5.68
secretion as an ectopic source of,72.4,2.88
acromegaly,74.24,4.48
is more likely than ectopic gh,75.28,6.159
secretion but in either case you you,78.72,3.439
would have no,81.439,3.521
pituitary tumor but you would have an,82.159,4.721
excess of growth hormone or,84.96,4.56
its stimulator ghrh coming from another,86.88,9.12
tumor source,89.52,6.48
