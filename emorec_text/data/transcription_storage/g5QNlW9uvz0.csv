common thing worldwide,16.4,4.719
this can come from accidents injuries on,18.8,4.639
the muscles and nerves it can come from,21.119,6.08

many many many patients,59.76,5.52
i have found that the b vitamins can do,62.0,6.88
miracles for many of your problems,65.28,6.64
now the reason why i say the b vitamins,68.88,4.16

than just b1 b6 or b12 those are the,82.0,7.68
three main vitamins that they found,86.96,5.199
that are directly tied into neuropathy,89.68,4.64
but here is the problem if you are,92.159,4.561
deficient in any other b vitamin because,94.32,5.759
of poor diet excessive stress,96.72,6.079
these vitamins all work together,100.079,5.601
by taking a good b complex and usually,102.799,6.64
