- So what are artificial sweeteners?,8.95,2.25
"They are essentially
additives type products",11.2,3.1
"that are sweet in nature,
but do not have sugar",14.3,3.06
or calories in them.,17.36,1.07
"So are often used as substitutes
for high sugar drinks",18.43,3.25
for other food products.,21.68,1.216
(upbeat music),22.896,2.583
Do artificial sweeteners come in a variety,26.42,2.64
of brands and types?,29.06,2.06
"They do taste differently
but some of them are bitter",31.12,2.59
and are often mixed with other sweeteners,33.71,1.99
to make them taste better for people.,35.7,1.935
(upbeat music),37.635,2.905
"It's really hard to study
artificial sweeteners",40.54,2.34
and know if they lead to weight loss.,42.88,2.5
"In general, data suggests
that it might be helpful",45.38,3.72
in lowering calories and sugar intake,49.1,2.32
"if you're switching from high sugar foods,",51.42,2.7
"to foods that are sweetened
with artificial sweeteners",54.12,2.46
"because they're lower
in calories and sugar.",56.58,2.25
"However, there are no
great long-term studies",58.83,3.1
that show that artificial sweeteners,61.93,1.91
actually help people lose weight.,63.84,1.648
(upbeat music),65.488,3.262
"In general, though they
are not healthy appetite",68.75,2.65
suppressants and don't usually,71.4,2.41
affect your other food choices.,73.81,1.686
(upbeat music),75.496,2.394
"There's no data that suggests
that they're good for you.",77.89,2.55
"The question is, are they bad
for you or are they neutral?",80.44,4.1
My opinion is that they're probably better,84.54,2.06
than high sugar drinks.,86.6,1.26
So if you're replacing a diet soda,87.86,3.34
"instead of a regular soda,",91.2,2.14
they're of potentially health benefits,93.34,1.6
because the regular soda has so much sugar,94.94,2.21
and calories in it.,97.15,1.56
"But if you're somebody
who's already drinking water",98.71,3.14
"or herbal tea, I don't
think switching to any type",101.85,3.27
of diet beverage offers any benefit.,105.12,2.911
(upbeat music),108.031,2.583
I usually recommend people,111.97,1.387
"who are currently consuming
foods that are high in sugar,",113.357,3.283
"especially juice or soda,",116.64,1.95
"try to switch to artificially
sweetened soda or juice",118.59,4.82
if they do not wanna switch,123.41,1.45
to completely unsweetened beverages,124.86,1.77
"which is water, black
coffee, or herbal tea.",126.63,3.5
"Eventually though, I
think for ideal health",130.13,2.42
"they would also limit their
consumption or their eating",132.55,3.41
of diet products as well.,135.96,2.34
So if somebody starting out,138.3,1.58
"by drinking two liters
per day of a diet soda,",139.88,2.78
which a lot of people who do that,142.66,2.21
I recommend trying to limit that,144.87,1.89
"to one liter a day for a
few weeks or few months.",146.76,2.68
"Yes, eventually they can
sort of wean themselves down.",149.44,3.126
(upbeat music),152.566,2.844
Artificial sweeteners can worsen headache.,155.41,2.483
They might be related to seizures,158.88,3.05
and they may affect your mood.,161.93,1.72
Though I usually recommend limiting them,163.65,2.51
"in people who suffer from
migraine or mood disorders",166.16,3.48
"or who have a history
of seizure disorders.",169.64,1.954
(upbeat music),171.594,3.026
I don't think anyone can say,174.62,2.02
"with 100% certainty,
artificial are bad for you,",176.64,3.98
or that they're good for you.,180.62,1.47
"I don't think any data
shows they're good for you.",182.09,2.43
They might be bad for you,184.52,1.65
"but I believe they are better
than full sugar option.",186.17,3.911
(upbeat music),190.081,2.583
