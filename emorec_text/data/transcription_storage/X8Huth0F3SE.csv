[Music],1.34,6.999
you,19.83,2.06
well this is a study looking at,25.37,3.99
pioglitazone which is a,27.95,3.87
thiazolidinedione and our notion was to,29.36,5.16
use this drug before patients develop,31.82,4.26
diabetes because we were convinced that,34.52,3.99
this drug had anti atherosclerosis,36.08,5.52
"so recruited nearly 4,000 patients with",38.51,5.79
recent TI a or stroke randomized them to,41.6,4.47
pioglitazone or placebo and follow them,44.3,3.93
for about four or five years and what we,46.07,5.73
found was a 24% risk reduction in future,48.23,5.759
Mir stroke I think this study confirms,51.8,3.78
what we thought all along that,53.989,4.59
pioglitazone this thiazolidinedione has,55.58,7.159
potent anti-authority effects,58.579,4.16
you,68.92,2.059
so pioglitazone a thiazolidinedione is,72.65,6.33
an insulin sensitizing drug and it has,75.53,5.31
protein effects on multiple,78.98,4.02
cardiovascular risk factors obviously,80.84,5.01
insulin resistance will improve glucose,83.0,5.52
levels drop a few points as does blood,85.85,4.8
pressure there are beneficial effects on,88.52,5.25
certain lipid parameters and CRP levels,90.65,5.49
a marker of inflammation also is reduced,93.77,5.28
it's still not clear exactly which of,96.14,6.12
those mechanisms actually translates to,99.05,5.19
the cardiovascular benefits at this,102.26,3.66
meeting we presented a mediation,104.24,3.3
analysis where we tried to determine,105.92,4.71
which of the individual risk factor,107.54,5.37
benefits from pioglitazone actually,110.63,4.44
mediated the effect and we couldn't find,112.91,5.4
a single change in any of these,115.07,6.12
covariates that translated to the,118.31,6.0
benefit HDL cholesterol increases by a,121.19,5.55
few points and that seemed to mediate,124.31,5.25
about 25% of the risk reduction and,126.74,4.8
there were minor contributions from,129.56,4.41
blood pressure and triglycerides glucose,131.54,5.28
as well as CRP and as a composite when,133.97,4.32
we put all of these Cove areas together,136.82,3.78
we could explain about 50% of the,138.29,5.37
benefit but still the majority of the,140.6,6.38
benefit remains undisclosed,143.66,3.32
you,153.21,2.06
well here I think the data are more,156.83,3.8
clear again this is an insulin,158.66,4.23
sensitizing drug and it's been,160.63,4.45
demonstrated in previous trials to,162.89,4.77
reduce the progression from pre-diabetes,165.08,3.69
to diabetes,167.66,3.63
so in iris we showed that in this,168.77,4.28
insulin resistant cohort of patients,171.29,5.1
there was greater than a 50% reduction,173.05,6.76
in the progression to diabetes most of,176.39,5.22
the benefit actually occurred in those,179.81,3.87
patients that already had pre-diabetes,181.61,5.28
so the sense here is that by reducing in,183.68,5.61
some resistance offloading the beta cell,186.89,7.13
you will lead to less diabetes over time,189.29,4.73
you,200.5,2.06
so pioglitazone first of all is not,203.67,4.44
marketed in the United States for either,205.77,4.62
insulin resistance or pre-diabetes it's,208.11,3.84
only on the market for patients with,210.39,3.09
diabetes so this was really an,211.95,4.71
exploratory investigation the question,213.48,6.03
is can it be extrapolated to other T CDs,216.66,5.36
first of all pioglitazone is the only,219.51,4.98
tzd in the United States that's widely,222.02,5.14
prescribed rosiglitazone had some,224.49,4.41
controversy a number of years ago and,227.16,3.51
while it's still available is,228.9,5.07
essentially rarely prescribed I will say,230.67,5.789
that when investigators have looked at,233.97,4.44
the comparative benefits between,236.459,3.271
pioglitazone and rosiglitazone,238.41,4.85
pioglitazone always seems to have some,239.73,5.94
advantage over rosiglitazone whether,243.26,4.36
it's based on cardiovascular risk and,245.67,4.71
diabetes patients or on lipid parameters,247.62,4.17
so I would say that we cannot,250.38,3.37
extrapolate to any tzd,251.79,9.999
