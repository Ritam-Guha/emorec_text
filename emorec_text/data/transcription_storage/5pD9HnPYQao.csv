hey guys today we're gonna talk about,0.03,5.249
hypoglycemia should you increase or,1.38,6.9
should you decrease your carbohydrates,5.279,4.501
alright what are the symptoms of,8.28,6.08
hypoglycemia shakiness nervousness dizzy,9.78,9.06
hungry cravings and your irritable other,14.36,6.1
than that you're perfectly fine now what,18.84,3.63
you need to know about hypoglycemia is,20.46,5.25
this it's the high insulin that's,22.47,6.149
lowering the blood sugar yes it's true,25.71,4.95
that your adrenals or your liver might,28.619,5.1
be weak and it goes back down but it is,30.66,5.309
the high levels of insulin that is,33.719,4.86
pushing the blood sugar down because the,35.969,5.281
purpose of insulin is to lower blood,38.579,5.701
sugar when the insulin is high it lowers,41.25,5.899
the blood sugar when the insulin is low,44.28,5.549
and will your blood sugar will go higher,47.149,4.84
okay it goes out of control so in,49.829,5.521
diabetes type 1 where you don't make any,51.989,5.191
insulin you're gonna have high blood,55.35,3.9
sugar and this is why persons put on,57.18,4.98
medication usually insulin now over here,59.25,5.129
type 2 it's a little different you,62.16,4.74
actually have high levels of insulin and,64.379,4.591
type 2 but because you have insulin,66.9,5.34
resistance it makes it appear like you,68.97,6.0
have a low insulin okay inside the cell,72.24,4.8
so it's basically of all this insulin,74.97,3.899
but it's not working alright so now,77.04,3.45
let's talk about the recommendations,78.869,4.651
that you normally get from the medical,80.49,5.64
community which I believe is very very,83.52,5.43
bad advice so you get this,86.13,5.07
recommendation to increase your protein,88.95,6.0
okay what they don't emphasize is to,91.2,6.45
lower the carbohydrates and they,94.95,4.739
definitely don't emphasize to increase,97.65,4.89
the fat now take a look at this the real,99.689,6.151
root cause of hypoglycemia is high,102.54,6.869
insulin adding more carbs is going to,105.84,5.4
increase insulin we don't want to do,109.409,5.011
that adding more protein will increase,111.24,7.14
some insulin okay adding more fat is the,114.42,5.4
only thing that's not going to increase,118.38,3.66
the insulin now it's okay to consume,119.82,5.28
protein but only if you are on a,122.04,6.48
low-carb diet because when you increase,125.1,7.859
protein with carbs you more than double,128.52,5.299
the in,132.959,2.931
response you also get this condition,133.819,3.631
called glycation where you're actually,135.89,3.989
combining a protein with a sugar,137.45,4.439
molecule okay and that's really bad in,139.879,3.87
the body and what's even worse than that,141.889,4.141
is they're also recommending the six,143.749,4.71
meals a day to eat very frequently to,146.03,4.739
prevent the drop in blood sugar and all,148.459,3.81
that will do is just continue the,150.769,2.731
problem so you'll never be able to,152.269,3.36
correct it so here's what you should do,153.5,2.879
okay,155.629,3.03
realize that it's the high insulin,156.379,5.131
causing the problem and by the way it's,158.659,5.851
totally okay to consume protein just go,161.51,4.83
with lower carbs okay,164.51,4.649
increase your fat fat is going to help,166.34,5.97
you go longer without getting hungry fat,169.159,5.31
will help stabilize the blood sugars fat,172.31,3.799
is not going to worsen the situation,174.469,4.531
okay so we want to do a little more,176.109,4.99
protein a little more fat you can do,179.0,5.01
vegetable carbohydrates but keep all the,181.099,5.28
other carbohydrates low and watch all,184.01,4.259
the improvements that will occur with,186.379,4.771
your hypoglycemia so if you've,188.269,4.381
personally benefited from the,191.15,3.239
