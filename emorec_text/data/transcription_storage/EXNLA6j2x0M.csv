my name is st√©phanie apt and today we're,0.03,5.13
going to discuss the difference between,2.939,5.311
Medicare supplement plans and Medicare,5.16,8.16
Advantage plans so there are two main,8.25,7.32
parts to Original Medicare Part A and,13.32,4.379
Part B and that will be right there on,15.57,3.66
your red white and blue Medicare card,17.699,4.261
Part A which is your hospital coverage,19.23,4.469
is usually free as long as you've been,21.96,3.87
working in the United States for ten,23.699,6.0
years Part B which is your doctor or,25.83,7.499
your medical coverage most people pay a,29.699,6.661
monthly premium for so most people pay a,33.329,5.16
standard monthly premium with one,36.36,3.57
hundred and thirty four dollars per,38.489,5.281
month is the standard premium in 2017 to,39.93,7.83
be on Medicare Part B now once you have,43.77,6.84
Medicare Part A and Part B you have two,47.76,5.4
main choices on how you can get your,50.61,5.64
coverage so the first choice or option,53.16,6.239
one is to keep your Original Medicare,56.25,5.34
benefits Part A and B that you're,59.399,4.531
receiving through the government and,61.59,4.95
then from there add on a Medicare Part D,63.93,5.28
drug plan which will cover your,66.54,4.95
prescription medications and then most,69.21,5.22
people add on a Medicare supplement or a,71.49,5.94
Medigap plan and those plans are,74.43,5.34
designed to work right along with your,77.43,4.68
Original Medicare benefits of Part A and,79.77,5.58
B and pay the gaps so those meta gap,82.11,6.06
plans or Medicare supplement plans pay,85.35,6.18
the deductibles and coinsurance that,88.17,6.51
Original Medicare doesn't pay so this,91.53,5.729
first option that you have this first,94.68,5.46
path allows you a lot of freedom right,97.259,4.32
because you're going with Original,100.14,3.45
Medicare so you have the freedom to pick,101.579,4.021
your own doctors and hospitals and,103.59,5.01
usually you pay very little to nothing,105.6,6.0
at the doctor or hospital because the,108.6,5.129
Medigap or Medicare supplement plans are,111.6,5.1
designed to fill in the gaps they pay,113.729,5.25
the deductibles the coinsurance so that,116.7,4.32
you're responsible for very little,118.979,4.17
out-of-pocket if you do get sick if you,121.02,3.419
go to the doctor if you go to the,123.149,5.011
hospital now the other option or option,124.439,6.801
number two is to go with a med,128.16,6.23
your advantage plan so what is a,131.24,5.19
Medicare Advantage plan well it's,134.39,3.15
important to know that Medicare,136.43,3.15
Advantage plans are not Original,137.54,5.13
Medicare so while you still will be,139.58,4.95
paying your Medicare Part B premium,142.67,3.99
you're gonna have to pay that no matter,144.53,5.04
what option you choose right you're,146.66,4.2
gonna still be paying that one hundred,149.57,3.98
and thirty-four standard Part B premium,150.86,6.0
Medicare Advantage plans are managed,153.55,4.72
healthcare plans,156.86,2.79
administered by private insurance,158.27,3.75
companies so if you choose to do a,159.65,3.9
Medicare Advantage plan,162.02,3.96
you're now receiving the benefits of,163.55,6.48
Medicare Part A and B through a managed,165.98,6.54
health care plan administered by you,170.03,4.86
know Humana or United Healthcare,172.52,4.26
whatever insurance company are deciding,174.89,4.56
to go with so Medicare Advantage plans,176.78,4.44
work a little bit differently with a,179.45,4.05
Medicare Advantage plan you typically,181.22,4.86
have more limitations on the doctors and,183.5,4.68
the hospitals that you can use with some,186.08,3.69
plans you're gonna need referrals to see,188.18,3.78
a specialist usually the plans don't,189.77,4.83
travel with you so there is going to be,191.96,5.52
more limitations there also you'll,194.6,5.76
generally pay more out-of-pocket if you,197.48,6.42
use the plan most plans have deductibles,200.36,7.32
co-pays coinsurance and usually the,203.9,5.16
finish line there the out-of-pocket,207.68,3.69
maximum is between five and seven,209.06,4.5
thousand dollars annually that you would,211.37,4.89
be responsible for now the upside of,213.56,4.92
these plans are that they are low cost,216.26,4.95
some of them are you know free or zero,218.48,4.92
dollars a month and then they you know,221.21,4.05
go up from there depending on the type,223.4,4.41
of plan that you choose and usually your,225.26,4.32
drug coverage is included right there in,227.81,3.57
the plan so that's some of the benefits,229.58,3.27
of doing one of these all in one,231.38,4.05
Medicare Advantage plans the downsides,232.85,3.93
are going to be you know more,235.43,3.42
limitations on doctors and hospitals,236.78,4.59
plan not traveling with you and paying,238.85,4.38
more out-of-pocket if you do get sick or,241.37,5.49
use the plan so in a nutshell those are,243.23,6.18
some of the differences between Medicare,246.86,5.4
supplement and all-in-one Medicare,249.41,5.64
Advantage plans and it's just important,252.26,5.64
to know the ins and outs of both options,255.05,5.82
so that you can make the best decision,257.9,6.42
for yourself for your lifestyle and for,260.87,5.25
