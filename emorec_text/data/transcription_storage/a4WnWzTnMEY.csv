hey so today we're going to talk about,0.03,3.84
intermittent fasting and diabetes is it,1.53,5.099
safe is it dangerous should you do it,3.87,6.059
well if you actually pull up on Google,6.629,5.751
data on this you're going to see that,9.929,5.58
certain articles and videos will say,12.38,5.409
it's not good to do this there's other,15.509,4.44
diets that are better because they're,17.789,3.601
trying to avoid something called,19.949,4.561
hypoglycemia this really dangerous side,21.39,6.299
effect but let's just take a look at the,24.51,5.16
whole picture okay first of all what is,27.689,2.611
diabetes,29.67,4.319
it's hyperglycemia it's high sugar okay,30.3,6.96
hypoglycemia is low blood sugar the,33.989,5.401
purpose of the medication that a,37.26,5.22
diabetic takes is to lower blood sugars,39.39,6.3
and as one complication of this,42.48,5.16
sometimes the medication can drive the,45.69,4.02
blood sugars to low and you end up with,47.64,3.93
hypoglycemia and so they give you these,49.71,3.84
little sugar pill especially if you're a,51.57,6.149
type 1 diabetic now when you do,53.55,6.3
intermittent fasting you basically,57.719,4.89
decrease the need for insulin okay you,59.85,5.91
decrease the need for medication for,62.609,5.251
diabetics now if you actually continue,65.76,5.31
to take the same medication okay and do,67.86,5.79
in a minute fasting at the same time you,71.07,3.96
are going to have problems because it's,73.65,2.64
going to drive your blood Sugar's too,75.03,6.18
low but the goal I would think which,76.29,7.32
makes total logical sense is to be able,81.21,5.76
to decrease the need for medication,83.61,5.61
right without make sense decrease the,86.97,6.149
need for metformin for insulin and other,89.22,5.67
diabetic medications that would be a,93.119,3.93
good thing because even insulin has side,94.89,4.26
effects when you take too much insulin,97.049,4.14
and by the way the insulin that a,99.15,5.19
diabetic is taking is not the same as,101.189,5.401
your body is supposed to produce it's a,104.34,4.4
genetically modified version of your own,106.59,4.26
insulin and that's a whole other topic,108.74,4.12
but the point is that there are side,110.85,4.799
effects from taking too much insulin,112.86,5.219
okay even if it's regulating your blood,115.649,5.01
sugars I mean look it up yourself I'll,118.079,4.381
put a link down below so you you can see,120.659,3.901
this but when a diabetic type one for,122.46,2.6
example,124.56,3.559
consumes a large carbohydrate meal,125.06,5.71
they're gonna need more insulin to deal,128.119,4.061
with that excessive car,130.77,3.719
right but they don't consume as many,132.18,4.52
carbs they're gonna need less insulin,134.489,4.711
when you do in a minute fasting the,136.7,4.899
Nitra insulin goes down now the question,139.2,3.33
is it dangerous,141.599,3.12
well it's only dangerous if number one,142.53,4.95
you don't do it gradually and you don't,144.719,4.711
adjust your medication you don't get,147.48,3.929
help from your doctor to make those,149.43,4.199
adjustments with the quantity of,151.409,4.321
medication so when you're doing in a,153.629,3.48
minute fasting and you're eating less,155.73,3.81
carbs the need for this medication goes,157.109,5.041
down make the adjustments you'll have,159.54,4.83
you won't get hypoglycemia now your,162.15,4.259
blood Sugar's will come down but you're,164.37,3.36
not going to feel bad because you're,166.409,2.881
gonna actually your body's gonna be,167.73,5.039
running on ketones and fat fuel and less,169.29,5.25
blood sugars so even if your blood,172.769,4.2
sugars are let's say for example 70 or,174.54,4.83
even 60 and you're feeling fine,176.969,4.02
so you really have to look at the whole,179.37,3.209
picture and understand what's happening,180.989,3.991
and not just kind of think with high,182.579,4.38
blood sugar and low blood sugar so in,184.98,4.08
reality intermittent fasting is not only,186.959,4.291
an essential part of healing the,189.06,5.129
pancreas but giving you the potential to,191.25,5.699
come off your medications of course with,194.189,5.101
the help of your doctor all right I'll,196.949,4.931
