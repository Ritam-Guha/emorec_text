let's talk about why some diabetics get,0.06,5.58
gangrene okay and others don't first of,2.82,4.8
all what is gangrene it really has,5.64,5.039
nothing to do with the color green but,7.62,5.46
when you get gangrene the tissue usually,10.679,4.5
in the feet or the toes start first and,13.08,4.26
then sometimes in the hand start turning,15.179,5.341
black yellow red and even kind of a,17.34,3.93
shade of green,20.52,2.97
now the actual word gangrene comes from,21.27,4.56
the Latin word which means putrefaction,23.49,5.16
dead or dying tissue and the reason why,25.83,4.769
the tissue is dying is simply because,28.65,4.56
you're exposing the tissue with way too,30.599,5.011
much sugar okay so if your blood sugar,33.21,5.369
is too high that sugar goes to the,35.61,4.59
vascular system and the tiny little,38.579,4.111
blood vessels especially starting in the,40.2,4.879
toes and sometimes in the hands because,42.69,5.04
you start off from the heart with larger,45.079,4.151
blood vessels and then it gets down to,47.73,3.69
the bottom of the feet to the tiny,49.23,4.29
capillaries then it comes back through,51.42,4.17
the venous system but when you expose,53.52,5.519
glucose to your vascular system you get,55.59,5.719
all sorts of destruction you get massive,59.039,5.931
oxidation creates free radicals,61.309,5.591
hemorrhaging so you're getting bleeding,64.97,5.38
getting clotting the the vascular system,66.9,5.85
is becoming thicker and stiffer and,70.35,4.67
you're getting a healing response,72.75,4.68
inflammatory response and all of this is,75.02,4.389
going to stop the blood flow to the,77.43,5.79
tissues and to the nerves now the lining,79.409,6.741
on the inside of the vascular system is,83.22,6.24
called the endothelial layer and this,86.15,7.24
layer does not require insulin to,89.46,8.07
transport glucose into those cells which,93.39,5.88
means that if you have insulin,97.53,4.65
resistance you won't have any resistance,99.27,6.029
there if there's too much glucose it's,102.18,5.189
going to drive it right into the tissues,105.299,3.39
and that's really what's creating the,107.369,3.631
damage if you look at insulin resistance,108.689,4.47
as a protective mechanism to block,111.0,4.229
insulin and glucose from going in the,113.159,4.32
tissues because it's toxic large amounts,115.229,5.07
and there's certain tissues that don't,117.479,4.951
require insulin and those usually get,120.299,4.381
hammered okay the brain cells for,122.43,4.259
example don't require insulin you have,124.68,4.889
the brain blood barrier which does but,126.689,5.011
not the actual brain cells the red blood,129.569,4.111
cells don't require insulin,131.7,3.45
this is why when you get a test with,133.68,4.44
called a1c they're measuring the amount,135.15,6.3
of exposure of that sugar to the red,138.12,5.339
blood cell to determine if you're a,141.45,4.5
diabetic or not so the more sugar in the,143.459,5.011
blood the more vascular problems you're,145.95,5.009
gonna have and that's gonna stop the,148.47,6.12
nutrition to the tissues and the oxygen,150.959,4.681
to the tissues,154.59,2.729
and it's gonna start dying and that's,155.64,3.81
what's called gangrene so you have a,157.319,4.771
combination of dead tissue ulcers and,159.45,5.069
severe nerve damage a lot of times,162.09,4.319
there's pain involved until the nerve is,164.519,3.3
dead and then you have no pain it's,166.409,3.061
completely numb now what could be done,167.819,3.54
for this condition well the most,169.47,4.349
important thing is to avoid this in the,171.359,6.061
first place by not consuming so much,173.819,6.87
sugar okay doing Kido and I have so you,177.42,5.7
never end up in the situation but if you,180.689,4.621
already have this situation there might,183.12,3.6
be a couple things that you can do,185.31,4.17
depending on how severe it is let's say,186.72,4.26
you don't want to get surgery and remove,189.48,3.24
your toes okay and maybe you have,190.98,3.33
certain tissues that are not so bad,192.72,4.079
maybe you have an ulcer or some,194.31,7.679
infection well guess what the FDA did,196.799,9.27
approve in 2004 maggot therapy and I'm,201.989,6.03
not I'm not being sarcastic they,206.069,5.161
actually put maggots in the ulcer to,208.019,6.541
clean up the dead tissue certain types,211.23,5.64
of maggots eat the dead tissue and they,214.56,4.289
don't eat the healthy tissue so they,216.87,4.5
clear out the infection interesting in,218.849,5.67
fact they're finding that it's even more,221.37,5.64
effective than certain surgeries because,224.519,4.89
it disinfects the area and it stimulates,227.01,5.339
healing and within one or two days it,229.409,4.83
could be totally cleaned out so these,232.349,4.11
maggots actually release enzymes and,234.239,5.541
they also release like a broad-spectrum,236.459,6.21
antibiotic to kill HUF the infection is,239.78,4.989
quite interesting but of course you,242.669,4.38
would want to make sure that you change,244.769,4.56
your diet so you don't keep exposing,247.049,5.101
these tissues to glucose you don't want,249.329,4.951
to just rely on medication to control,252.15,4.38
your blood sugars medication basically,254.28,5.009
takes the excess blood sugar and in it,256.53,3.81
has to put it somewhere it doesn't,259.289,3.6
evaporate it lowers it but it puts it,260.34,5.25
somewhere in the in the tissues but we,262.889,4.051
want to actually eliminate the sugar,265.59,2.31
from the,266.94,2.9
the other thing that I would recommend,267.9,4.26
especially if you're getting let's say,269.84,3.73
you're getting nerve damage but maybe,272.16,4.2
it's not gangrene yet is to start taking,273.57,6.21
benfotiamine but in folk too mean is a B,276.36,6.24
vitamin that is made into a fat soluble,279.78,5.7
version so it penetrates the myelin,282.6,5.49
sheath it goes right into the nerves and,285.48,5.28
actually can help to protect against the,288.09,4.95
high sugar and the complications and,290.76,4.2
it's great for peripheral neuropathy,293.04,3.21
it's called benfotiamine,294.96,4.47
get some take like four tablets a day,296.25,5.58
spread out and you'll see some really,299.43,4.71
wonderful changes with that anyway I,301.83,4.38
wanted to create this video to explain,304.14,5.88
