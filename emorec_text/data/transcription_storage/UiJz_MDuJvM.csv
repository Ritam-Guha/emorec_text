when I first got diagnosed with,0.06,5.4
end-stage renal disease I was a student,2.429,7.201
in medical school I was in the UK doing,5.46,8.52
clinical rotations when I started to,9.63,7.89
show signs and symptoms in a situation,13.98,6.469
where Dallas is not available,17.52,6.45
then I would have things like vomiting,20.449,8.801
diarrhea fatigue lethargy if it gets,23.97,7.44
really bad meaning that I do not get,29.25,4.32
dialysis for an extended period of time,31.41,4.89
I have had situations where I had,33.57,4.739
seizures,36.3,6.15
I had a read Mia when my potassium built,38.309,4.861
up too high,42.45,3.15
I had black holes I had to end up in the,43.17,6.06
ICU on three occasions well currently we,45.6,5.639
only have one hemodialysis units in,49.23,5.309
Grenada which is privately run and I,51.239,6.331
mean hemodialysis is a very expensive,54.539,6.801
procedure it's expensive to maintain and,57.57,6.72
the optimum treatment would be three,61.34,7.84
times a week but because of cost I would,64.29,10.77
only do twice a week you can survive but,69.18,8.15
you're not as strong as you could be,75.06,4.26
there is an alternative to the,77.33,4.66
modalities which is peritoneal dialysis,79.32,4.83
the peritoneal dialysis is a little,81.99,5.309
cheaper and it's more convenient in that,84.15,5.579
you can do it at home where I saw the,87.299,4.351
hemodialysis you would have to take time,89.729,4.35
out of your schedule to go to the unit,91.65,4.53
to sit there for three to four hours to,94.079,4.981
get treatment patients who have CVA,96.18,5.36
heart problems,99.06,4.47
hemodialysis might not be the best,101.54,3.759
treatment for them because it puts a lot,103.53,4.47
of pressure on your heart whereas,105.299,5.911
patients who have polycystic kidney,108.0,5.97
disease with very large cysts or,111.21,4.61
patients who might be pregnant or,113.97,5.999
patients who are like very large in,115.82,6.189
terms of size who might not have a lot,119.969,4.68
of abdominal space they might not be,122.009,4.021
able to accommodate the peritoneal,124.649,3.571
dialysis so it's a matter of knowing the,126.03,5.009
patient and then getting to choose what,128.22,5.58
is the best option for them because,131.039,6.811
the cost of dialysis it's very difficult,133.8,8.37
for the average Canadian to our food so,137.85,6.75
if we can get more in terms of,142.17,5.28
subsidizing costs making treatment work,144.6,5.7
readily available it would be a lot,147.45,6.9
better for the Grenadian public I am NOT,150.3,6.54
going to say government need to have,154.35,5.85
their own dialysis per se but at least,156.84,4.95
if we had dialysis available at the,160.2,4.02
hospital so patients who are,161.79,6.0
hospitalized don't have to get into an,164.22,5.43
ambulance to get drop-top senticles,167.79,3.36
needs to get repairs I don't have to get,169.65,3.24
collected to come back we need social,171.15,5.1
and psychological support because it's,172.89,6.0
it can be a lot to deal with and even,176.25,5.16
for the family members it can be a lot,178.89,3.15
to do it,181.41,2.34
because there was two occasions when my,182.04,5.46
son had to be the one to find me passed,183.75,7.11
out and call ambulance to come get me,187.5,7.2
that was traumatic for him I think,190.86,7.47
education is going to play an important,194.7,7.74
role in and once people get to know that,198.33,6.629
this is what is happening then they,202.44,5.13
would understand better because,204.959,4.801
sometimes you hear persons wanting to,207.57,5.1
give you advice about what herbs to take,209.76,7.5
and stuff like that but there's a,212.67,7.05
difference between keep the problems and,217.26,6.3
and stitch we're now seeing it once,219.72,6.239
everybody is well educated,223.56,5.31
we don't you realize that having TB,225.959,5.461
disease is just like having any other,228.87,6.03
disease once you get your treatment you,231.42,5.88
can live with it a diabetic once you get,234.9,4.98
the incident they can't evoke a normal,237.3,7.05
life they can continue working so it's,239.88,6.09
same thing with kidney disease once,244.35,5.34
treatment is available then you can you,245.97,6.29
can live with it,249.69,2.57
