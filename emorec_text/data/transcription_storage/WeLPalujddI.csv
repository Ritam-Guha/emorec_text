there are two things that diabetic,0.03,5.999
patients tend to develop with diabetic,2.1,6.72
retinopathy one is swelling and one is,6.029,5.581
bleeding and swelling is a general sort,8.82,5.52
of collection of fluid in the retina,11.61,4.83
which affects central vision,14.34,5.34
now most people develop it slowly and,16.44,5.339
they start to struggle with things like,19.68,4.95
reading they notice a bit of blur to the,21.779,4.83
side of the vision it interferes with,24.63,4.649
their computer work they start to notice,26.609,4.68
that but they tend to adapt no if it,29.279,4.011
affects both eyes they can get quite,31.289,4.591
incapacitated to struggle with their,33.29,5.53
computer work staring at screens makes,35.88,5.82
it much harder to do for longer periods,38.82,4.309
and the struggle with right reading,41.7,4.679
actually written words on text and,43.129,7.601
newspapers and documents if they have,46.379,7.261
treatment they tend to improve quite,50.73,5.61
significantly and get back to doing all,53.64,5.489
of that stuff pretty quickly but again,56.34,5.129
it's a course of treatment with the,59.129,3.961
people who have bleeds in the back of,61.469,5.371
the eye of those that rare minority they,63.09,5.069
need a course of treatment it takes a,66.84,4.08
lot longer to recover so that process is,68.159,5.64
gradual and also the anxiety that they,70.92,5.82
come to me with a nervousness takes time,73.799,4.89
to improve because I'm not giving them,76.74,5.879
an instant treatment fix and over a,78.689,6.691
course of time most of those patients,82.619,6.241
will see again very well and they'll,85.38,5.849
kind of forget that they had poor vision,88.86,4.35
at the beginning that a gradual,91.229,4.201
improvement it's not a sudden thing they,93.21,3.939
notice and wake up,95.43,4.119
and said no my vision's got better but,97.149,4.47
it's a gradual improvement but those,99.549,3.901
patients ultimately are very grateful,101.619,4.35
because they understand that if that,103.45,4.11
intervention hadn't occurred at that,105.969,3.75
point the consequences could have been,107.56,3.36
much worse,109.719,12.311
