"Hi this doctor Tarrin P. Lupo and today
we're going to talk",0.51,3.31
"about Polycystic Ovary Syndrome or
PCOS",3.82,4.69
Dr. Tarrin P. Lupo,8.51,7.0
"Let's talk about Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,",18.24,3.04
"To understand it you first have to
understand how",21.49,3.129
"ovaries are normally supposed to work.
What happens",24.619,3.841
"is as you develop eggs they actually
come to the surface",28.46,3.59
"of the ovary via a cyst, so multiple
cysts will develope",32.05,5.349
"at one time inside an ovary. The dominant
cyst",37.399,4.881
"or the one that grows the most will
actually be the one to pop in release an egg.",42.28,4.36
"All the rest so this this that develop
come straight back down and get",46.82,4.66
reabsorbed into the ovary.,51.48,1.44
"During polycystic ovary syndrome
something goes wrong.",52.92,4.209
"Those cysts that are supposed to get
reabsorbed don't.",57.129,4.141
"Although they don't release eggs they
still form all over the ovaries",61.27,4.3
you get multiple cysts. These cysts,65.57,4.119
"then go on to produce extra hormones
that shouldn't be there",69.689,4.201
and this causes most to the symptomology,73.89,3.61
"of polycystic ovary syndrome. The
ultimate reason this happens",77.5,4.909
"is actually kinda surprising, it's a
sugar regulation problem",82.409,4.111
People who are insulin-resistant or have,86.52,3.04
"insulin surges, develop PCOS.",89.56,3.47
"Insulin resistance is kinda fancy way of
saying your pre-diabetic or you're about",93.03,6.25
to develop diabetes.,99.28,1.54
"You can no longer regulate blood sugar
correctly.",100.82,3.799
Most insulin resistance happens,104.619,3.75
due to a lifetime up a bad diet.,108.369,3.061
"things like eating too much meat, fat",111.43,3.46
",oils and especially refined
carbohydrates",114.89,3.47
"can set this in motion.  The insulin
resistance",118.36,4.399
"actually wreaks havoc on your hormonal
system",122.759,4.281
especially and enzyme called,127.04,2.749
1720 lyase.  This will promote,129.789,4.051
"testosterone production where you
shouldn't really be making it.",133.84,6.19
This rise in testosterone is a problem,140.03,3.06
"but what also happens are the cells on
the ovaries, the theca cells,",143.09,3.84
they also produce too much estrogen too.,146.93,4.15
"This causes a weird mix up symptoms at
present",151.08,3.32
"in PCOS patients.  Sometimes they'll end
up growing hair when they're not",154.4,4.74
supposed to grow hair,159.14,1.14
"or they'll get adult cystic Acne.  The
other issues",160.28,3.7
"is they have a real problems with
carrying a baby.  Infertility is the main reason",163.98,4.72
"PCOS is such a problem. Insulin
resistance",168.82,4.44
"is the ultimate cause of all these
problems not only that",173.26,4.009
"but the surges in insulin and
testosterone",177.269,3.891
"create a vicious negative feedback loop
and will",181.16,3.47
"perpetuate the insulin resistance.  It
also",184.63,3.359
"causes thyroid problems. Later on you
can develop autoimmune thyroid problems,",187.989,5.231
with this condition. One of the sad things,193.22,3.799
"is some women spend fortunes trying to
get pregnant carry a baby",197.019,4.861
in never have PCOS,201.88,3.24
actually regulated or managed.,205.12,3.14
"This is the the main reason women have
infertility problems and they can't carry a child.",208.26,4.06
Ultimately it's because their diet.,212.5,4.24
"PCOS is really affected by insulin surges and
you're kinda see two presentations with this.",216.96,5.1
"You'll see people who are insulin
resistance and you'll see the other side",222.18,5.2
"of the coin,",227.38,1.01
people who are hypoglycemic.,228.39,3.34
"a good way to tell the difference is
usually look at the body",231.73,3.46
"most to the people who are insulin
resistant have very stubborn weight they",235.19,4.18
can't get rid of.,239.37,1.03
"On the other side the coin you'll see
hypoglycemics who are usually skinny PCOS's,",240.4,5.559
and often misdiagnosed.,245.98,4.22
"Also, one last thing about PCOS a lot of women",250.2,4.03
get problems with their menstrual cycle,254.23,3.469
"so they either have irregular periods,
very long painful periods",257.699,3.891
"or they don't even have periods at all
when they get stressed out.",261.59,3.94
So there are natural ways,265.72,2.02
to manage this.  This is really,268.14,2.72
"about controlling insulin resistance,  you
want to use the same diet",270.86,4.76
"a diabetic would use in order to reduce
your acne,",275.62,3.78
"your facial hair, your infertility and
your",279.4,4.079
"menstrual problems.  if you adopt that
kind of diet where you reduce your meat",283.479,5.24
"oil, and especially your refined",288.719,3.23
sugars you'll see a vast improvement.,291.949,4.641
"ultimately a plant-based diet is going to be the
best direction to go for this condition",296.59,4.699
"So just stay on top your diet if you
want to manage your PCOS.",301.289,5.87
"Also if you found this video useful
please give it a thumbs up,",307.159,3.921
"and share it out, I always appreciate
that!  Stick around and check out my next story,",311.08,4.91
"on joint pain we'll talk about natural
management",316.26,4.8
of inflammation and joint pain.,321.069,4.14
