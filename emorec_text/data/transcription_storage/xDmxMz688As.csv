about how good exercise can be few,2.429,6.0

is that it's not just vigorous aerobic,8.429,4.891
exercise that improves your mental,11.09,4.089
health it's any kind of physical,13.32,4.379
activity at all that's really good news,15.179,4.291
if you're depressed and anxious there's,17.699,3.361
not too many depressed and anxious,19.47,3.36
people are able to motivate themselves,21.06,4.68
to exercise but many will be able to put,22.83,5.4
just a little more activity in their day,25.74,4.289
when you're thinking about increasing,28.23,3.869
your physical activity to improve your,30.029,4.351
psychological well-being there are some,32.099,5.521
important things to remember number one,34.38,5.67
is that you won't keep doing it or even,37.62,4.59
start doing it for that matter if you,40.05,5.55
don't enjoy it choose something you like,42.21,5.52
doing to ensure that you will be a,45.6,4.709
little more motivated to do it and to,47.73,5.46
continue to do it regularly secondly,50.309,7.14
don't start with a marathon start just,53.19,6.36
by being a little bit more active than,57.449,4.171
you are now with the future doing a,59.55,4.77
little bit more later on if you're doing,61.62,5.789
absolutely nothing try some stretches in,64.32,5.07
the morning or walking to the letterbox,67.409,5.511
to check the mail every little bit helps,69.39,6.39
just plan to do a little bit more than,72.92,5.55
you're doing now and do it regularly,75.78,5.94
thirdly be physically active with,78.47,5.5
someone else for company if that helps,81.72,5.25
you do it it often makes the activity so,83.97,5.399
much more enjoyable and you can hold,86.97,5.219
each other to task make sure you write,89.369,5.671
your plan down in detail including the,92.189,4.68
fallback position if something gets in,95.04,3.48
the way,96.869,3.811
don't forget to set a review date for,98.52,4.02
the plan when you'll consider whether,100.68,3.899
what you're doing is enough or you would,102.54,3.3
like to do some more,104.579,3.511
don't worry yes about whether it's,105.84,4.559
improving your mental health or not that,108.09,5.37
will sneak up on you over time just try,110.399,5.311
to enjoy the activity for its own sake,113.46,5.31
it's not a bad idea before you do this,115.71,5.31
with your patients to try making an,118.77,4.26
activity plan for yourself,121.02,6.919
