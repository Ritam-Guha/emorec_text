we're here to talk about the,6.03,3.92
in people with type 2 diabetes and today,10.01,5.1
at the ad a we,12.83,5.24
our largest trial on a investigational,15.11,5.37
hepatitis B vaccine that we just,18.07,4.18
completed the trial and we presented our,20.48,5.059
immunogenicity and safety,22.25,3.289
the CDC actually has looked,26.71,5.31
that and they determined through their,28.99,4.77
studies that people with type 2 diabetes,32.02,5.52
are twice as likely to get hepatitis B,33.76,7.619
and it's mostly exposure is that folks,37.54,7.08
with type type 2 diabetes are have a lot,41.379,5.241
of exposure to medical equipment and,44.62,5.43
obviously blood you know blood sticks,46.62,5.5
for example and that equipment can be,50.05,6.0
invisibly contaminated and the hepatitis,52.12,5.99
B virus is remarkably stable,56.05,4.71
environmentally stable and it's 100,58.11,6.449
times more infectious than HIV,60.76,3.799
certainly if they develop hepatitis than,65.659,3.691
they you know that they they would need,67.909,4.32
to have specialist care of course to,69.35,4.439
deal it particularly to develop acute,72.229,4.051
hepatitis or any of the sequelae of,73.789,4.47
hepatitis B infection which,76.28,3.689
unfortunately aren't very you know,78.259,3.86
they're cirrhosis and hepatocellular,79.969,4.981
carcinoma cancer so obviously would,82.119,4.331
require treatment the most important,84.95,5.3
thing is to prevent it by far,86.45,3.8
so the global research as we evaluated,91.06,4.48
this investigational hepatitis B vaccine,93.5,5.13
called helpless ave and the goal was,95.54,4.56
there was to determine the,98.63,4.59
immunogenicity and safety in a,100.1,5.04
population of type the people type 2,103.22,4.22
diabetes,105.14,2.3
for the immunogenicity results we showed,108.67,7.949
that people in a study we showed that,112.09,6.84
the serial protection rate for people,116.619,4.201
who received helpless at was ninety,118.93,5.61
percent versus 65.1 percent for the,120.82,5.939
active comparator which was an existing,124.54,5.189
hepatitis B vaccine index being that,126.759,4.381
difference of twenty four point nine,129.729,3.601
percent was statistically significant,131.14,5.16
and then on the safety side we studied,133.33,5.85
safety of course in over eight thousand,136.3,6.03
trial participants and the rates of,139.18,4.8
adverse events serious adverse events,142.33,4.82
and deaths were similar between the two,143.98,6.63
vaccine arm any adverse events were,147.15,4.869
considerably immune-related were,150.61,3.72
evaluated by an independent and blinded,152.019,4.111
safety evaluation and June occation,154.33,5.01
committee or siak tough acronym and they,156.13,4.5
found that none of those events were,159.34,4.82
related to vaccination,160.63,3.53
I think one of the big advantages a,165.46,4.77
helpless happy I suppose is that because,167.98,4.44
of this adjutant that we're using we,170.23,3.9
have a special whole like receptor nine,172.42,4.17
agonist as an adjuvant in the vaccine we,174.13,5.31
use the standard surface antigen Plus,176.59,6.69
this adjuvant this allows the vaccine to,179.44,5.82
be administered in two doses over one,183.28,3.96
month existing vaccines are three doses,185.26,5.64
over six months and we know that people,187.24,6.42
have a difficult time getting all three,190.9,5.37
doses in fact the CDC's vaccine safety,193.66,5.85
data link study showed that only fifty,196.27,7.68
four percent of people who start the,199.51,5.82
three dose regimen complete it within a,203.95,3.59
year,205.33,2.21
happens that B is specifically for,208.9,5.309
hepatitis B prevention in adults not it,211.06,5.31
will be more than just the the more than,214.209,5.071
just people with diabetes but this is a,216.37,4.5
diabetes meeting and that was the focus,219.28,3.799
of today the reasons is that it the,220.87,4.979
hepatitis B remains a public and,223.079,4.27
important public health problem and,225.849,4.47
"challenge there's about 20,000",227.349,5.31
infections every year and we do immunize,230.319,3.691
children and have been doing that,232.659,4.08
regularly since 1991 but there still is,234.01,5.849
this is you know a nun significant,236.739,5.041
number of cases every year and it's and,239.859,4.581
it is preventable,241.78,2.66
well the indication that we're pursuing,245.68,7.14
is for all adults 18 and above and in,248.45,7.26
the we and as I mentioned we do have,252.82,5.1
this data in people with type 2 diabetes,255.71,4.589
which is important because of the,257.92,4.54
increased risk that these people have,260.299,6.811
and current rates of coverage for people,262.46,7.62
with type 2 diabetes for hepatitis B is,267.11,6.38
pretty lowest only twenty-three percent,270.08,3.41
according to our data no to this vaccine,275.31,7.06
the response rates it appears to be,278.38,6.09
similar sorry summer to what we see in a,282.37,4.139
population of the who have people who,284.47,4.52
don't have diabetes,286.509,2.481
we have filed an application a biologics,290.729,3.87
license application with the Food and,293.4,4.379
Drug Administration and we have a Purdue,294.599,8.03
fat date of fifteen december this year,297.779,4.85
I think the most important things it,304.16,3.72
gives physicians like myself who deal,305.9,3.33
with people type 2 diabetes another,307.88,3.48
option to help prevent hepatitis B just,309.23,3.18
the importance of people getting,311.36,2.85
immunized and protecting themselves to,312.41,4.83
vaccine preventable disease and I dealt,314.21,5.04
with a lot of people with type 2,317.24,4.26
diabetes and and other diseases and if,319.25,4.53
we can prevent a disease with a vaccine,321.5,5.21
that's a really good thing,323.78,2.93
I think the most important thing is to,327.849,3.511
listen to those people and people have,329.74,3.209
concerns carefully and then present them,331.36,3.239
with the data as we understand it and,332.949,3.661
they can make their own decisions but I,334.599,3.3
think they should understand the data,336.61,3.569
and the opportunity to prevent disease,337.899,5.181
is really important,340.179,2.901
