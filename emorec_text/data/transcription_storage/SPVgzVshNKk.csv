"Diabetes is still the leading
cause of blindness in adults.",5.906,3.99
"It's still the leading cause
of end stage renal disease.",10.046,2.96
And all of this is preventable.,13.466,2.29
That's Dr Irl Hirsch.,16.046,1.42
"He thinks earlier use of insulin could be one
way to prevent those complications and others.",17.766,5.15
"We feel that if the guidelines were more
amenable to starting insulin sooner,",23.536,6.55
"it could have a tremendous
public health benefit.",30.356,2.94
"Here's what the 2020 American Diabetes
Association guidelines currently recommend.",33.296,10.5
"All type 2 patients should
receive lifestyle education.",44.306,3.28
"Adding metformin is the recommended
first-line pharmacologic intervention.",47.976,4.13
"Then, if the patient has
cardiovascular or kidney comorbidities,",52.556,3.9
"the guidelines recommend adding a GLP-1
receptor agonist or SGLT2 inhibitor.",56.486,5.73
"If there are no such comorbidities, physicians
can prescribe drugs based on the risk",62.906,4.25
"for hypoglycemia, weight
management concerns, or drug cost.",67.156,3.95
"Dr Hirsch co-authored an article in JAMA
that suggests that after that first step,",72.196,4.66
"for patients whose HbA1c
is higher than 9 to 9.5%,",77.066,4.4
"clinicians should consider
prescribing basal insulin,",81.576,2.76
independent of any other considerations.,84.496,2.28
"The problem right now is, quite frankly,
if one says you should start a medication,",87.526,7.55
"whatever medication, at a level of 9, often
it won't be started until 9 1/2 or 10.",95.076,5.75
That's just the way it is.,101.416,1.51
"Having insulin on the mind of the physicians,
mostly primary care physicians, earlier,",103.346,5.53
"I think, again, over the course of time,
could have a dramatic public health impact.",109.386,6.15
"The authors base that recommendation
on a few lines of evidence.",115.746,4.65
"They cite a 2008 trial demonstrating
the benefit of intensive insulin therapy",120.876,4.59
"on beta-cell function and glycemic control in
patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes.",125.466,6.24
"They estimate based on UKPDS data that
reducing HbA1c from 9.5 to 8.5% can result",131.706,7.15
"in an absolute reduction of
microvascular disease by approximately 15%",138.856,4.56
and myocardial infarction by approximately 10%.,143.416,3.22
"And they also cite a systematic review in
which participants with HbA1c levels above 9",146.636,6.11
"who received insulin had greater reductions in
HbA1c than those who received noninsulin drugs.",152.746,5.96
"What's interesting about that study is that
when looking at lower A1C levels, the insulin",158.756,7.58
and the non-insulin therapies did the same.,166.336,2.2
"It's when you get to these higher A1C levels
above 8 1/2 and 9% that the insulin just did",169.186,7.3
so much better than the non-insulin therapies.,176.486,2.54
"But Dr Hirsch and his coauthor stress the
importance of lifestyle in diabetes control,",179.026,5.96
"despite their pitch for insulin
in type 2 patients.",185.136,3.35
"And anybody who is watching their blood
sugars, whether with finger sticks",188.486,4.28
"or continuous glucose monitoring,
which is we are using more and more,",193.076,3.61
"they realize that at the end of the day,
no matter what medications they are on,",196.686,6.0
"including insulin, what they eat and
how they exercise is really going",202.686,5.88
to dictate what their glucose control is.,208.566,8.72
