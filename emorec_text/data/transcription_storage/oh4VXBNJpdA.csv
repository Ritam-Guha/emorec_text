the oral glucose-tolerance test it's a,0.05,9.52
test where you drink a lot of sugar,5.7,6.54
water to figure out how your body reacts,9.57,5.939
to too much sugar basically I am going,12.24,4.77
to do this but I've been dreading this,15.509,4.11
I've been postponing this the idea is,17.01,4.56
eight ounces of water which is quarter,19.619,5.431
of leader and 75 grams of sugar now I,21.57,6.209
took honey and here's the water with the,25.05,7.259
honey I need to it's quite a lot and the,27.779,8.94
idea is to drink this in a short period,32.309,7.441
of time take a bleep plug on the glucose,36.719,4.801
and two hours later take your lip,39.75,17.879
glucose again see what happens and we're,41.52,18.23
done,57.629,2.121
pretest value 5.1 millimolar and,63.86,11.829
flatline is now 11:09 so i'm going to,70.909,9.941
drink and in two hours and past one i am,75.689,10.761
going to test again Cheers,80.85,5.6
actually it is pretty good good stuff,91.909,10.981
it's not scientific because it's honey,104.24,7.36
instead of sugar honey contains my 9%,107.43,6.439
sugar,111.6,2.269
you,120.9,7.55
that's it now we wait 1210 one hour in,122.539,8.821
let's see the results I haven't been,128.45,6.33
feeling too bad bit nauseous but little,131.36,5.459
bit whoa,134.78,7.53
and we have a rise 8.7 a quick rice this,136.819,7.621
is one hour and next test it's going to,142.31,5.399
be two hours see if I drop it down or it,144.44,6.54
rises even further then past one so it's,147.709,5.581
two hours and we're going to take,150.98,8.789
another measurement is it ah look it's,153.29,9.36
gonna peak and it's down but it's not,159.769,6.621
that far down I wonder what that means,162.65,8.91
ten past two three hours after my sugar,166.39,12.34
shot let's see what happened and we have,171.56,10.32
dropped down five point two it's about,178.73,8.49
the same level as it was before and it's,181.88,9.54
good that means no pre-diabetics no,187.22,6.0
nothing of course this is not the way,191.42,3.78
you're supposed to take tests the test,193.22,4.29
is supposed to go with sugar not honey,195.2,5.18
and the measurements needs to be,197.51,6.66
intravenous and not with a little needle,200.38,5.65
for the pinprick or anything like that,204.17,4.11
but this is not medical at all this was,206.03,5.789
just going to see what happens and now I,208.28,5.959
did,211.819,2.42
