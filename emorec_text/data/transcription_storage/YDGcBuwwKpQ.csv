hi guys welcome to another episode of,0.32,2.8
sugar md,2.32,4.479
today we are talking about beets,3.12,6.32
are beats good for diabetes i get this,6.799,3.121
question,9.44,2.88
frequently and i'll talk about that,9.92,3.28
today,12.32,2.56
i am dr ahmed ergin i'm an,13.2,3.68
endocrinologist and a diabetes education,14.88,3.04
specialist,16.88,4.559
and let's talk about beets,17.92,3.519
okay guys so beets are nice,24.16,5.6
and tasty not everybody likes them but,27.519,3.361
actually,29.76,4.319
they are like medicinal food,30.88,5.92
they do not necessarily help your,34.079,4.241
diabetes per se,36.8,3.599
but it helps a lot other things and i'll,38.32,4.079
tell you what they are,40.399,4.64
but let's talk about diabetes part first,42.399,3.68
now one cup of,45.039,4.961
raw beets are around 13 grams of carbs,46.079,6.48
and they have good amount of fiber so,50.0,3.44
you end up with,52.559,4.081
around nine grams of net carbs,53.44,5.599
which is not bad right so it's low in,56.64,3.52
calories,59.039,2.801
there's a great addition to your salad,60.16,3.92
some people even drink beet juice,61.84,5.12
but what is really important about beets,64.08,3.92
is,66.96,4.24
it is very good for your blood pressure,68.0,5.52
a significant blood pressure drop has,71.2,3.36
been seen,73.52,4.0
with beets and beet juice now the,74.56,4.48
beaches may have more,77.52,3.36
carbohydrates in it so you have to be,79.04,3.68
careful about how much you consume,80.88,4.96
but it is very high in folate and b,82.72,6.88
vitamins and very high in antioxidants,85.84,5.84
now one of the antioxidants is alpha,89.6,3.519
lipoic acid,91.68,3.92
which has been shown to reduce the nerve,93.119,4.881
damage in patients with diabetes,95.6,4.8
so it helps your blood pressure,98.0,3.6
reduction,100.4,2.96
and it helps with the nerve damage now,101.6,3.6
how does it do that there are,103.36,4.56
nitrates which are a derivative of,105.2,3.84
nitric oxide or,107.92,4.0
it leads to the creation of nitric oxide,109.04,6.079
and nitric oxide is a primary molecule,111.92,3.6
that,115.119,2.96
dilates your blood vessels and most of,115.52,4.559
us as we get older,118.079,4.241
and due to variety of other diseases,120.079,4.881
such as diabetes and insulin resistance,122.32,4.72
our blood vessels get stiffer and,124.96,3.439
stiffer and,127.04,4.16
we need some sort of dilators so that,128.399,4.801
the elasticity in your blood vessels,131.2,5.2
remain better and more like healthier,133.2,5.92
and nitric oxide is one of the things,136.4,4.24
that really help you,139.12,3.839
to achieve that as we get older nitric,140.64,3.44
oxide production,142.959,3.201
goes down due to problems like insulin,144.08,3.76
resistance it goes down,146.16,4.32
but the beets and beet juice really,147.84,3.92
helps to,150.48,3.759
regenerate that nitric oxide that you,151.76,3.119
need,154.239,2.801
in order to create that elasticity in,154.879,3.281
your arteries,157.04,3.839
up to eight to ten millimeter mercury,158.16,3.2
drop,160.879,3.601
in your blood pressure is achievable,161.36,5.2
when you incorporate the bees in your,164.48,4.64
diet as i said it's not very high in,166.56,4.64
carbs and it's a great addition to help,169.12,3.52
control your blood pressure,171.2,4.64
also if you continuously use it it,172.64,5.44
because of the alpha lipoic acid content,175.84,4.64
in it it will definitely help prevent,178.08,3.519
the nerve damage,180.48,4.24
as well again i like beets in my,181.599,6.0
salad most of the time and i think if,184.72,4.0
you haven't tried it,187.599,3.92
try that you will like that as well also,188.72,4.64
because of the nitric oxide,191.519,4.561
content people who are into exercise,193.36,3.2
which,196.08,2.4
you all should be entering your side at,196.56,4.08
this point right if you have diabetes,198.48,3.52
and watching this channel,200.64,3.84
but if you are having the problem of,202.0,4.879
getting tired easily and your exercise,204.48,4.319
capacity is not great,206.879,5.36
try beats beats will help you to improve,208.799,5.201
your exercise capacity as well because,212.239,3.201
when you exercise,214.0,4.56
your muscles need that blood flow,215.44,5.2
and if your blood vessels like we,218.56,3.52
discuss is not opening,220.64,5.28
up then you will have the fatigue so,222.08,6.079
try that i think your exercise capacity,225.92,3.52
will improve as well,228.159,4.321
