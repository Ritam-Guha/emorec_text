"so today i'm going to talk about the huge problem 
with the glycemic index it gives you some data  ",0.24,6.4
"and so if you're only relying on the glycemic 
index you're going to set yourself up for a lot  ",6.64,5.04
"of failure because it only tells you a small part 
of the big picture so the glycemic index covers  ",11.68,7.92
"a range of foods on a scale that rates a food's 
ability to raise your blood glucose so on the  ",19.6,7.04
"glycemic index a food less than 55 would be 
considered low and so this is based on using 50  ",26.64,7.2
"grams of absorbable carbs so you're minusing the 
fiber even though that's a carb it doesn't have an  ",33.84,8.32
"effect on insulin a twix candy bar is considered 
low on the glycemic index pizza hut supreme pie is  ",42.16,11.04
"considered low on the glycemic index betty 
crocker chocolate cake is considered low  ",53.2,5.12
"and a hundred percent stone ground whole wheat 
bread is considered low so right off the bat  ",58.88,6.4
"the glycemic index is not based on real world 
serving size consumption all right the next point  ",65.28,7.28
"people never eat just one food on the scale for 
example are you just going to eat a piece of bread  ",73.2,8.0
"no you're going to put something on 
it like peanut butter and jelly right  ",81.2,4.24
"or some meat and cheese number three when you're 
combining protein or fat with a sugar or something  ",85.44,8.16
"that turns into sugar pretty quickly you create 
something called advanced glycated end products  ",93.6,7.12
"which is a type of protein that ends up not 
being used in the body but it clogs everything up  ",100.72,6.4
"it destroys your vascular system it destroys 
your vision your circulation your neurons in  ",107.12,9.28
"your brain so this is just one additional negative 
effect of glucose when it's combined with protein  ",116.4,8.24
"or fat all right number four low glycemic 
fructose is worse than glucose so on the scale  ",125.36,8.24
"at 100 which is considered high you have glucose 
and then when we get into the lower part we have  ",134.72,5.36
"a type of sugar called fructose which is only 
19 which is very low on the glycemic index and  ",140.08,6.48
"then if we combine fructose with glucose we get 
sucrose and that's why it's about right here but  ",146.56,7.12
"here's the big problem the receptors in your body 
for glucose are pretty much all over the body the  ",153.68,8.56
"receptors for fructose are only in your liver so 
when you consume fructose you're creating a lot  ",162.24,7.44
"of damage to the liver because you're not able to 
spread out this sugar evenly throughout the body  ",169.68,8.24
"it's more concentrated right to the liver 
and so the liver has to deal with it  ",178.48,3.68
"it gets overloaded and that's when you start 
creating inflammation additional toxic waste  ",182.16,7.6
"a lot of free radical damage and you create more 
insulin resistance which then leads to diabetes  ",189.76,5.76
"so fructose is actually a lot worse than glucose 
and quite a few other sugars have a combination  ",196.4,5.44
"of fructose and glucose like for example agava 
nectar has a much larger percentage of fructose  ",201.84,8.88
"than glucose even though fructose is low in the 
glycemic index it actually is going to create a  ",210.72,6.4
"lot more damage relating to your blood sugars than 
if you were to consume glucose and just as a side  ",217.12,6.48
"note no one consumes straight glucose by itself 
and it's pretty bizarre if you were to get a  ",223.6,5.04
"glucose tolerance test and check your blood sugar 
by going to the doctor they may give you a glucose  ",228.64,7.28
"drink and then check your blood sugars after you 
do that to determine how you react to glucose but  ",235.92,6.16
"in real life you're never consuming straight 
glucose it's always a combination of things  ",242.72,6.24
"and number five the glycemic index ignores the 
glycemic load the glycemic load is a much better  ",248.96,7.12
"measurement because it's looking at 
the glycemic index plus the amount of  ",256.08,4.88
"carbohydrates and so you're going to get a more 
accurate measurement of what's happening inside  ",260.96,5.36
"the last thing i want to mention is this thing 
called the insulin index the insulin index which i  ",267.6,5.84
"wrote about in my book is all the non-carbohydrate 
foods that have effect on insulin this  ",273.44,8.4
"is way better than the glycemic index because it 
looks at fat and it also looks at protein and just  ",282.48,9.36
"as an fyi the less fat that's in a protein the 
higher things are on the insulin index and this  ",291.84,7.2
"is why whey protein which is virtually free of fat 
it's very very concentrated protein is one of the  ",299.04,6.08
"highest things on the glycemic index and so if you 
knew about that you would always consume protein  ",305.12,7.76
"with more fat you don't want to cook a burger for 
example that's lean protein you'd want to have the  ",312.88,5.2
"fattiest meat that you could find if you wanted 
to keep your insulin as low as possible and just  ",318.08,5.12

load i put the video up right here check it out",323.2,10.08
