if you have diabetes your body does not,14.03,6.15
use or store sugar properly this can,17.0,5.64
cause changes in your veins arteries and,20.18,4.59
capillaries that carry blood throughout,22.64,5.549
your body including your eyes these,24.77,6.93
changes can harm your vision there are,28.189,6.091
two types of diabetic retinopathy that,31.7,5.46
can lead to vision loss one type is,34.28,5.1
called non-pro Liberty diabetic,37.16,6.419
retinopathy or NPD are another type is,39.38,5.55
called proliferative diabetic,43.579,5.791
retinopathy or PDR let's take a look at,44.93,14.159
how diabetes affects the eye light rays,49.37,12.029
enter the eye through the cornea pupil,59.089,5.851
and lens these light rays are focused on,61.399,5.701
the retina the light-sensitive tissue,64.94,5.46
lining the back of the eye the retina,67.1,6.12
sends signals through the optic nerve to,70.4,5.31
the brain where these signals become the,73.22,5.73
images we see with non proliferated,75.71,7.32
diabetic retinopathy or NPD are damaged,78.95,6.15
blood vessels in the retina begin to,83.03,4.17
leak fluids including small amounts of,85.1,5.939
blood sometimes deposits of fats may,87.2,6.12
leak inside the retina these deposits,91.039,5.79
are called hard Exodus with macular,93.32,6.21
edema fluid leaking from the retinas,96.829,4.86
blood vessels can cause the macula to,99.53,5.97
swell or thicken because the macula is,101.689,6.661
responsible for our central or pinpoint,105.5,5.88
vision macular edema interferes with,108.35,6.6
clear vision macular ischaemia occurs,111.38,6.419
when small blood vessels close in this,114.95,5.19
case your macula is affected because it,117.799,4.56
no longer receives enough blood to work,120.14,6.39
properly with PDR many blood vessels in,122.359,6.451
the retina close preventing enough blood,126.53,4.89
from getting to the retina the retina,128.81,4.83
responds to this problem by trying to,131.42,5.91
grow new blood vessels however these new,133.64,6.75
abnormal vessels do not provide proper,137.33,6.51
blood flow they can also bleed as well,140.39,6.45
as lead to scar tissue that may cause,143.84,3.78
the retina,146.84,4.619
wrinkled or even detach that leads to,147.62,7.35
vision loss during an eye exam your,151.459,5.971
ophthalmologist will dilate or widen,154.97,4.829
your pupils with eye drops and look,157.43,4.85
inside your eye to examine your retina,159.799,5.371
because certain conditions happen inside,162.28,5.53
the layers of retina tissue you may need,165.17,4.409
to have a test called fluorescein,167.81,5.78
angiography or another known as Oct,169.579,6.3
these tests allow your ophthalmologist,173.59,4.989
to see blood vessels within the retina,175.879,6.991
if you have diabetic retinopathy your,178.579,6.121
ophthalmologist will decide the best,182.87,4.44
treatment option for you depending on,184.7,5.31
your condition he or she may decide to,187.31,4.709
use medication injections in the eye,190.01,5.009
laser surgery other surgery or a,192.019,6.69
combination of options the goal is to,195.019,5.791
preserve the vision you still have and,198.709,4.831
prevent further loss of sight in some,200.81,5.28
cases treatment may even improve your,203.54,5.699
vision if you have diabetes it's,206.09,4.92
important to remember that maintaining,209.239,3.9
strict control of your blood sugar and,211.01,4.89
your overall health lowers your risk of,213.139,6.451
losing vision however even if your blood,215.9,6.33
sugar is controlled diabetic retinopathy,219.59,6.69
can still occur for that reason you,222.23,6.119
should see your ophthalmologist at least,226.28,4.62
once a year or more frequently as,228.349,5.401
recommended by your eye doctor even if,230.9,5.54
you're not having any visual symptoms,233.75,5.549
also if you have any changes in your,236.44,4.24
vision you should call your,239.299,4.47
ophthalmologist right away if you have,240.68,5.01
any questions or concerns about your,243.769,4.47
eyes or vision in general don't hesitate,245.69,5.189
to bring them up your ophthalmologist is,248.239,6.56
committed to protecting your sight,250.879,3.92
