Diabetes is a big problem worldwide.,9.0,2.5
"The International Diabetes Federation estimates
there are around 450 million diabetics around",11.51,5.78
"the world, and even more folks who could become
diabetic.",17.29,2.82
"So scientists have been looking for a quick
and convenient way of measuring blood glucose,",20.11,3.679
"or how much sugar is floating around in your
blood.",23.789,2.461
"We already have reliable tests for finding
that number, but they make the user stab themselves",26.25,4.529
and draw a little blood each time.,30.779,1.8
"So developers are looking at a way of measuring
blood glucose without using blood at all.",32.579,4.311
"We have non-invasive wearable sensors for
everything from your heart rate to how many",36.89,3.829
"steps you take, so -- where’s my bloodless
blood sugar monitor?",40.719,3.73
"Modern blood glucose monitors were developed
in the late 1960s, and they use some pretty",44.449,4.301
ingenious chemistry.,48.75,1.289
"Up until this point, clinicians had used urine
to measure blood sugar.",50.039,3.75
"But that reading wasn’t reliable -- it could
be thrown off by things as simple as how much",53.789,3.68
you’d had to drink lately.,57.469,1.09
So they had to go to the source and use blood.,58.559,2.57
"One of the earliest strategies used a chemical
reaction to identify the presence of glucose.",61.129,3.901
"The more of this reaction they could detect
taking place, the more glucose was present",65.03,4.17
in the sample to start with.,69.2,1.34
"Those early glucose monitors placed a drop
of blood on a thin membrane that held an enzyme",70.54,4.39
"called glucose oxidase, with an electrode
underneath.",74.93,3.079
"That enzyme allowed glucose in the blood to
react with oxygen, producing gluconic acid",78.009,4.041
and hydrogen peroxide.,82.05,1.499
"The electrode measured changes in oxygen and
hydrogen peroxide, which were proportional",83.549,4.151
to the amount of glucose in the sample.,87.7,1.8
"Other strategies might measure something like
electrons produced by the reaction, or a change",89.5,3.79
"in how the test strip reflects light, but
they usually center around glucose oxidase.",93.29,4.37
"There have been plenty of changes over the
years, like shrinking the electrodes to fit",97.66,3.62
on those little paper test strips.,101.28,1.839
"This design only offers a few data points
throughout the day -- as many data points",103.119,4.011
as you take finger sticks.,107.13,1.33
"And, yeah, you have to prick your finger.",108.46,2.0
"Implantable continuous glucose monitors are
out there as an alternative for some people.",110.46,4.659
"But they still have to be validated with finger
sticks, and they have other drawbacks as well.",115.119,4.04
"So for years, scientists have been trying
to find a reliable way to measure blood glucose",119.159,3.89
without any blood at all.,123.049,1.651
And they have a couple of potential leads.,124.7,1.44
One of the most logical would be to test saliva.,126.14,2.42
"It’s very convenient to collect, and it
contains a measurable amount of glucose.",128.56,4.19
"Research published in 2015 compared salivary
glucose samples to blood samples taken from",132.75,4.39
a traditional finger prick monitor.,137.14,1.78
"The scientists found that glucose concentrations
in saliva corresponded with those in blood,",138.92,4.69
both before and after eating.,143.61,1.67
"You might think that you would find sugar
in spit simply because people have just eaten",145.28,3.08
food that happens to have sugar in it.,148.36,1.69
"But multiple studies have shown that the concentration
of glucose in saliva reflects its concentration",150.05,4.7
"in blood, not just whether you’ve had a
snack lately.",154.75,2.72
"Other researchers have set out to take advantage
of this relationship by designing a sensor",157.47,3.83
"that could be worn as a mouth guard, and send
a wireless signal of the wearer’s glucose levels.",161.3,4.12
"But not every design we’ve come up with
has the same glucose-rich source to pull from.",165.42,4.66
"Scientists are working on a glucose sensing
contact lens that samples sugar from your",170.09,4.38
"tears, which actually have some glucose in
them -- though slightly less than spit.",174.47,3.9
"In preliminary trials done on rabbits, this
style of monitor was shown to pick up on changes",178.37,4.53
in glucose after the subject ate some sugar.,182.9,2.33
"Blood sugar goes up after eating a meal, and
any glucose monitor needs to be sensitive",185.23,4.14
to those kinds of changes.,189.37,1.41
"This is an active area of research, with several
contact lenses in development.",190.78,3.94
"Some use glucose oxidase, while some use other
sensing methods",194.72,3.01
"So you might want to keep your eye out for
those!",197.73,2.25
"Now, sweat is another good candidate, and
quite a few sweat-based monitors have been",199.98,3.88
"attempted, including a pair of eyeglasses.",203.86,1.99
"Like tears and spit, sweat has less glucose
in it than blood.",205.85,3.83
"Plus it’s easily contaminated by all the
gunk and grime that touches your skin all day.",209.68,3.82
"But so far when tested under ideal conditions,
the concentration of glucose in sweat correlates",213.56,4.74
reliably with that of blood.,218.31,1.6
"So these devices could eventually see more
widespread use as well.",219.91,3.26
"The final lead is a patch that measures glucose
in the fluid between your skin cells, or interstitial fluid.",223.17,5.99
"Your skin cells need nutrients, including
glucose, which diffuses from blood into interstitial fluid.",229.16,5.88
"And researchers can use electricity to help
draw out those sugar molecules and measure them.",235.08,4.08
"Skin has a slight negative charge, which the
device can use to pull positively charged",239.16,4.44
sodium ions towards the skin’s surface.,243.61,2.84
"Some of the larger glucose molecules them
get carried along for the ride to where a",246.45,3.721
glucose oxidase sensor is waiting.,250.171,1.459
"It’s similar to those traditional enzyme
reaction strips, it just takes a little more",251.63,3.69
effort to grab some glucose to sample.,255.32,1.99
"Every device researchers have come up has
its share of drawbacks.",257.31,3.38
"But this is still a young field, and they
are making progress, so noninvasive blood",260.69,4.28
"sugar monitors might be here sooner than you
think.",264.97,2.56
"And while you’re waiting for them to arrive,
maybe you’d like to learn more about how",267.53,3.26
people design and program these kinds of gizmos.,270.79,3.3
"Brilliant offers interactive courses in science,
math, engineering, and computer science.",274.09,3.97
"These courses can help you refine your math
and science skills while learning something new.",278.06,3.88
"The computer science courses cover everything

a programming language used by everyone from",285.78,3.96
scientists and engineers to video game developers.,289.74,2.83

internet connection, you’ll be able to keep learning.",298.1,3.46
