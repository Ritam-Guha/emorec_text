as you can without stopping.",177.478,4.167

the end of your first circuit.",185.014,4.714

grab a quick bit of water,",189.728,2.157
"and go through the circuit two more times,",191.885,2.531
but you gotta do it all without stopping.,194.416,1.984
"If any of these exercises are too easy,",196.4,1.649
"you could up the number of repetitions,",198.049,2.417
"or you could add weight to
make it even more difficult.",200.466,3.985
"If this is too easy
for ya, keep an eye out",204.451,1.901
