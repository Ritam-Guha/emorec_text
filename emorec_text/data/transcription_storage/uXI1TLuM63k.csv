among the medical community and the lake,18.84,4.8
community that peripheral neuropathy is,20.88,5.79
permanent and so people are very upset,23.64,5.129
when they hear that peripheral,26.67,3.96

neuropathy usually the diagnosis is made,73.71,7.019
and the confirmation that the patient is,77.009,6.451
a candidate for procedure is made with a,80.729,5.041
physical exam we can also confirm that,83.46,4.14
further sometimes with nerve conduction,85.77,4.86
studies but most of it we can tell on,87.6,5.19
initial evaluation with physical exam,90.63,4.23
and then assuming the patient is healthy,92.79,4.71
and able to undergo the procedure it's,94.86,4.71
an outpatient procedure that's done in a,97.5,4.799
surgery center takes about 45 minutes,99.57,6.079
there are three or four incisions and,102.299,6.481
the patient has stitches in place for,105.649,6.131
two weeks postoperatively and usually,108.78,5.549
the pain from the neuropathy is gone,111.78,4.89
when they wake up and if they've had,114.329,4.64
numbness associated with the neuropathy,116.67,4.65
