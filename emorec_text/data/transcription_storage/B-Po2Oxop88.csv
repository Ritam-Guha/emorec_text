the human brain is very complex but when,2.01,5.58
we look at the brains of simpler animals,5.399,5.041
we see that the human brain has evolved,7.59,5.34
from them gradually by changing the size,10.44,4.35
and the placement of common brain,12.93,4.47
regions and that diverse animals share,14.79,5.1
common brain regions again suggesting,17.4,4.26
that we can study them in simpler,19.89,6.149
animals not just in humans in fact we,21.66,6.27
can see when we compare the human in the,26.039,4.171
monkey how similar they are we can see,27.93,3.87
in the rat and the mouse that some of,30.21,3.48
the same regions are sort of changed in,31.8,4.559
location and changed in size if we go,33.69,4.98
all the way down to the shark brain we,36.359,3.72
see something that looks on the outside,38.67,3.479
very different instruction from the,40.079,4.32
human brain below but by understanding,42.149,4.62
what the different brain regions are we,44.399,4.59
can see that in fact the parts of the,46.769,3.84
shark brain and the parts of the human,48.989,4.861
brain are rather similar that even the,50.609,5.43
higher processing centers are present in,53.85,4.139
the shark along with regions that,56.039,3.93
control things like movement and,57.989,5.13
learning so we believe that we can study,59.969,5.34
brain regions across different species,63.119,4.711
and understand fundamental principles,65.309,5.901
about how brains work,67.83,3.38
