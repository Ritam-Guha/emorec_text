hey everyone it's sarah so in this,0.0,4.319
pregnancy vlog i'm gonna talk about how,2.31,4.83
i filled my 1-hour oral,4.319,5.521
glucose-tolerance test so does that mean,7.14,4.95
I have gestational diabetes well let's,9.84,4.65
find out so when you're pregnant your OB,12.09,4.74
provider will recommend that you take a,14.49,5.52
glucose test and normally women will,16.83,6.779
take this about 24 to 28 weeks depending,20.01,5.029
on whatever your provider decides,23.609,3.631
sometimes women take it earlier if,25.039,3.761
they've had a history of it,27.24,4.47
so at 26 weeks I had to take my one-hour,28.8,5.279
glucose tolerance test and last,31.71,3.869
pregnancy because it's my second,34.079,3.211
pregnancy I passed with flying colors,35.579,3.241
and did great and I was like yeah I'll,37.29,3.359
take this test and you know I'm gonna,38.82,4.739
pass well I got the phone call later,40.649,4.89
that day that I felt and I was,43.559,4.611
absolutely shocked that I failed because,45.539,6.061
during this pregnancy I have actually,48.17,5.86
been eating a lot healthier than I did,51.6,6.0
with my first one so they called and my,54.03,7.74
result was 146 the cutoff at that OB,57.6,6.66
office is 130 it really varies depending,61.77,5.52
on your OB office but I was 146 so I,64.26,5.52
failed so if you've never taken the,67.29,5.07
one-hour glucose test what it tells is,69.78,4.65
that you have to be fasting mean you,72.36,4.11
can't eat for about two hours before the,74.43,4.829
test and you go there and you drink like,76.47,5.039
this sugary concoction and there's,79.259,4.411
various flavors I always get the fruit,81.509,4.47
punch a lot of people don't like the,83.67,5.19
drinks and they hate drinking it but to,85.979,5.43
me it just tastes like a flat soda but,88.86,4.14
anyways from the time you open up the,91.409,3.991
bottle you only have five minutes to,93.0,4.2
drink it and I normally drink it pretty,95.4,3.719
fast so like less than one minute and,97.2,4.2
then you have to wait an hour and then,99.119,3.871
they draw your blood and they see how,101.4,3.719
much glucose is in your blood now since,102.99,5.01
I fell that one hour glucose test I had,105.119,6.271
to take the three-hour glucose test and,108.0,6.57
that's not exciting to do because it's,111.39,6.479
long test so fortunately I was able to,114.57,5.31
make that appointment with my regular,117.869,4.29
other visit which was just in two weeks,119.88,4.589
so I had to visit everything together,122.159,3.871
and I really recommend if you have to do,124.469,4.41
this that you do that so for this test,126.03,4.53
the prep was a little bit different I,128.879,4.131
had to be fasting so no food,130.56,4.759
at least ten hours and my appointment,133.01,5.55
was at 8:15 so if you have to do this do,135.319,4.98
it in the morning time gets a little bit,138.56,3.539
better so I quit eating at 8 o'clock,140.299,6.27
that night got up went to the office I,142.099,6.181
could only have water so I was drinking,146.569,3.42
lots of water just to keep hydrated and,148.28,3.569
the very first thing you have to do this,149.989,3.661
time is that you have to get a blood,151.849,4.321
draw there's a total of four blood draws,153.65,5.25
for this test so you get a blood draw,156.17,4.44
that's called the fasting one you don't,158.9,3.149
have anything on your stomach so they're,160.61,4.019
gonna see what your blood sugar was then,162.049,6.3
you drink that liquid sugary concoction,164.629,6.33
again and I think it has a little bit,168.349,3.991
more sugar in it compared to the first,170.959,3.601
one and you drink that you have to drink,172.34,4.17
it within five minutes and then that's,174.56,4.049
when the clock starts so I drunk that,176.51,3.509
down pretty fast because I wanted to get,178.609,5.46
this test over and so every hour from,180.019,6.601
that time that I drunk that they would,184.069,8.64
draw blood so I drunk it at 8:30 then at,186.62,8.31
9:30 that was my first straw then at,192.709,4.71
10:30 was my second draw and then 11:30,194.93,5.279
was my last straw and then I waited on,197.419,5.72
my results so two days later they,200.209,5.971
emailed me instead of calling which it's,203.139,4.72
usually good I've noticed that if they,206.18,3.209
email you rather than calling because,207.859,3.151
it's usually better news and they,209.389,3.57
emailed me and told me I had passed my,211.01,3.509
test so that meant I did not have,212.959,3.691
gestational diabetes and I was very very,214.519,4.8
happy about that now to be diagnosed,216.65,4.44
with gestational diabetes,219.319,4.081
out of those four results that they're,221.09,4.709
looking at two of them have to be,223.4,6.03
abnormal so that wasn't the case with me,225.799,6.511
and I'm very happy that it wasn't but I,229.43,5.55
know that a lot of women are really,232.31,4.38
freaked out about this test like,234.98,4.649
whenever you fell your one hour like how,236.69,5.37
I did I was shocked I did not think that,239.629,4.23
that was gonna happen because it didn't,242.06,3.569
happen with my first pregnancy and I was,243.859,3.141
really nervous that I was going to get,245.629,3.72
you know told I have gestational,247.0,5.68
diabetes so if you do have that happen,249.349,4.741
like what happened with me you fail your,252.68,2.699
one hour now you have to take a,254.09,4.019
three-hour don't stress because from,255.379,4.681
what I have heard from my OB provider,258.109,4.141
and other women this is very common that,260.06,3.95
a lot of women fail that one hour,262.25,3.5
but then they passed the three hour and,264.01,4.32
I've even heard of women there one hour,265.75,4.8
glucose tolerance test result being like,268.33,4.53
in the 190s but they still pass so if,270.55,4.35
you're in that situation right now just,272.86,4.05
hold out hope that you know it things,274.9,3.87
are gonna be okay but let's say you do,276.91,4.14
get diagnosed with gestational diabetes,278.77,4.95
first of all you need to know like it's,281.05,5.04
not your fault don't blame yourself,283.72,4.32
don't feel like a failure because I was,286.09,3.42
already starting to feel like that,288.04,3.99
whenever I spelled my one hour because,289.51,4.32
really what's going on with this,292.03,5.04
condition is the placenta is really,293.83,6.48
causing you not to be able to use all,297.07,4.95
that sugar so it's really hanging out in,300.31,4.01
your blood and I have a whole video,302.02,5.22
where I talk about gestational diabetes,304.32,4.96
like what's going on on your in your,307.24,4.29
body why you have it signs and symptoms,309.28,4.23
and treatment those lab results and,311.53,3.9
everything like that so if you do get,313.51,3.42
that diagnosis I really recommend that,315.43,2.94
you check that video out because I think,316.93,2.94
it can help you understand what's going,318.37,3.51
on in your body so I just wanted to give,319.87,4.41
you all that update about what's going,321.88,3.93
on and plus a really one to make this,324.28,3.09
video for the women out there who are,325.81,3.42
going to be searching you know I failed,327.37,3.87
my one hour glucose tolerance test do I,329.23,3.63
have diabetes what does this mean what's,331.24,3.51
that three hour glucose test and just,332.86,3.45
try to encourage you and let you know,334.75,4.53
that yeah this happens and if you do get,336.31,4.92
gestational diabetes what you need to do,339.28,3.81
is just research what's going on with,341.23,4.02
you and just be proactive about it and,343.09,4.32
know that it's really not your fault you,345.25,5.04
