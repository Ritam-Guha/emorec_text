"Hey, Dr. Berg here.",1.849,1.0
I'm going to talk about insulin resistance.,2.849,2.041
"I'm going to make it really, really simple,
so just track with me.",4.89,4.09
Here's what happens.,8.98,1.71
"Your pancreas, which is located in the left,
lower quadrant, right by your rib cage, makes",10.69,7.51
"a hormone called insulin and insulin responds
to sugar.",18.2,5.91
"In other words it's triggered by a sugar or
anything that turns into sugar, so anything",24.11,4.63
"sweet and anything, like even refined grains
can trigger insulin, and it kicks in there",28.74,6.15
and it goes into your cells.,34.89,1.65
"Then, what it does is it removes the sugar
from your blood, so that's the purpose is",36.54,5.64
to lower the sugar.,42.18,2.67
"Normally, in our blood, we need about 100
milligrams per deciliter, and basically what",44.85,6.419
"that means is you can just take and focus
on the 100, so when you get your sugar test",51.269,4.38
and your blood should be like a 100.,55.649,1.49
The goal is to make it 100.,57.139,1.711
Anything higher is bad.,58.85,1.86
Anything lower is bad.,60.71,1.0
We need a 100.,61.71,1.079
"When it's at 100, you're at your mental best.",62.789,3.171
"You're feeling the best but when it goes high,
you get what's called diabetes, so diabetes",65.96,4.8
is the high sugar situation.,70.76,2.42
"When the blood sugars go low, that's hypo-sugar
or hypoglycemia, okay.",73.18,5.579
That's kind of a pre-diabetes state.,78.759,3.781
"When I was twelve, I had hypoglycemia.",82.54,3.03
"I remember skipping a meal and feeling really
dizzy and irritable and cranky, playing outside",85.57,6.38
"and I don't know what it was but, of course,
I was living on pure sugar.",91.95,4.11
"I would raid the cupboards and eat pure sugar
all the time.",96.06,4.229
"That's really what causes hypoglycemia because
what happens is you eat all this sugar and",100.289,5.421
"we get this hyper reactive, high insulin state,
which is going to like take a sledge hammer",105.71,6.589
"and push that sugar right down, so we're going
to have low sugar, irritable, cranky, craving,",112.299,6.451
"dizzy, all those things.",118.75,1.469
"Now what happens over a period of time, when
you're hypoglycemic over a period of time,",120.219,5.51
"your body doesn't like that so it's going
to say, ""Stop,"" so it's going to try to protect",125.729,4.421
"itself and it's going to turn off the receptor,
the thing that receives, so it's going to",130.15,6.45
"ignore that insulin response, so it's not
going to receive it anymore.",136.6,4.95
"Someone's talking but no one's listening,
and that's called a down grade or a blocked",141.55,5.06
"receptor, so it doesn't receive as much as
it did before, and that's what insulin resistance",146.61,6.42
"is because it's your body, your cells are
resistant.",153.03,3.72
"It's inhibiting this absorption because it's
saying, ""Dude, why do you keep eating sugar.",156.75,4.31
"Would you please stop?""",161.06,2.32
"What happens when this happens is it forces
insulin to go higher because it's compensating,",163.38,7.21
"it's on a feedback loop here, so insulin resistance
forces your body to make make more insulin",170.59,5.24
"to create the same effect because without
this insulin, this sugar stays high and your",175.83,5.71
"body does not like that, so it has to lower
it somehow, so it's just going to wear the",181.54,6.48
pancreas out.,188.02,2.21
"Diabetes is really a situation where you have
high sugar and it won't come down to 100.",190.23,7.34
We already passed the hypoglycemic thing.,197.57,1.89
"We're, type II diabetes is insulin resistance
and because of the, you've been eating too",199.46,6.42
much sugar.,205.88,1.94
"When this becomes like that, your body protects
you and several things happen as a consequence,",207.82,6.57
in addition to jacking up more insulin.,214.39,2.24
"Number two, you're going to be hungry.",216.63,2.59
Why?,219.22,1.22
Because insulin has a few other purposes.,220.44,4.89
"It not only lowers the sugar in your blood
but it also helps you absorb the nutrition",225.33,6.17
"in your cells, so the nutrients, fatty acids,
proteins, vitamins, so without insulin you",231.5,8.96
"can't get the nutrition in your cells, so
guess what you're going ... You're going to",240.46,3.49
be hungry all the time.,243.95,1.0
You're not going to be satisfied.,244.95,1.86
"You eat but it doesn't really go in, so you
have this fat person that's starving to death.",246.81,6.63
"You can't get healthy like that, and then
you're also going to crave carbs like crazy.",253.44,3.97
"Just so you know, if you're craving carbs
or sweets, it is literally impossible to burn",257.41,6.58
"fat, so every time that you're craving, you're
not burning any fat.",263.99,3.03
Don't worry.,267.02,1.0
I'll show you how to fix that.,268.02,1.22
"We've got cravings, hunger and decreased nutrition,
and that's why, over a period of time, diabetics",269.24,5.39
end up with all sorts of health problems.,274.63,2.16
They go blind.,276.79,1.12
"They get their feet start getting, destructive
nerves, so it's called peripheral neuropathy",277.91,4.61
"and they get tingly in the feet and the hands,
and they just kind of go down hill.",282.52,5.04
"Then also, this condition is going to prevent
the storage of sugar.",287.56,6.17
"It's called glycogen, which basically is a
stored sugar in your liver and your muscles,",293.73,4.03
"so we need that to live off of when we're
sleeping, between meals, and so if we can't",297.76,7.47
"store the sugar as much anymore, what happens
is we end up having all sorts of problems",305.23,7.62
"with storing more fat, if we're not storing
sugar we have to store more fat so you're",312.85,4.95
"going to keep getting fatter and fatter and
fatter.",317.8,3.01
"Also, in between the meals, because you can't
have a storage of sugar, you're going to have",320.81,5.35
"too many highs and too many lows, so it's
going to come up and down too much.",326.16,5.82
"It's the storage of that sugar that maintains
a nice level sugar, and especially noted with",331.98,6.81
"you get up in the morning, after not eating
for eight hours.",338.79,2.92
There's a couple things I want to cover.,341.71,4.61
Let's go back to this sugar.,346.32,2.05
We need 100 milligrams per deciliter.,348.37,4.31
That would equal about five grams of sugar.,352.68,1.66
"That's like a heaping teaspoon of sugar in
your entire body, on an average person, they",354.34,5.341
"only need a teaspoon of sugar but not consuming
sugar, but from the food that converts to",359.681,5.439
"the sugar, even protein and fat can convert
to sugar, so we need about one teaspoon of",365.12,6.32
sugar.,371.44,1.0
We don't need more than that.,372.44,1.0
Check this out.,373.44,1.47
"An eight ounce, typical can of soda, an eight
ounce typical glass of orange juice, is about",374.91,9.06
thirty-nine teaspoons of sugar.,383.97,3.31
"Okay, so now we went from five to thirty-nine.",387.28,5.66
That's a tremendous stress on the pancreas.,392.94,3.02
Oh my gosh.,395.96,1.38
"What you're doing is you're just wearing the
thing out.",397.34,1.88
"It's creating whiplash of your pancreas, and
because the pancreas has two parts, one is",399.22,5.25
"a hormone part and the other is an enzyme
part, called the exocrine gland, you're going",404.47,5.32
"to start having all sorts of digestive problems,
including possible pancreatitis, inflammation",409.79,6.63
of the pancreas.,416.42,2.49
"Tension in your upper digestive system, bloating
for sure, maybe even pain that goes around",418.91,5.92
"in your back, undigested proteins.",424.83,3.38
You can't digest protein anymore.,428.21,3.76
"All sorts of bowel problems, I mean you name
it.",431.97,3.38
It creates a lot of problems.,435.35,2.08
"Now, the body is trying to protect itself
from too much insulin so it's going to block",437.43,5.25
"the resistance, the receptor, create more
resistance in there, and then the sugar's",442.68,4.403
"going to go high, so apparently the body is
going to protect the cell and not necessarily",447.083,6.797
the blood.,453.88,1.0
"That's why the blood starts filling up with
sugar and that's where you get all this extra",454.88,5.41
fat and triglycerides and cholesterol.,460.29,2.26
"In other words, triglycerides are blood fats,
and because the cell can't absorb nutrition",462.55,6.899
"anymore or protein or fat, it's going to dump
around the rest of the body as, in the blood",469.449,7.261
"as blood fats, out of post tissue and cholesterol.",476.71,4.98
Those are the effects of this situation.,481.69,2.99
"We've got this hypoglycemia thing, which is
high sugar, and then the receptor becomes",484.68,5.97
resistant so it doesn't absorb it anymore.,490.65,2.59
"That's type II diabetes, that creates all
sorts of problems, and then down the road",493.24,5.47
"you end up with diabetes type I and in type
I the pancreas is already asleep.",498.71,6.49
"It can't produce this anymore, so now you
have to be injected because the sugars are",505.2,5.87
"going higher and higher and higher and your
insulin can't keep up to lower them.",511.07,4.569
"Yes, there are other causes of diabetes type
I, auto-immune, but the question is what causes",515.639,5.65
"auto-immune, that's another video.",521.289,2.92
"The point is that type I diabetes is the worst
situation because now you completely ran out",524.209,5.82
"of this whole situation and now you have to
be injected or take insulin.",530.029,5.151
What do we do about this?,535.18,2.829
What can be done?,538.009,1.3
"Well, there's a couple things you can do.",539.309,3.47
"Number one, we need to lower insulin.",542.779,5.04
We need to lower insulin.,547.819,1.441
That has to be a primary goal.,549.26,2.29
Doctors do not emphasize this enough.,551.55,3.819
What they do is they give you insulin.,555.369,2.291
They don't put enough attention on the diet.,557.66,1.85
"They don't realize that in a diabetic situation,
in a hypoglycemic situation, if the person's",559.51,5.439
"craving, they should not be consuming any
sugars, zero.",564.949,5.44
"Don't give the person recommendations like
everything in moderation.",570.389,2.111
"That would be very bad, zero sugars.",572.5,2.63
"They can do substitute sugars like Zilotol,
Stevia but they can't afford to continue to",575.13,5.8
"eat more sugar or juice, so number one we
avoid things that trigger insulin, and then",580.93,5.829
"we also can increase other things too, primarily
potassium.",586.759,5.781
Why?,592.54,1.799
"Because potassium will help lower insulin,
help you store sugar and you want to get it",594.339,7.521
"from the food, so you would need to consume
at least seven to ten cups of vegetable or",601.86,5.969
"the Cal Shake I recommend because it has all
the potassium in it, you can make it.",607.829,3.63
"I show you how to, on my website, how to make
that.",611.459,3.24
"Seven to ten cup of vegetable to get your
potassium that will also really help cravings",614.699,5.021
because it's going to lower insulin.,619.72,1.429
"Number two, you want to increase vitamin B1
but really, the other B complex is vitamins",621.149,6.47
"too but I recommend getting this, not from
a pill, but from nutritional yeast.",627.619,6.421
Why?,634.04,1.31
"Because nutritional yeast is a great form
of natural B vitamins that will greatly assist",635.35,6.859
in lowering insulin.,642.209,1.471
Why?,643.68,1.0
"Because when you consume all this sugar, you're
actually dumping all your B vitamins and your",644.68,4.861
"potassium out through the urine, up to fifteen
times more than if you didn't have this problem,",649.541,4.999
so you're losing all this.,654.54,1.649
Don't worry.,656.189,1.421
"Consuming nutritional yeast won't give you
a yeast infection.",657.61,3.27
All right.,660.88,1.0
"The last thing I want to recommend would be
protein.",661.88,3.829
"Because protein is a nutrient and it's blocked
from the cell, you're probably going to be",665.709,3.441
"deficient in protein so you need to have protein
especially for breakfast, okay.",669.15,6.02
"That's very important because if you don't,
then at the end of the day your blood sugars",675.17,4.899
"are going to be so far off that you're going
to need, the need for insulin and medication",680.069,5.941
"is going to be much, much greater.",686.01,2.119
"I hope I helped you understand this and one
last point.",688.129,5.241
"Insulin stops fat burning, in the presence
of insulin you will not burn fat, so the goal",693.37,5.37
is to lower insulin and to a normal level.,698.74,2.829
I hope this helped.,701.569,1.0
