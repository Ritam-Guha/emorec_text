hi guys in this video I want to talk,0.0,3.419
about the relationship between low blood,1.439,3.511
sugars and your brain it's very,3.419,4.201
interesting that normally your brain,4.95,6.979
will run on either glucose or sugar or,7.62,7.649
ketones which are the byproduct of fat,11.929,5.141
burning but not amino acids or fatty,15.269,5.701
acids okay now when you induce low blood,17.07,6.57
sugar healthily naturally using,20.97,5.04
ketogenic diet or in a minute fasting,23.64,4.32
you're not going to have the problems,26.01,3.599
I'm going to talk about okay you're not,27.96,3.18
gonna have these symptoms it's actually,29.609,3.331
that's a you want your blood Sugar's a,31.14,3.57
little on the low side but to do it,32.94,3.6
naturally and gradually over a period of,34.71,4.38
time okay what I'm going to be talking,36.54,5.1
about in this little section is actual,39.09,4.71
hypoglycemia low blood sugar while,41.64,4.02
you're still eating carbs and you're not,43.8,5.579
fully adapted to the ketones okay so,45.66,5.64
you're still running on sugar but you,49.379,4.471
have low blood sugars so so here's what,51.3,4.89
happens well there's a couple things you,53.85,4.439
need to know the brain does not store,56.19,4.95
sugar as glycogen that means it doesn't,58.289,4.801
have a storage like the muscle or the,61.14,5.79
liver so it's dependent on the sugar in,63.09,6.66
your blood so if there's low blood sugar,66.93,7.83
this thing starves okay now when you,69.75,8.79
starve the brain of glucose you shut,74.76,6.66
down the oxygen to the brain so you,78.54,5.579
starve it a fuel and oxygen well guess,81.42,3.75
what's gonna happen you're going to get,84.119,2.79
a condition called anoxic irritability,85.17,4.68
which is basically starving the neurons,86.909,4.92
with oxygen which is very toxic and,89.85,4.08
irritating to the nerves so you actually,91.829,5.18
can kill the nerves you kill the brain,93.93,6.21
now if you have a chronic hypoglycemic,97.009,4.991
situation low blood sugars over a long,100.14,3.06
period of time you actually create,102.0,4.079
degeneration in the brain and all sorts,103.2,5.79
of neurological issues tremors and a,106.079,5.881
whole bunch of other issues okay so,108.99,4.65
again that's if you're doing it,111.96,4.259
unhealthily you do it naturally you're,113.64,5.45
not going to have those effects now,116.219,5.281
there is a protective mechanism that,119.09,4.26
happens when your blood sugars go low,121.5,6.24
and that's by the adrenal gland and some,123.35,7.24
other organs as well so you get this,127.74,5.7
kick in of the spike of adrenaline,130.59,4.61
when the blood Sugar's go to a low and,133.44,3.78
there's a whole bunch of symptoms that,135.2,3.55
can occur if that happens too quickly,137.22,4.08
but your adrenaline and cortisol are,138.75,5.25
trying to raise the sugar up there's,141.3,4.02
other hormones too but I'm not going to,144.0,3.93
get into it at this point so here if,145.32,4.98
your adrenals are stressed and you have,147.93,6.24
hypoglycemia and you're not changing,150.3,7.05
your diet you're gonna have all sorts of,154.17,5.52
issues because the adrenals will not be,157.35,5.88
able to counter this efficiently so you,159.69,5.31
end up have with low blood sugars that,163.23,3.78
don't seem to rebound at a nice,165.0,4.26
comfortable healthy level so it creates,167.01,4.53
a lot of strain on the nervous system,169.26,4.53
okay so the whole goal with this is to,171.54,4.86
correct the low blood sugar not by,173.79,4.35
adding more sugar into the diet that's,176.4,3.18
never going to work it's gonna always,178.14,3.15
make things worse and there's so many,179.58,3.18
people that are recommending this six,181.29,3.57
meals a day and eat candy and it's,182.76,3.96
that's the worst advice what you need to,184.86,4.26
do is what's behind the low blood sugar,186.72,3.33
or something called insulin resistance,189.12,3.12
there's a whole bunch of things you can,190.05,5.76
do to correct that so it doesn't become,192.24,5.76
a problem so eventually you can,195.81,5.19
normalize the resistance normalize the,198.0,4.83
blood sugar because insulin is now,201.0,4.02
healed and then the brain will do a lot,202.83,4.909
better cognitive functions mood issues,205.02,5.34
won't clear up so I'm gonna put a link,207.739,5.231
down below exactly how to do that it's,210.36,3.81
called the keto and intermittent fasting,212.97,4.519
eating plan alright thanks for watching,214.17,6.3
hey before you go definitely sign up for,217.489,4.901
my free keto course I put a link down,220.47,4.41
below it's on messenger in Facebook but,222.39,4.349
it will give you all the basics it's,224.88,3.66
