podiatrists and today we're here to,5.629,4.211
discuss the do's and don'ts of diabetic,7.649,4.2
foot care we're gonna focus on three,9.84,4.29
major areas which is diabetics and their,11.849,5.01
skin diabetics and their feeling and,14.13,4.8
diabetics following injuries and how,16.859,3.42
they should follow up with that,18.93,4.95
so overall diabetics often have problems,20.279,5.371
with nail discoloration or nail,23.88,4.26
loosening or thickening as well as,25.65,4.889
severely dry skin so I often tell,28.14,3.869
patients when they see any of those,30.539,2.761
problems they should come in see a,32.009,2.851
podiatrist sooner than later so you can,33.3,3.63
diagnose what's going on I always,34.86,4.109
recommend patients to lotion their feet,36.93,4.68
often make sure it really dries in and,38.969,4.441
make sure the dilution is not in between,41.61,3.269
their toes because that can cause,43.41,4.35
maceration the second thing that happens,44.879,4.921
is diabetics sometimes to get what is,47.76,3.959
called diabetic neuropathy where they,49.8,4.11
experience numbness and tingling in,51.719,4.5
their toes that may go up their foot and,53.91,5.309
ankle or they may have a general pain or,56.219,6.0
burning in their foot and ankle so I,59.219,4.561
think all patients when they have those,62.219,3.001
symptoms that should come in see a,63.78,3.54
podiatrist once more so we can actually,65.22,4.56
diagnose what's going on and medications,67.32,5.1
that we can prescribe to them because of,69.78,4.68
that patients are often told not to go,72.42,5.07
barefoot that's the first do do not go,74.46,5.46
barefoot barefoot includes soft soled,77.49,5.129
shoes socks as well as actually being,79.92,5.1
barefoot and the reason is that patients,82.619,4.201
do have diabetic neuropathy may lose,85.02,3.87
their protective sensations and they may,86.82,6.63
get a cut or scratch or a nail inside,88.89,6.33
their shoe that they don't know even a,93.45,3.39
bottle cap I've had patients has come in,95.22,3.3
with a bottle cap and their foot and,96.84,4.139
they didn't know was there so it's a,98.52,3.75
first line of protection for those,100.979,3.21
patients don't go barefoot swear,102.27,2.94
supportive shoes,104.189,5.011
the second thing goes into patients not,105.21,6.089
soaking their feet that's often a common,109.2,2.44
myth,111.299,2.291
section where patients at the end of the,111.64,3.87
day they want to soak their feet for a,113.59,4.08
long period of time and the reason being,115.51,3.99
is that you can soak it too long and,117.67,4.17
actually cause a softening of your skin,119.5,4.38
or you may not be able to gauge the,121.84,4.68
temperature then actually this so what I,123.88,4.08
tell patients is that when they're,126.52,3.39
taking a shower they should stop up the,127.96,4.32
water and just stand in the water for,129.91,3.84
some time while they're bathing and,132.28,3.81
prior to that this uses their hand or,133.75,4.41
their elbow to gauge the temperature of,136.09,4.32
the water so that they're not at risk of,138.16,4.68
developing a burn to their feet or even,140.41,4.53
a cold injury because that often happens,142.84,4.26
as well the other thing they would like,144.94,3.93
to go over is diabetics and injuries,147.1,3.33
diabetics are just like us they're,148.87,3.39
active patients and sometimes against,150.43,4.02
sprains or they twist your ankle or they,152.26,4.02
drop something heavy on their foot and,154.45,3.63
they may not know that they actually,156.28,3.929
have a worse injury than what they think,158.08,4.65
it is so I tell my diabetic patients if,160.209,4.231
something like that ever happens call up,162.73,3.45
your podiatrist let them know it happens,164.44,4.019
and they should see within 24 to 48,166.18,4.95
hours and if it's a major injury like a,168.459,5.761
laceration or a real fracture of course,171.13,5.1
go and see your emergency department so,174.22,4.62
that they can take care of that diabetic,176.23,4.229
patient should also look at their feet,178.84,4.5
on a regular basis so the best time to,180.459,4.141
do that is after you get out of the,183.34,3.69
shower here we have a magnifying glass,184.6,5.07
which extends like this you can purchase,187.03,5.16
this from any drugstore and she can,189.67,4.289
demonstrate how easy it is to look at,192.19,3.78
the bottom of your feet this should be,193.959,3.901
part of your daily routine just like,195.97,3.75
brushing your teeth should keep it in,197.86,3.719
your medicine cabinets after you have,199.72,4.38
the shower dry your feet thoroughly dry,201.579,4.41
it in between your toes and look at your,204.1,4.35
feets really well and the importance of,205.989,4.47
that is that if you do have a cut or a,208.45,4.5
scrape or blister or anything that looks,210.459,5.641
abnormal you can see it first and call,212.95,4.68
your local podiatrist to come and get it,216.1,3.66
checked out so two take-home message,217.63,3.99
that anything that looks suspicious,219.76,3.15
in terms of the health of your feet,221.62,4.17
should be evaluated by a podiatrist as,222.91,4.02
soon as possible,225.79,3.69
don't treat any pain yourself it's,226.93,4.32
always best to have a doctor that treats,229.48,4.14
it so those are my tips and pearls for,231.25,2.99
