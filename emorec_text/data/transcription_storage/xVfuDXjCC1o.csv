sorry and calm and in this video i'm,1.92,3.6
going to demonstrate how to check the,3.84,3.959
urine for glucose and protein which is,5.52,5.55
done during prenatal visits so why don't,7.799,5.371
we check the urine of a pregnant woman,11.07,3.54
for glucose and proteins,13.17,3.18
well pregnant women are at risk for,14.61,3.96
gestational diabetes and preeclampsia,16.35,5.31
and I have some videos over those topics,18.57,5.1
if you would like to review those but,21.66,3.359
we're looking for glucose in the urine,23.67,3.449
because this could indicate gestational,25.019,4.26
diabetes and we're looking for protein,27.119,4.89
which could indicate that the woman may,29.279,5.28
be developing preeclampsia so you'll,32.009,4.431
want to of course perform hand hygiene,34.559,4.471
dawn some gloves you'll need the,36.44,4.9
specimen provided from the pregnant,39.03,5.189
woman you'll also need a test strip and,41.34,5.699
you'll need the diagram because you'll,44.219,5.311
be referencing this test strip with,47.039,5.011
these colors so I've performed hand,49.53,4.83
hygiene and I'm donned gloves now we're,52.05,5.099
going to take this test strip and we are,54.36,5.629
simply just going to dip it in the urine,57.149,5.64
like this and then we are going to take,59.989,5.441
it and lay it like this and we're gonna,62.789,5.4
wait for one minute and read results so,65.43,4.47
it's been a minute now we're gonna take,68.189,2.79
our test strip and we're going to,69.9,4.17
compare it with the little color key the,70.979,5.761
top one is the glucose and based on our,74.07,6.06
color it is normal for glucose the,76.74,6.03
bottom one is checking for protein and,80.13,5.52
based on its color it is negative for,82.77,5.31
protein after you interpret the results,85.65,4.14
you want to dispose of the urine per,88.08,3.87
your facility's protocol Dolf your,89.79,4.32
gloves and perform hand hygiene okay so,91.95,4.379
