[Music],1.41,5.07
so good morning viewers,7.759,3.521
my name is dr supratik bhattacharya i'm,8.96,3.48
a consultant,11.28,3.76
endocrinologist based at kolkata so,12.44,4.839
another very important topic,15.04,5.159
that we want to talk about today is,17.279,4.241
pre-diabetes,20.199,4.201
the diagnosed cases of diabetes is only,21.52,4.8
the tip of the iceberg,24.4,4.56
so if you see the numbers in hand we,26.32,5.359
have around 77 million people suffering,28.96,4.08
from diabetes,31.679,4.56
but in india itself all across the world,33.04,4.72
the number goes up to,36.239,3.761
around 400 millions and it's going to,37.76,4.4
touch very soon to 600 million by the,40.0,2.96
time we're,42.16,4.0
in 2035 but a much,42.96,5.919
much larger number are having,46.16,3.919
pre-diabetes,48.879,3.921
who had not yet been diagnosed and will,50.079,5.041
be having diabetes very shortly,52.8,5.04
if they do not make major lifestyle,55.12,4.239
changes,57.84,4.239
reduce their weight stop smoking start,59.359,3.441
walking,62.079,3.681
and things like that now pre-diabetes is,62.8,4.24
a stage,65.76,5.679
where the sugar levels are high,67.04,7.439
higher than usual but it has not,71.439,5.68
touched the zone which we can classify,74.479,4.0
as diabetes,77.119,4.961
so conventionally we do a fasting sugar,78.479,5.921
we do a prandtl sugar that is the after,82.08,3.359
meal sugar,84.4,3.28
and we also do an average of the past,85.439,3.601
three months sugar which we,87.68,4.799
call hba1c so what is the diagnostic,89.04,5.52
criteria of pre-diabetes,92.479,4.801
so anyone who has got their fasting,94.56,3.36
level,97.28,3.68
between 100 and 126,97.92,5.68
or the after meal sugar between 140 and,100.96,4.159
200,103.6,5.08
or the average sugar hba1c between,105.119,7.721
5.7 and 6.4 would be considered,108.68,6.2
pre-diabetic the importance of,112.84,3.8
pre-diabetes is that,114.88,5.279
this is that particular place where,116.64,6.64
you can do diet and you can do exercises,120.159,4.32
and have a very,123.28,5.28
strict regime of lifestyle maintenance,124.479,8.001
thus revert diabetes or,128.56,6.24
propensity to develop diabetes in the,132.48,3.52
first place,134.8,4.159
for those kind of individuals we need to,136.0,4.64
have a screening program,138.959,5.36
where we do at least annually one test,140.64,7.36
that is hpa1c or the average blood sugar,144.319,6.081
to detect whether they have already,148.0,3.519
started developing,150.4,4.16
diabetes or predisposed to be having,151.519,3.841
diabetes,154.56,3.84
at a later life and these are the,155.36,3.92
individuals,158.4,3.199
who have a very strong background of,159.28,3.92
diabetes in the family,161.599,4.0
like one of the closest members like the,163.2,3.44
mother of the father,165.599,2.801
brother or sister suffering from,166.64,4.16
diabetes or they're overweight,168.4,5.36
