"hey everyone its Kara from purediabetes.com
bootcampforbetics.org",0.02,6.64
"depending on where you know me from
anyway",6.66,3.21
"I am hiding in my bedroom right now
because I just put my children to bed",9.87,5.79
"and I just got my first Afrezza
that's the INHALABLE INSULIN",15.66,6.859
"prescription and I'm going to try it. Now,
in order to try Afrezza and kind of",22.519,7.651
"figure out how it's supposed to work
with my body I figured the best way to",30.17,5.71
"do this was to purposefully raise my
blood sugar so that it is high so that I",35.88,9.24
"can take Afrezza and see how long it
takes my blood sugar to come back down",45.12,4.349
"now I tried to eliminate any outside
external factors that can affect my",49.469,5.91
"blood sugar. For example I have not had
any carbs for the last two hours, I",55.379,5.82
"haven't had any protein or fat for the
last four hours so I'm not exactly",61.199,5.331
"fasting. I'm postprandial. I didn't take
any insulin for the carbs that I had a",66.53,5.65
"couple hours ago and what that means is
that my blood sugar is high and it's",72.18,5.82
"high on purpose because I want to see
what actually happens when I take this",78.0,4.29
"Afrezza. Now, first of all I want to say
that I got with my prescription 90",82.29,6.77
"little cartridges of Afrezza and each of
those cartridges contains four units of",89.06,7.269
"insulin, or at least the equivalent of
four units of insulin so if Afrezza",96.329,5.761
"works exactly the same or is exactly as
strong for me as Humalog or Novolog, then",102.09,8.13
"four units of Afrezza should lower
my blood sugar by about the same amount",110.22,5.34
"as four units of Humalog or Novolog. Now,
I've heard that that's not really true",115.56,4.86
"I've heard that Afrezza works a little
bit differently so maybe four units of",120.42,5.339
"Afrezza doesn't exactly equal out to
four units of Humalog or Novolog",125.759,4.321
"and that's why we're going to do some
math and some experimentation",130.08,3.9
"and some waiting - to see how well it
actually works so the first thing I'm",133.98,5.64
"gonna do is note the time it's 737 p.m.
right now and I'm just gonna",139.62,7.979
"check my blood sugar. Hey, you know what
just fell out? A bunch of used test",147.599,4.801
"strips. I bet you've done that before -
oh crap - I'm out of strips it's a good thing I",152.4,5.369
"brought some more strips okay so I'm
gonna check my blood here",157.769,5.871
you can't really see what I'm doing... okay,163.64,5.58
"here now you can see what I'm doing
there we go",169.7,3.45
"I poke myself, get a little bit of blood
and we'll see what my blood sugar is...",173.15,12.82
"alright, so I'm up to 277 so that's been
pretty consistent for me actually for",185.97,6.42
"the last couple of hours I've been
between",192.39,2.069
"I would say 275 and 300 so I think my
blood sugar is pretty stable right now",194.459,7.86
"it's stable &  high but it's still
stable and so what I'm gonna do next is",202.319,6.42
"figure out how to use this darn thing
so my Afrezza came in this...",208.739,8.461
"okay so this is the inhaler, so there is
an inhaler piece to the Afrezza",217.2,7.2
"and it looks like there's some
sort of cover on it.",224.4,6.36
"so I'm gonna pop that cover off so it
looks like my mouth is supposed to go on",230.76,6.449
"that. Okay. So I'm gonna
read the instructions. Ok, this is ridiculous.",237.209,12.741
"Who could...who has the patience to read
instructions like this? I'll throw those away...",253.65,11.19
"And take out one of these guys. This is a
package that contains three insulin",264.84,7.26
"cartridges, and each
cartridge is supposed to contain four",272.1,5.76
"units of insulin so let's see what
happens. The pharmacist said there's only one way to load a",277.86,5.1
"cartridge into the inhaler so I guess
that means I'm supposed to open the",282.96,4.739
"inhaler somehow. Oh! Ok! there you go
I opened it so it goes open like this",287.699,11.071
all right so I'm just going to set this down for a second,298.77,9.209
"so I can figure out how to and this
looks like I should just push it out oh",307.979,6.771
"yeah I guess so all right push it out
it's like like a pill pack you shove it",314.75,7.69
"out I guess all right put this in my
trusty box and okay so wait a second I",322.44,7.199
"need to do some math so my blood Sugar is
275 my insulin sensitivity factor with",329.639,7.5
"Humalog and Novolog is 65 so it's sixty
five times four = 260 so if this Afrezza is",337.139,12.631
"actually as potent as Humalog or
Novolog it should lower my blood sugar",349.77,5.399
"by two hundred and sixty points. My blood
sugar is only 275, so that would bring my",355.169,4.801
"blood sugar down to fifteen?  Hmm that
sounds kind of bad but that's okay,",359.97,6.54
"because look, I have my trusty carbs with
me so we'll see what actually happens. I",366.51,5.909
"don't actually expect this to be as
potent as Humalog or Novolog.",372.419,6.06
"So, Can you see that? It's",378.479,8.471
"hard to see that loads in okay then I
guess when I close it some sort of",386.95,8.28
"poking is supposed to happen and I don't
think I'm supposed to shake it up or",395.23,4.89
"anything... You know I'm going to pause
this video real quick and see if I can",400.12,5.43
"find some instructions online.... Alright I
can totally do this. What was I",405.55,8.58
"supposed to do again? Okay
so I am supposed to close this by",414.13,4.67
"snapping it down. I heard a snap.
Okay, so I'm supposed to hold this flat",418.8,7.44
"I'm just gonna look at the picture real
quick... Yeah this looks pretty good! Okay,",426.24,6.31
"so now I remove the mouthpiece, and I'll face this
way",432.55,7.25
"it didn't really feel like anything so,
All right. Set a timer for five minutes",478.81,11.3
"I think I'm supposed to
remove this old cartridge and throw it",491.31,7.42
"away and I'll see you in five minutes
because that's when I'm going to check",498.73,4.62
my blood sugar next,503.35,2.99
"It hasn't been five minutes yet but I
wanted to mention that only two inhalers",507.63,5.69
"came with my set of 90 of Afrezza
cartridges so I guess I'm supposed to",513.32,7.029
"use this thing like maybe 45 times and
then use the other inhaler 45 times or",520.349,5.761
"maybe I'm just supposed to start
hoarding them because I'll probably",526.11,4.65
"lose them or something.  Anyway I also
wanted to mention that I feel kind of",530.76,5.16
"weird and it might be because I held my
breath for so long but it hasn't been",535.92,8.34
"five minutes yet and I can't imagine the
Afrezza would have worked this quickly",544.26,5.43
"so I think I'm chalking up the weird
feeling to just holding my darn breath",549.69,5.16
"for so long. So, see in a minute",554.85,4.13
"Okay,
it has been five minutes",560.35,7.51
"I was 275 when I first took the Afrezza
and so I'm gonna check my blood sugar",567.86,7.95
again & see what happened,575.81,9.92
"I just wipe my hand on my pants to clean
it off this is how we make do when we're",586.24,8.56
"diabetic. Let's see what my blood sugar says this
time. 268. Well that doesn't really mean",594.8,12.839
"much so I'm gonna wait another five
minutes and see what happens! Set a timer",607.639,9.18
for five minutes. See you in five!,616.819,5.241
"Okay, so I'm 10 minutes post Afrezza
inhale. I'm just gonna clean",623.32,6.15
"my finger on my shirt
and I'm gonna poke it and I'm... oh whoops",629.47,4.5
"I should probably put a strip in the
meter first - hang on one second - I'll get some blood",633.97,24.169
Can you see the blood? it's really grainy isn't it? Probably from the lighting in my bedroom.,658.139,15.88
"Ten minutes later. 269. Not much of a
difference. I'm still not all that",674.019,6.601
"impressed! Okay, so we're gonna wait five
more minutes and I'm going to test again",680.62,4.889
"and then I'm gonna test in 15
minute increments after that so we'll do",685.509,5.491
"one more five-minute break one more test
then I'll test every 15 minutes after",691.0,6.6
"that so it's been 10 minutes and nothing
interesting has happened so far.",697.6,6.109
"Hey we're back! It's been 15 minutes
total now since I took my first hit of",705.3,6.94
"my Afrezza Inhaler and I'm going to check
my blood sugar...AGAIN.",712.24,7.07
"so nothing much happened at the 5 minute
and at the 10 minute increment so let's",719.31,7.87
"see if anything interesting happened at
the 15 minute increment. Hmm okay so",727.18,16.65
"suddenly this Afrezza has become a little
bit more interesting. I dropped 30 points",743.83,8.58
"in 15 minutes, so I guess for me it took roughly maybe 10",752.41,5.46
"minutes to start working and then after
15 minutes I'm down to 246. Cool! Ha!",757.87,11.73
"So, the rumors are true - it looks like Afrezza does start to work a lot more",769.6,8.13
"quickly than the injectable insulins
which is really nice. So, I could use this",777.73,7.38
"as I'd planned as sort of like a rescue
inhaler for high blood sugars when my",785.11,5.37
"blood sugar is unintentionally high, like if my my pump site falls out or, well,",790.48,6.75
"you guys know - this happens all the
time - your blood sugar goes high",797.23,3.03
"sometimes for no reason! If I get a burst
of glucose from my liver or something",800.26,5.4
"like that....Okay, I'm gonna get a little
less excited. But, what I am gonna do is",805.66,7.67
"test in fifteen minutes so, I'm
at 246 fifteen minutes after my first puff",813.33,8.61
"and so the next time I test it'll be 30
minutes after my first puff, so I will see",821.94,6.43
you guys in 15 more minutes,828.37,3.29
"Hey I'm back - it's been 30 minutes since
my last",833.23,7.86
"Afrezza inhaler puff, so I'm gonna
check my blood sugar again and see what",841.09,7.92
"happened. I'm feeling kind of hungry but
I'm not gonna eat because that'll screw up",849.01,8.43
"my experiment so here I go. I'm going to check my blood sugar, get some blood",857.44,8.33
"okay so we're at
thirty minutes & down to 222 - okay I was",871.26,11.17
"kind of expecting something more
exciting, given what happened last",882.43,5.1
"time but that's actually
still pretty good - roughly fifty",887.53,6.08
"milligrams per deciliter in half an
hour - so I think I am just gonna check",893.61,9.49
"again in another 30 minutes this time. So
we'll test a full hour",903.1,6.33
"after that puff, so I'll see you
in 30 minutes",909.43,6.41
"Hey it's me again, just getting ready to
check my blood sugar. It has been one",916.92,7.11
"hour since I took that puff of four unit
Afrezza cartridge and I'm getting",924.03,9.93
"hungry so I kind of want to eat. Anyhow
let's see what has happened. My blood",933.96,7.14
"sugar started at 275 one hour ago and we
will see what it is now!",941.1,15.26
"196. Okay
so not quite a hundred points... I",956.99,7.63
"guess... yes it's about 80 points in an
hour so it still works a lot faster",964.62,8.88
"than Humalog though I think it is I
think it's less potent - less strong",973.5,10.58
