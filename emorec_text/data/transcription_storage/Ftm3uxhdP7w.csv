hi my name is tessa pierce ward,0.32,5.28
and i'd like to talk to you today about,3.76,4.48
sour mesh protein camera sketches for,5.6,4.88
large scents,8.24,3.92
sour mesh is a command line and python,10.48,4.48
library for skilled men hash analyses,12.16,4.0
minhash methods have been around for a,14.96,2.88
little while and they compress data sets,16.16,4.4
into sketches composed of representative,17.84,6.32
subset of their cameras um,20.56,6.959
and uh we we know that long dna cameras,24.16,4.879
uh camera sketches can be used for,27.519,3.68
distance estimation between samples so,29.039,4.401
we if we have a genome and genome b then,31.199,3.921
the sketch is here,33.44,3.76
we can compute the jaccard index the,35.12,4.0
intersection over the union of those,37.2,4.96
sketches and as was published in in 2015,39.12,5.84
2016 um the jaccard has a relationship,42.16,5.68
to nuclear average nucleotide identity,44.96,5.2
so we can get an estimate there,47.84,4.08
sarah mesh actually uses a minhash,50.16,3.6
variant scaled min hash,51.92,4.0
which enables us to do both containment,53.76,4.08
as well as jakarta index and in,55.92,3.52
particular this enables comparisons,57.84,5.68
between sets of different sizes,59.44,5.759
the majority of minhash methods have,63.52,5.04
focused on dna k-mers um which are most,65.199,5.041
useful for differentiating between,68.56,4.08
closely related sequences if we have a,70.24,6.08
couple uh example 21 mirrors with two uh,72.64,5.2
base pair differences,76.32,3.92
in in many cases they are synonymous,77.84,4.48
substitutions that uh end up as the same,80.24,4.72
amino acid and in this example uh these,82.32,4.4
two protein submers are exactly,84.96,3.44
identical,86.72,3.52
so this is um this is just to illustrate,88.4,3.52
that protein sequences allow matching,90.24,3.519
across anonymous substitution and of,91.92,3.36
course we know this uh we've been using,93.759,3.521
it for you know blast x uh protein blast,95.28,4.159
for quite a long time and actually,97.28,4.08
match screen is the first example of,99.439,4.0
using uh protein k-mers for some,101.36,4.079
identification,103.439,4.081
we've been lately pursuing some other,105.439,4.081
protein applications in particular we're,107.52,4.4
exploring taxonomic classification,109.52,4.0
there's some challenges in this realm uh,111.92,4.239
reference databases are often incomplete,113.52,5.04
uh highly divergent genomes sometimes,116.159,4.96
cannot be classified or incomplete and,118.56,4.4
contaminated genomes can can be,121.119,4.161
misclassified and of course our goal is,122.96,4.88
to enable real-time classification to,125.28,5.199
keep up with the scale of incoming data,127.84,4.399
so we've built a snake make workflow on,130.479,3.681
top of star mesh,132.239,3.761
that allows us to string a few commands,134.16,4.64
together to do this,136.0,4.72
so our first step is to use cymesh,138.8,3.84
gather which is a greedy mintset cub,140.72,5.12
algorithm to find the best genome match,142.64,3.92
so,145.84,2.0
to illustrate what this does we have a,146.56,3.28
novel genome with some strain variation,147.84,3.44
in there,149.84,2.64
we can pick out the best reference,151.28,2.959
genome here in flu,152.48,2.8
and and here i'm just kind of,154.239,3.921
representing these these two jams are uh,155.28,5.28
different genuses but the same species,158.16,3.84
um so they they're a little bit,160.56,2.959
different there,162.0,3.92
so we're able to get 60 match to to the,163.519,3.921
blue genome and we can find an,165.92,3.679
additional maybe 25 match to the other,167.44,3.04
one,169.599,3.601
and of course some is unmatched,170.48,4.64
what we can do then um with the tax,173.2,4.399
genome command is take the uh reference,175.12,4.24
taxonomic lineages assigned to each of,177.599,4.801
those best or matching reference genomes,179.36,5.519
and we can uh transfer them on to the,182.4,4.96
match percentages for our novel genome,184.879,4.561
so in this case we're getting 60 to that,187.36,4.959
species a and 25 to that that other,189.44,4.96
reference genome species b,192.319,3.761
but because these are non-overlapping,194.4,5.36
matched regions or match percentages we,196.08,5.76
can actually sum that to get um the,199.76,4.24
percent match at the lowest uh the least,201.84,4.88
common ancestor for these two so in in,204.0,6.0
this case genus x has an 85 match,206.72,6.0
so what we're using this for then is,210.0,5.68
choosing a a percentage or a threshold,212.72,4.96
for when we consider sufficient query,215.68,4.72
match and we can assign um that,217.68,4.4
classification that we get to to our,220.4,3.759
novel genome,222.08,3.12
okay,224.159,3.841
so how well does this work uh we decided,225.2,7.36
to do first a comparison with um gtd btk,228.0,6.959
uh and we started out with a benchmark,232.56,5.0
set of a thousand human gut uh,234.959,6.881
metagenome genomes uh for magnify and uh,237.56,6.2
and these are all likely to have similar,241.84,5.36
genomes available in reference databases,243.76,4.479
we,247.2,3.52
got exact we found exact lineage matches,248.239,5.441
for about 95 when using the full gcb,250.72,4.239
recent release,253.68,4.079
and the additional around four percent,254.959,4.881
of it actually all matched at the genus,257.759,3.6
level so,259.84,3.6
so this is we think it's pretty doing,261.359,3.441
pretty well even though we're using,263.44,3.039
currently a very naive classification,264.8,3.679
threshold of 10 of the query and we need,266.479,2.801
to,268.479,3.361
look into this a little bit further,269.28,5.199
extending this to um an environmental,271.84,5.52
set of samples we took 885 genomes from,274.479,5.361
uh from the tara oceans from the delmont,277.36,4.96
paper um i think neither of them really,279.84,3.68
classified all of them but they got,282.32,2.56
pretty close,283.52,3.28
and here we had exact matches at about,284.88,3.039
66,286.8,3.119
and some match at a higher lineage rank,287.919,4.0
at 33,289.919,3.84
and if we break those down most of those,291.919,3.361
lineage matches happen at the genus,293.759,2.72
level so we,295.28,3.359
got the exact same genius level,296.479,4.56
uh classification but uh a different,298.639,5.84
species was selected as the as the uh,301.039,5.521
exact classification so we need to look,304.479,4.56
into those differences there uh but it's,306.56,5.12
promising uh because this is a really,309.039,4.88
lightweight whole camera or whole,311.68,4.56
protium camera based classification,313.919,4.081
which means it's likely going to be a,316.24,4.32
little more uh robust to incomplete and,318.0,4.88
contaminated genomes and then of course,320.56,3.76
because it's camera-based it offers near,322.88,3.039
real-time classification and with that,324.32,2.64
i'd like to thank you so much for,325.919,3.041
listening um and please do find us on,326.96,4.88
gitter github uh and and everywhere else,328.96,4.64
