about 50% of diabetics are not presently,4.5,6.539
being screened in a timely fashion so,8.34,7.23
often it goes undiagnosed and this is,11.039,7.08
the big challenge for the healthcare,15.57,4.77
system is to figure out more efficient,18.119,5.431
ways to get patients screened presently,20.34,5.13
they need to make an appointment with an,23.55,4.799
ophthalmologist which tends to be a,25.47,4.799
barrier to care because just another,28.349,4.14
appointment these diabetics have to go,30.269,3.931
to they're already seeing many doctors,32.489,3.241
whether it be for kidney problems or,34.2,3.6
just general care and the last thing,35.73,3.21
they want to do is go see an eye doctor,37.8,3.45
and they're not having any symptoms,38.94,4.23
that's why what's really starting to,41.25,4.86
become a standard treatment is this idea,43.17,4.86
of screening patients in the primary,46.11,4.29
care doctors office or the diet ologist,48.03,4.32
office with cameras and that's really,50.4,5.94
kind of becoming the norm it's a way to,52.35,6.81
screen diabetics one takes a picture of,56.34,4.68
their back of their eye those pictures,59.16,3.27
are typically read by a retina,61.02,3.209
specialist in the future,62.43,4.619
augmented intelligence is going to be,64.229,3.93
reading those as well,67.049,2.671
so we're able to screen a lot more,68.159,3.301
patients in a much more patient friendly,69.72,4.05
manner turna they're not having to show,71.46,3.9
up to another doctor having to pay,73.77,4.02
another copay these things tend to be,75.36,5.76
barriers to care or as screening,77.79,5.76
programs in the primary care doctors,81.12,4.08
offices are becoming more and more,83.55,4.8
commonplace I know in the city I work,85.2,4.62
and it really has become the standard,88.35,3.69
way to screen many diabetics that,89.82,5.07
presently are not being screened with,92.04,4.56
their own general ophthalmologists or,94.89,3.03
optometrists wherever they're high care,96.6,3.84
specialists is so I think in the future,97.92,4.739
because there's such an epidemic there,100.44,3.63
such an increase in the number of,102.659,3.871
diabetics the only way they're all gonna,104.07,3.96
be able to be screened is through these,106.53,4.01
larger screening programs using,108.03,5.339
technology using cameras in primary care,110.54,4.66
doctors offices to screen these patients,113.369,5.371
those that have disease then are sent to,115.2,6.209
the eye care specialist who specializes,118.74,5.07
in managing diabetic eye disease and,121.409,4.021
that way they're taking care of those,123.81,3.87
patients their clinics aren't clogged up,125.43,4.68
by screening patients because they're,127.68,4.169
already being screened so we as the,130.11,3.93
retina surgeons are able to manage the,131.849,4.231
patients that actually have disease so,134.04,3.809
everyone wins in that situation so I,136.08,3.33
think you're gonna see more and more of,137.849,3.451
what's term telemedicine or tell a,139.41,3.99
retinal screening goes by several names,141.3,4.47
and it's really a very cost efficient,143.4,4.35
way to screen patients and to prevent,145.77,3.9
them from having vision loss typically,147.75,4.56
patients as mentioned ideally we want to,149.67,4.11
see them before they have any signs and,152.31,3.929
symptoms but patients if they start,153.78,4.74
developing gradual visual blurring those,156.239,4.411
that have diabetic macular oedema tend,158.52,5.04
to get gradual loss and vision central,160.65,5.699
vision in in one eye or both eyes at a,163.56,5.94
time often pages will present with a,166.349,5.521
sudden onset of floaters which is a very,169.5,4.23
common symptom however in diabetics,171.87,3.39
there's always a concern that those,173.73,3.089
floaters are caused by hemorrhaging or,175.26,3.18
bleeding it in the bet in the back of,176.819,3.301
the eye and the vitreous cavity which,178.44,3.629
can cause these floaters sometimes,180.12,3.36
patients will present with a sudden,182.069,3.841
vision loss due to a large vitreous,183.48,4.32
hemorrhage which can cause dramatic drop,185.91,3.99
in vision in a matter of seconds or,187.8,4.26
minutes where patients say hey I saw a,189.9,4.5
shower of floaters and they increase and,192.06,5.13
suddenly everything was very hazy and it,194.4,5.01
happened maybe I woke up with no vision,197.19,4.08
of my eye or or they were doing,199.41,3.45
something outside and they started,201.27,2.88
noticing a bunch of stuff floating in,202.86,3.09
their vision and it started clouding up,204.15,3.54
and that's a typical vitreous hemorrhage,205.95,3.81
will cause that type of symptoms whereas,207.69,3.84
the diabetic macular edema is a much,209.76,3.809
more gradual loss of vision of central,211.53,5.789
blurring without associated vitreous,213.569,5.67
hemorrhage some studies there's a lot of,217.319,4.831
data out there some people believe that,219.239,4.89
about 10% of diabetics will lose their,222.15,2.369
vision,224.129,2.911
recent studies suggest that that numbers,224.519,5.071
increasing because patients are not,227.04,4.86
getting timely care with the increased,229.59,4.74
number of diabetic patients in the,231.9,5.759
limited healthcare access to health care,234.33,4.76
we're seeing more and more patients,237.659,4.08
treated later in their disease which is,239.09,4.119
tragic because we actually have better,241.739,3.241
treatments today than we've ever had and,243.209,4.981
those that get timely care we can,244.98,6.649
prevent them from losing any vision,248.19,3.439
