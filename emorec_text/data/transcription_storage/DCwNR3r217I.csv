"I always thought that eating 
a lot of sugar cause diabetes.",0.16,3.2
"Um, it's a bit more complicated than that.",4.88,2.24
"Diabetes is really common. 
One in 10 people have it. And  ",12.72,3.92
"tens of thousands of people die from it every 
year. And according to a study done by the CDC,  ",16.64,5.6
"by 2050 one in three Americans could have 
diabetes if things keep going the way they are.  ",22.24,6.56
"If you have diabetes that's not kept in check, 
you have way too much sugar, specifically  ",28.8,4.88
"glucose in your bloodstream. So it would be 
logical if eating a lot of sugar caused it.",33.68,5.52
"To understand how sugar in your blood and sugar 
you eat are related, let's start at the beginning:  ",39.2,5.68
"with how you process sugar. You eat something, say 
an apple, and as you digest it, you're breaking  ",44.88,6.8
"down the larger sugars in that apple like sucrose 
into smaller ones like fructose and glucose,  ",51.68,6.56
"which then get into your blood. As blood glucose 
levels rise. Your pancreas starts producing the  ",58.24,5.6
"hormone, insulin. Insulin, and glucose travel 
through your bloodstream to your cells.",63.84,5.44
"Insulin binds to its specific insulin 
receptor first. And that sends a signal,  ",69.28,5.2
"telling your cells to let glucose in. Your 
cells use that glucose to produce energy,  ",74.48,4.96
"energy that keeps your muscles moving, your 
brain working, and a lot of other important  ",79.44,4.96
"processes that keep you alive. With diabetes, 
this whole process is thrown out of whack.  ",84.4,5.68
"But how it's thrown out of whack 
depends on the type of diabetes.",90.08,4.32
"In type one, your immune system destroys cells 
in your pancreas that produce insulin. With  ",94.4,5.6
"less insulin available to bind to receptors on 
your cells, less glucose gets in and you're left  ",100.0,5.76
"with a bunch of glucose in your blood. Type two 
diabetes is way more common than type one. It's  ",105.76,6.24
"actually around 90% of all diabetes cases. In type 
two, your pancreas is producing insulin, but your  ",112.0,7.52
"cells aren't responding to it. Usually because the 
signal telling your cells to let glucose in just  ",119.52,5.84
"isn't getting through. this is called insulin 
resistance. With insulin resistance, your pancreas  ",125.36,5.92
"has to make more and more insulin to keep up with 
rising blood glucose levels. For a while that  ",131.28,6.16
"might work okay. And the amount of sugar in your 
blood will stay relatively normal, but over time,  ",137.44,5.28
"your pancreas can't keep up. And just like with 
type one, you'll be left with a bunch of glucose  ",142.72,6.16
"in your blood. Gestational diabetes is the type 
of diabetes someone gets when they're pregnant,  ",148.88,5.44
"just like with type two, the pregnant 
person becomes insulin resistant. And I  ",154.32,4.72
"actually didn't know this before doing 
research for this video, but between 30  ",159.04,3.68
"and 50% of people with gestational diabetes go on 
to develop type two within the following decade.",162.72,6.32
"So why is a lot of glucose in your blood a bad 
thing? First, if there's a lot of glucose in  ",169.04,5.2
"your blood, chances are not enough glucose is 
getting into your cells, which is a problem.",174.24,4.56
"Second, having too much sugar in your 
blood can also damage your blood vessels,  ",178.8,4.56
"which means your blood won't circulate as well. 
And that puts you at risk for a heart attack,  ",183.36,4.32
"stroke or kidney damage, as well as nerve and 
vision problems. Your kidneys try to solve that  ",187.68,5.52
"problem by releasing any extra glucose into 
your urine, bringing a bunch of fluids from  ",193.2,5.2
"your tissues with it, which is why most people who 
are starting to realize they might have diabetes  ",198.4,5.36
"report feeling thirsty and also needing to pee all 
the time. As the disease progresses, the symptoms  ",203.76,5.92
"become more serious. People often have trouble 
recovering from infections or healing wounds, and  ",209.68,5.84
"further down the line. There's more of a risk for 
the things I just mentioned, like kidney damage.",215.52,4.8
"Diabetes is a diagnosed based on 
how much glucose is in your blood.  ",220.32,4.4
"So it would seem logical that a diet with tons of 
sugar must cause it, this is a more controversial  ",224.72,6.4
"topic than you might think. There are no 
human studies that prove eating tons of sugar  ",231.12,5.76
"causes type two diabetes, because it would be 
unethical for scientists to give people diabetes.  ",236.88,5.76
"But there are studies showing that having a 
bunch of sugar in your diet can cause insulin  ",243.2,6.64
"resistance, which remember can lead to type two 
diabetes. In one of those studies scientists put  ",249.84,6.24
"volunteers on a diet where for 10 weeks, 25% of 
the calories in their diet came from glucose or  ",256.08,7.04
"fructose sweetened beverages. Interestingly, they 
found that volunteers on the high fructose diet  ",263.12,6.48
"had increased glucose and insulin in their blood 
and they were less sensitive to insulin. They  ",269.6,6.32
"didn't see that for the high glucose diet. 
And it's not clear exactly why there's still  ",275.92,4.8
"a lot of work going on to figure all this out. 
One thing that is very clear is that obesity  ",280.72,5.76
"is the greatest risk factor for developing 
type two diabetes and sugar plays into that.",286.48,5.6
"If you're eating more sugar than your body can 
turn into energy, that sugar will be stored  ",292.08,4.48
"as fat and extra fat, especially fat in your 
abdominal cavity around a bunch of your organs  ",296.56,6.48
"can cause inflammation. Some research has 
shown that inflammation makes our cells  ",303.04,5.12
"resistant to insulin and that resistance 
can actually lead to more inflammation.  ",308.16,5.52
"And that leads to more insulin resistance, which 
as you now know, can lead to higher and higher  ",313.68,5.92
"levels of sugar in your blood. But a lot of 
sugar in a person's diet can still increase  ",319.6,4.96
"insulin resistance. Even if the person doesn't 
gain weight for people with type two diabetes,  ",324.56,5.76
"healthier eating and exercise can sometimes be 
enough to manage it, but more likely a doctor  ",330.32,5.36
"will prescribe different medications to keep blood 
sugar at a reasonable level. There's also so much  ",335.68,6.0
"research that's focused on preventing diabetes and 
its complications and even trying to reverse it.",341.68,8.88
