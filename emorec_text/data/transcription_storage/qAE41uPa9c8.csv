hello my name is Karen Davies and I work,4.94,6.819
for diabetes nurse specialist I also,8.46,5.099
deliver training for the NHS health,11.759,4.201
check program which is a cardiovascular,13.559,5.88
disease prevention service in this short,15.96,5.489
video I'd like to give you some,19.439,5.67
information on the hba1c test and how it,21.449,12.691
can be used in health plans H P stands,25.109,12.36
for hemoglobin hemoglobin is a protein,34.14,7.23
molecule on the red blood cell we know,37.469,6.0
that the lifespan of the red blood cell,41.37,6.66
is approximately 120 days we also know,43.469,7.951
that glucose or sugar attaches itself to,48.03,6.509
the red blood cell so the higher the,51.42,5.909
blood glucose level the more glucose,54.539,4.68
that attaches itself to the red blood,57.329,5.761
cell the hemoglobin alpha 1 C therefore,59.219,6.51
as a test that averages out the blood,63.09,5.459
sugar level over the last two to three,65.729,5.18
months,68.549,2.36
along with the fasting plasma glucose,73.92,6.22
the hba1c can be used as a diagnostic,76.719,8.07
tool of diabetes it's also used to,80.14,7.589
measure ongoing control with somebody,84.789,6.421
who has diabetes one advantage against,87.729,6.0
the fasting plasma glucose is that the,91.21,4.979
person doesn't have to fast to have the,93.729,6.631
test we also know from research trials,96.189,7.47
there is an evidence base in terms of,100.36,6.39
reducing the hba1c and to improve,103.659,11.811
outcome some of you may be used to hba1c,106.75,11.789
being expressed as a percentage result,115.47,8.56
however since 2009 the UK are adopting,118.539,8.94
the IFC SI International Federation of,124.03,6.299
clinical chemistry unit of measurement,127.479,5.601
the millimoles per month,130.329,6.181
[Music],133.08,7.87
the normal hba1c result is a reading,136.51,8.58
below 41 millimoles per month a person,140.95,5.879
would be classed as high risk of,145.09,4.77
diabetes if their result was between 42,146.829,6.83
and 47 millimoles per low,149.86,7.43
this is classed as pre-diabetes or,153.659,8.381
non-diabetic hyperglycemia a current,157.29,8.38
nice guidance so adults with type 1 and,162.04,7.559
type 2 diabetes Advisors that we target,165.67,8.42
a hba1c of 48 millimoles per mole,169.599,7.5
however it's really important to,174.09,5.979
individualize targets for the person in,177.099,5.191
front of you especially if they're at,180.069,4.95
risk of hypoglycemic episodes on low,182.29,7.669
blood sugars and they have no hypo wins,185.019,4.94
[Music],190.18,3.079
the hba1c if it's not in target range,193.26,6.89
might be tested three to six monthly,197.099,5.821
otherwise it might be at six monthly,200.15,5.89
two-year interval,202.92,6.779
[Music],206.04,3.659
there have been two large-scale clinical,209.84,7.02
trials the DCCT and the UKPDS,212.33,7.8
but both have proven that by reducing,216.86,6.93
your hba1c by eleven millimoles per mole,220.13,6.51
you can reduce the risk of micro,223.79,13.14
vascular complications by 25% a person,226.64,13.62
can reduce the hba1c by making positive,236.93,6.36
lifestyle changes these might be,240.26,5.039
maintaining a healthy weight or,243.29,5.97
increasing up physical activity a high,245.299,6.481
body weight or large waist measurement,249.26,4.259
can increase your risk of developing,251.78,6.09
type 2 diabetes to maintain a healthy,253.519,4.981
weight,257.87,4.92
refer to the will guide this encourages,258.5,7.11
you to eat at least 5 portions of fruits,262.79,5.43
and vegetables every day with a higher,265.61,7.35
focus on vegetable increasing fiber and,268.22,7.55
whole grain foods while reducing,272.96,5.85
saturated fats can also help you to,275.77,6.37
maintain a healthy weight current,278.81,6.57
physical activity guidance advises 150,282.14,5.75
minutes of moderate ly intense activity,285.38,5.13
this is when your breathing rate and,287.89,5.98
body temperature increases we are all,290.51,6.11
advised to fit less and to move more,293.87,6.03
"ideally achieving 10,000 steps in a day",296.62,7.299
any patient with results greater than 40,299.9,5.97
to millimoles per mole should be,303.919,4.921
referred on to their GP for further,305.87,8.93
