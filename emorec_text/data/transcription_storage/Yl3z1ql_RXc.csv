"Today I want to answer the #1 most common
question we get asked every day by people",38.41,3.919
"just like you who are looking for straight
answers when it comes to high blood sugar",42.329,4.33
and diabetes:,46.659,2.141
"Can diabetes or high blood glucose levels
be reversed?",48.8,4.529
"Before I get into the specifics of my answer,
I just want to tell you some items you might",53.329,3.641
not be aware of.,56.97,1.69
"Did you know that as the rate of obesity in
our country continues to climb, so does the",58.66,4.38

and Prevention, as many as 1 in 3 U.S. adults",65.62,5.46
"will have diabetes by 2050 if current trends
continue.",71.08,4.52
"And this trend is certainly not isolated to
the U.S. alone...in fact, there are many areas",75.6,4.55
"of the world where the growth rate of diabetes
far exceeds that in the U.S.!",80.15,4.66
"Basically, we are looking at a massive health
endemic that is showing no signs of slowing",84.81,4.97

the differences between early and advanced",119.21,4.76
stages of diabetes.,123.97,2.16
"People with what they call Pre-Diabetes or
Type 2 diabetes have abnormally high levels",126.13,7.15

"This is caused by our body's resistance to
insulin, a hormone meant to control your blood",135.98,4.25

our insulin sensitivity and improve our cellular",141.67,5.24

drugs made with old technology - which raise",147.91,5.99

sugar levels.",153.9,3.28
"Even worse, some of these drugs have proven
to have serious side effects and the long",157.18,4.23

will agree this sounds like a very risky proposition",161.41,4.909
"for anyone concerned with their high blood
sugar levels.",166.319,3.191
"So instead of fixing the cause of the problem,
the bulk of the ""expert"" medical community",169.51,4.87

a crisis they simply can't make a decision,",232.28,5.27
"because of fear, procrastination or denial.",237.55,4.269
"Our second principle is based around a unique,
yet incredibly simple nutrition plan.",241.819,4.75
"A set of sensible eating habits that do not
involve any fad diets of deprivation.",246.569,5.911
"Our third principle is a short duration exercise
program that can be accomplished in as little",252.48,4.759
as 4 minutes a day -- how does that sound?,257.239,3.05

is based on published scientific studies that",260.289,5.321

"You must have a sound nutritional supplement
plan that contains the most effective ingredients",268.77,4.73
