hi I'm Charlotte Lawson a registered and,0.0,4.95
licensed dietitian you might be,2.879,3.841
wondering how to determine the glycemic,4.95,3.63
index of a certain food,6.72,3.959
well first keep in mind that glycemic,8.58,4.17
index is really just a scale rating and,10.679,4.29
how the blood sugar in your and your,12.75,3.96
system is affected by certain foods that,14.969,4.081
we eat now you might have to do a little,16.71,4.1
research because the glycemic index,19.05,4.229
really is a chart and these foods have,20.81,4.959
already been scientifically tested to,23.279,4.861
find that certain number now also keep,25.769,4.621
in mind the glycemic index is really,28.14,4.89
just a guideline the systems not totally,30.39,5.31
proven nor foolproof now if you're,33.03,4.89
looking for a certain calculation you,35.7,4.5
can determine the glycemic load of a,37.92,4.319
certain food you do need to have the,40.2,4.65
glycemic index number and a little bit,42.239,4.111
of information from the Nutrition Facts,44.85,4.83
label this simple calculation is the GI,46.35,6.45
number times the amount of grams of,49.68,5.1
carbohydrate there is per foot in that,52.8,4.98
food divided by 100 and again this is,54.78,5.009
glycemic load not the glycemic index,57.78,4.349
number but this really is kind of giving,59.789,4.26
you a perception on how much that,62.129,4.17
insulin might rise in your system now,64.049,4.831
for an example a banana has a glycemic,66.299,6.32
index of 52 and 20 percent by volume,68.88,6.12
carbohydrates so when plugging into that,72.619,4.721
calculation the glycemic load of a,75.0,5.28
banana is 10 then that's just a little,77.34,4.709
bit of an example again the glycemic,80.28,4.5
load not glycemic index and you will,82.049,3.991
have to look up that chart to find,84.78,4.019
specific foods as glycemic index is not,86.04,4.77
going to be listed on a package on the,88.799,4.14
Nutrition Facts label hopefully that'll,90.81,3.449
point you in the right direction,92.939,5.39
I'm Charlotte and it happy,94.259,4.07
