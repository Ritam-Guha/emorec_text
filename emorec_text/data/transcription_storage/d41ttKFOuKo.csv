hey guys had another question that,0.03,2.73
someone want to know the difference,1.74,3.72
between having numbness in your hands or,2.76,6.21
feet versus tingling or pins and needle,5.46,4.98
type sensation okay what's the,8.97,2.879
difference here's what's probably,10.44,3.869
happening when you have low bottom b1 in,11.849,6.481
the presence of high blood sugar and/or,14.309,7.411
high insulin you're going to destroy the,18.33,5.52
circulation the blood flow to the nerves,21.72,3.87
okay and then that leads to something,23.85,4.08
called peripheral neuropathy it happens,25.59,4.679
in the feet happens in the hands and it,27.93,4.59
starts out as a little tingling then,30.269,5.911
pain it can be burning and then pins and,32.52,5.879
needles and then the last stage is,36.18,4.92
numbness okay as that nerve is dying a,38.399,4.831
simple solution would be to go to the,41.1,4.229
health of store or go online and search,43.23,4.98
out a product called benfotiamine this,45.329,6.271
is a type of B vitamin that is made into,48.21,6.029
a fat soluble form because normally b1,51.6,4.65
is water-soluble but they make it into a,54.239,6.241
fat soluble so it can innervate the fat,56.25,6.21
that surrounds the nerves a lot better,60.48,4.2
it's called the myelin sheath and yes,62.46,4.019
it's synthetic but it doesn't seem to,64.68,4.11
have any side effects but it's a great,66.479,5.191
remedy for neurological damage it's also,68.79,5.67
good for the damage to your retina when,71.67,5.07
you have diabetes or even as a,74.46,4.89
pre-diabetic so this is important this,76.74,5.34
is why I always recommend also taking a,79.35,4.08
nutritional yeast because it has the,82.08,2.76
natural be bad omens in there because,83.43,3.119
this is just one of the beads you want,84.84,4.05
to take all of the B's in a natural form,86.549,6.21
but sometimes you can actually fix it,88.89,5.369
with nutritional yeast but sometimes,92.759,2.97
it's so far advanced you need something,94.259,2.371
a little bit stronger,95.729,3.331
okay so benfotiamine is what you need it,96.63,3.69
could be another condition where the,99.06,2.73
space inside the spinal column is,100.32,3.119
getting smaller and smaller and that's,101.79,3.96
called spinal stenosis okay that's,103.439,5.161
another condition it could be something,105.75,4.979
called thoracic outlet syndrome withers,108.6,4.35
in the neck you have an obstruction,110.729,5.701
whether it's a nerve damage or a spasm,112.95,5.279
or some type of problem where it's,116.43,3.42
obstructing not just the nerves but the,118.229,3.811
blood vessels as well and it could also,119.85,5.309
be that you have poor circulation where,122.04,4.649
there's a clogged artery that's also,125.159,3.451
causing it but more than likely it's,126.689,4.29
going to be neurological so as you,128.61,3.9
change your diet in Duke,130.979,3.691
in fasting and if that still doesn't,132.51,3.0
clear it up,134.67,3.75
go get check for a pinched nerve or poor,135.51,6.36
circulation thanks for watching so if,138.42,5.19
