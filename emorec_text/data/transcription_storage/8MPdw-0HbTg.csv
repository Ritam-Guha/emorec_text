hey this is Sarah with registered nurse,5.3,4.15
orange comm and today I want to show you,7.68,5.07
how to give a subcu injection a subcu,9.45,5.399
injection also known as a subcutaneous,12.75,4.5
injection is an injection where that,14.849,4.951
goes into the fat of the skin it's,17.25,4.59
different than an intramuscular shot,19.8,4.889
which is given in a muscle so I'm going,21.84,4.89
to show you how that's done typically,24.689,5.761
heparin insulin lovenox those are given,26.73,6.09
in the fat of the skin today we're going,30.45,5.22
to give our mannequin Miss Smith a sub-q,32.82,5.1
injection of two units of regular,35.67,4.32
insulin and we're going to go in the,37.92,3.81
abdomen you can go in the back of the,39.99,5.25
arms you can go on the fat of the legs,41.73,5.31
or in the abdomen but I want to show you,45.24,3.84
how to do the abdomen first what you,47.04,3.3
want to do is you want to get your,49.08,2.999
medicine we've already drawn up two,50.34,4.41
units of insulin you want to get a,52.079,4.41
subcutaneous needle these should be in,54.75,3.81
your clean hole you'll want to get your,56.489,4.291
gloves do hand hygiene and get your,58.56,4.65
alcohol prep the end what you're going,60.78,4.11
to do is you're going to go to the,63.21,5.61
abdomen and you'll find the umbilical,64.89,6.3
area and you'll want to go two inches,68.82,5.88
away from the umbilical area and ask the,71.19,5.43
patient where's the last time they gave,74.7,3.93
you your shot because you don't want to,76.62,4.859
go in the same area she told me that,78.63,4.5
they went over here last time so this,81.479,3.901
time we're going to go on this side so,83.13,3.84
we're about two inches away from the,85.38,4.95
umbilical area what we're going to do is,86.97,5.55
we're going to clean the area for about,90.33,3.81
three to five seconds for the alcohol,92.52,4.26
prep in a nice circular motion keeping,94.14,6.12
it as clean as possible and this isn't a,96.78,5.22
sterile procedure you can use clean,100.26,5.43
gloves and we clean the area and then,102.0,6.869
we're going to get our syringe going to,105.69,8.34
take the cap off and you're sort of just,108.869,8.07
going to pinch the fat of the skin okay,114.03,5.46
and so just pinch that and you're going,116.939,4.711
to go in at a ninety degree angle like,119.49,4.98
you're throwing a dart so what we're,121.65,4.08
going to do is we're going to go,124.47,4.98
90 degrees no need to aspirate like how,125.73,6.12
you do with the IM injection just going,129.45,5.7
to give it take your needle out engage,131.85,7.61
the safety and put it in the sharps and,135.15,7.05
that is how you give a subcu injection,139.46,5.56
it's so easy and so simple take some,142.2,5.79
technique but after you get it down it's,145.02,5.34
easy so I hope you like this video if,147.99,3.57
you want to watch a video on how to,150.36,3.66
