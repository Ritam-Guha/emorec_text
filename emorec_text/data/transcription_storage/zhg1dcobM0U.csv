[Music],0.96,3.69
so in terms of specific,5.04,5.519
symptoms other than the deformities that,6.799,6.081
acromegaly,10.559,6.401
causes we look at sweating,12.88,7.12
there shouldn't be a reason for someone,16.96,3.44
to,20.0,3.279
start sweating more than usual when,20.4,4.639
there are middle-aged,23.279,5.281
or elderly adults,25.039,6.881
we also like to um,28.56,6.48
think of um,31.92,5.68
physical signs for example we shake the,35.04,3.6
patient's hand,37.6,3.119
when we uh when we see them in the,38.64,3.2
office,40.719,4.961
so you can feel that the pad that is,41.84,6.32
actually thicker in patients with,45.68,4.879
acromegaly compared to patients who,48.16,6.48
don't have acromegaly we like to look at,50.559,5.441
old pictures,54.64,4.079
because especially for patients that we,56.0,4.719
see for the first time,58.719,4.801
it it might not be easy to tell what,60.719,3.52
kind of,63.52,4.24
changes occurred,64.239,6.961
so those would be the main,67.76,7.92
things that that are specific,71.2,8.32
besides what we see in terms of clear,75.68,5.68
deformities,79.52,5.04
when you asked me about other,81.36,5.759
physicians or practitioners involved in,84.56,3.68
the patient's care,87.119,3.521
we actually looked at this with with our,88.24,4.72
study at emory where,90.64,5.519
where do patients come from which,92.96,4.479
physicians refer,96.159,4.721
them before the endocrinologist gets,97.439,4.561
involved,100.88,4.879
who is involved and the one interesting,102.0,7.52
um observation is that for women,105.759,6.72
especially those who are young still in,109.52,3.68
their,112.479,4.28
fertility years for women,113.2,6.959
gynecologists play an important role,116.759,5.801
or primary care physicians if that's,120.159,3.6
who's doing the,122.56,6.319
usual women's health checkups,123.759,8.401
what acromegaly causes in young women,128.879,6.401
is irregular periods sometimes,132.16,4.719
they go away completely so it's,135.28,3.12
amenorrhea,136.879,4.161
and sometimes even though the periods,138.4,3.76
stay,141.04,5.919
normal the problem is infertility,142.16,7.439
and while this tends to happen in both,146.959,3.201
women,149.599,3.841
and men the infertility i think,150.16,5.359
women are more likely to to seek,153.44,3.84
attention for this,155.519,3.841
from from a gynecologist or a,157.28,4.48
reproductive endocrinologist so we've,159.36,3.12
had,161.76,3.68
quite a few referrals from from these,162.48,3.52
women,165.44,3.92
who were actually seeking,166.0,6.4
medical attention for years before,169.36,7.519
and they were diagnosed with polycystic,172.4,7.44
ovarian syndrome pcos,176.879,6.321
now pcos is a lot more common in general,179.84,4.319
population,183.2,4.08
than acromegaly is,184.159,6.241
and pcos has a wide,187.28,4.8
is more like a syndrome there are,190.4,3.919
several criterias that could put one in,192.08,4.56
the pcos category and,194.319,5.441
many of those are clinical criteria,196.64,7.519
so one could easily miss acromegaly,199.76,7.039
in a in a patient who's otherwise been,204.159,4.0
told that they have,206.799,4.881
pcos so that's where i would,208.159,6.64
like to emphasize early differential,211.68,5.199
diagnosis,214.799,5.321
in um in women with,216.879,7.121
oligomenorrhea menorrhoear infertility,220.12,7.0
the dentists definitely um also play a,224.0,3.599
role,227.12,3.759
because why would the teeth become more,227.599,4.321
apart,230.879,4.56
or or shift there are situations when,231.92,6.64
when this is expected with the dental,235.439,4.08
work and,238.56,4.64
removal of teeth but many times,239.519,5.841
i think if that's accompanied by,243.2,3.44
prognosis or,245.36,4.879
the lower jaw moving forward that should,246.64,6.799
raise an alarm sign for,250.239,6.801
something medical going on maybe a tumor,253.439,12.961
that ex that secretes too much growth,257.04,9.36
