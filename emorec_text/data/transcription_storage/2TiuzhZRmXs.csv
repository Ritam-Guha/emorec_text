hello,3.439,3.36
this is dr daniel cotton and today i,4.48,4.64
want to talk about gastroparesis,6.799,4.081
most patients don't understand what,9.12,3.28
gastroparesis is,10.88,3.2
even though they've got this diagnosis,12.4,3.76
from either their gastroenterologist or,14.08,3.76
their primary care physician,16.16,2.8
today we want to go through,17.84,3.599
gastroparesis talk about its,18.96,6.159
etiology and what causes the symptoms,21.439,4.641
that you're facing,25.119,2.881
and then in subsequent videos we're,26.08,3.039
going to talk about,28.0,4.0
how we as surgeons treat gastroparesis,29.119,4.401
to relieve those symptoms,32.0,4.64
in a logical way what i've done now is,33.52,5.12
i've just done a simple diagram on the,36.64,2.88
stomach,38.64,2.48
and when we look at the stomach it's,39.52,3.44
divided into four parts we have the,41.12,2.959
fundus the body,42.96,3.919
the antrum and the pylorus and what the,44.079,5.121
basic problem is in gastroparesis,46.879,5.121
is the muscles of the body the stomach,49.2,3.92
and the fundus,52.0,3.92
go bad and this is the earliest thing,53.12,4.4
that happens to people when they start,55.92,3.68
notice that they can't digest their food,57.52,4.24
normally or have chronic abdominal pain,59.6,3.52
when they get the diagnosis of,61.76,3.759
gastroparesis is this is what's going on,63.12,3.84
and when we want to label,65.519,4.241
how this goes bad it's first the fundus,66.96,4.4
is the first part to go bad,69.76,4.24
the body is the second part to go back,71.36,4.799
the third part is actually the pylorus,74.0,3.52
which is the valve at the end of the,76.159,2.241
stomach,77.52,3.84
and the fourth part and last to go bad,78.4,5.2
is actually the antro,81.36,4.32
and when we start to think about the,83.6,4.24
symptoms of gastroparesis,85.68,3.759
they all start with the paralyzed,87.84,3.2
stomach and i've labeled that the first,89.439,3.36
problem of gastroparesis,91.04,5.2
the second problem comes from that issue,92.799,6.561
and that is the fact that we get rotten,96.24,3.76
fruit,99.36,2.64
in the stomach as a result of the,100.0,3.28
paralyzed stomach,102.0,3.04
that rotten food makes patients feel,103.28,3.92
very bad and makes them feel sick all,105.04,2.8
the time,107.2,2.0
and when they feel sick all the time,107.84,3.279
that's why they don't feel good all day,109.2,2.64
long,111.119,3.201
is because they're constantly nauseated,111.84,3.04
because,114.32,2.56
you have rotten food sitting in your,114.88,3.919
stomach and how could you feel good with,116.88,2.72
rotten foods,118.799,4.32
when you're stuck the third part,119.6,6.559
and i said goes bad third is the pylorus,123.119,5.2
now the polaris is a circular valve at,126.159,4.561
the end of the stomach it's primarily,128.319,5.681
there to control the blood sugar levels,130.72,4.48
in your body,134.0,3.44
and the interesting thing about this is,135.2,4.24
when the paralysis gradually goes down,137.44,2.96
the stomach,139.44,3.76
what happens when the pylorus gets,140.4,3.68
paralyzed,143.2,4.32
instead of opening up it constricts down,144.08,6.159
and i like to liken this to when you see,147.52,4.48
a person who's handicapped,150.239,4.801
and their arm is gone and spasm like,152.0,3.599
this,155.04,2.64
it's because they've been paralyzed in,155.599,3.841
such a way that their tricep and the,157.68,3.279
back arm can't straighten,159.44,4.4
so their bicep innervation is retained,160.959,4.56
and it just contracts in,163.84,3.52
and so what happens with this pylorus,165.519,3.521
when it goes bad,167.36,5.12
it spasms itself down and tell,169.04,6.0
nothing can go past it so i want to,172.48,4.96
illustrate you what happens if you have,175.04,5.76
gastroparesis and you're vomiting so,177.44,5.36
the antrum like i said is the last to go,180.8,3.84
bad so this pylorus,182.8,5.359
spasms down and it spasms down so it's,184.64,4.879
all closed,188.159,3.921
or almost all closed and so the antrum,189.519,4.881
still has some ability to squeeze,192.08,3.68
because it's the last place,194.4,3.839
to lose its innovation so all it does is,195.76,5.04
it squeezes the food against the pylorus,198.239,5.28
which then injects it up the esophagus,200.8,4.32
because it has nowhere to go,203.519,3.201
so when you talk about the symptoms of,205.12,3.52
gastroparesis we're talking about,206.72,3.04
symptoms from,208.64,4.56
rotten food and pylor spasm,209.76,5.8
and when we talk about the treatment for,213.2,3.52
gastroparesis,215.56,3.64
we have to find a way to treat number,216.72,4.48
one the symptoms of rotten food and,219.2,3.28
polar spasm,221.2,3.36
and we have to find a way to deal with,222.48,3.52
the paralyzed stomach,224.56,4.08
to allow the food to go through without,226.0,4.08
causing nausea,228.64,4.4
and food retention and so our subsequent,230.08,3.6
videos,233.04,2.32
after we have this short introduction,233.68,3.6
are going to deal with the ways that we,235.36,4.799
deal with these issues the issue of the,237.28,4.72
rotten through the bylaw spasm,240.159,3.761
and the paralyzed stomach they often,242.0,3.2
have symptoms due to,243.92,3.12
their colon and that's what i label,245.2,3.039
other so,247.04,2.96
the same problem that's causing their,248.239,4.241
stomach to lose its ability to contract,250.0,5.04
happens in their colon and so oftentimes,252.48,4.24
gastroparesis patients,255.04,3.759
will suffer from chronic very severe,256.72,3.199
constipation,258.799,3.361
and so in order to talk about dealing,259.919,4.401
with the whole gastroparesis patient,262.16,4.0
so many people want to throw drugs at,264.32,3.76
them but the actual truth is what we,266.16,3.44
need to talk about is treating their,268.08,2.16
whole,269.6,3.36
gastrointestinal system in order to get,270.24,3.28
them,272.96,3.12
in a place so they can actually function,273.52,4.32
in daily life without being in chronic,276.08,2.32
pain,277.84,2.56
and chronic constipation so these are,278.4,3.68
the things which we need to deal with,280.4,3.68
whenever we talk about them we're the,282.08,3.76
only people that do this in the state of,284.08,2.399
utah,285.84,3.04
and most of the state surrounded we've,286.479,3.44
seen large,288.88,3.12
amounts of success with these patients,289.919,4.081
and we'd love to do a consult either in,292.0,2.8
person,294.0,3.6
or via telemedicine thanks for tuning in,294.8,7.52
have a good day,297.6,4.72
