hi I'm Stephanie and the physical,12.559,3.941
therapist that in motion LC and today,14.58,3.24
I'm going to educate you a little bit on,16.5,3.6
performer alpha P so personal morality,17.82,4.44
is a big fancy word that really just,20.1,4.71
refers to a diseased or damaged and two,22.26,4.83
peripheral nerves so there are nerves on,24.81,4.17
multiple layers of the spine that run,27.09,3.449
out from their sign two different,28.98,4.02
muscles in your hands arms legs feet,30.539,4.381
kind of run all the way out and control,33.0,4.17
the motions on that take place in your,34.92,4.229
upper and lower body so with this,37.17,4.799
disease progresses kind of in a stacking,39.149,4.771
our gloves pattern starts in their hands,41.969,3.481
and your feet and kind of moves upwards,43.92,3.78
it's most common with people on with,45.45,4.289
diabetes it can be due to variety of,47.7,4.499
causes different Texas cities on,49.739,4.201
different infections so there are lots,52.199,3.211
of different causes the diabetes is,53.94,3.869
definitely on the big one so this takes,55.41,4.289
over and not only affects the sensory,57.809,3.511
part of the nerves but also the motor,59.699,2.971
there's two different components of,61.32,3.869
every nerve with the sensation it can be,62.67,4.59
really undamaged because you're not,65.189,4.261
really able to tell when your foot is in,67.26,3.929
contact with something for an example,69.45,3.66
you might have a rock in your shoe and,71.189,3.811
forearm you knew we'd be able to tell,73.11,3.57
right away that the rock is in the shoe,75.0,2.97
you want to have you know take your shoe,76.68,4.079
off or I move our feet around but people,77.97,4.829
with this damage they don't necessarily,80.759,4.751
know that is fair to looking pod,82.799,4.871
of course an alternate Cardinal break,85.51,3.96
through the skin and then it won't,87.67,3.72
necessarily feel as well because there,89.47,3.63
doesn't have that same type of sensation,91.39,3.87
so if you really lead to a lot of damage,93.1,5.16
going further into you know progress all,95.26,4.77
servers imputation it can be very,98.26,4.59
serious so this is something that is,100.03,4.02
really important to make sure you're,102.85,3.27
taken care of right away foot care is,104.05,3.48
essential for people with peripheral,106.12,4.11
neuropathy and it also impacts more the,107.53,5.07
motor component of being able to move,110.23,4.65
your feet and toes and the way you need,112.6,4.8
to so that it would be an area that we,114.88,4.08
look at making sure you're keeping the,117.4,3.84
strength that means your ability to move,118.96,4.019
and kind of live your life that's really,121.24,4.35
our focus here and fall risk is another,122.979,4.051
huge one because you don't necessarily,125.59,3.9
have feeling on the bottom of your feet,127.03,4.29
your most mere muscles aren't able to,129.49,3.87
control your foot in April as well and,131.32,3.66
then you don't have the awareness called,133.36,3.06
proprioception you really don't know,134.98,3.54
where your foot is in space all three of,136.42,4.32
those components really make us you at a,138.52,4.35
larger risk for experiencing a fault,140.74,4.02
which of course is nothing that we want,142.87,4.8
to have happen so here at emotional OC,144.76,4.86
all reputable therapists are experts,147.67,3.75
with this condition a lot of different,149.62,3.57
techniques be there kind of helped,151.42,4.56
openers maintain their function learn,153.19,5.34
different from most motor patterns or,155.98,4.38
commencer ways to make sure that you're,158.53,4.92
staying active staying healthy avoiding,160.36,4.92
any Falls and of course avoiding a new,163.45,4.26
sort of ulcer so come on in motion,165.28,4.75
p for free consultation,167.71,13.26
