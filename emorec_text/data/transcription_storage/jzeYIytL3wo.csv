"Cerebral Edema in Diabetic Ketoacidosis, by
Dr. Michael Agus.",23.18,5.54
"Hi, and welcome. I'll be speaking today about
diabetic ketoacidosis or DKA. My name is Michael",28.72,8.83
"Agus. I am a pediatric intensive care doctor
and a Pediatric Endocrinologist at Boston",37.55,5.97
"Children's Hospital. I'm the Director of the
Medicine Critical Care program here at Children's",43.52,5.02
"and an Assistant Professor at Harvard Medical
School.",48.54,4.43
"Now, what does a patient succumb from? What
do they die of? In general, cerebral edema.",52.97,10.03
Literature Review.,63.0,1.18
"There have been three major studies in the
literature over the past several years, fairly",64.18,5.579
"large studies, but retrospective, totaling
about 11,000 patients. And together, they",69.759,5.431
"seem to demonstrate that there's about a 1%
incidence of significant cerebral edema among",75.19,4.76
"patients who present with DKA. Among those
who get significant cerebral edema, about",79.95,5.72
40% will die or have a severe neurologic outcome.,85.67,2.949
"If you do the math, that's a net population
mortality of about 0.4%. A more recent study",88.619,8.911
"by a colleague of mine here at Children's,
Dr. DeCourcey, looked at a PHIS database review.",97.53,6.089
"PHIS is an administrative database we have
access to in the US. Was able to look at a",103.619,5.661
"total of just over 37,000 DKA patients in
a single study.",109.28,5.1
"And to our surprise, we found a significant
increased incidence of significant cerebral",114.38,5.02
"edema defined as edema that prompted therapy
of either Mannitol or hypertonic saline by",119.4,8.469
"a practicing clinician. Fourfold increase
in the incidence, but a 10% mortality. So",127.869,9.611
"a significantly reduced mortality. And on
the face, that looks like good news. We're",137.48,3.92
"treating more patients and they're doing better.
But again, when one does the math, basically",141.4,4.66
"we haven't changed the ultimate mortality
at all.",146.06,2.66
"We're treating four times as many patients.
They're one quarter as likely to have a bad",148.72,6.28
"outcome, and ultimately 0.4% population mortality.
So despite our advances over the decades,",155.0,7.22
"it's not clear that we've made a major impact
in overall mortality. But these numbers are",162.22,7.269
"low, and it's easy to have had even a 30%
or 40% effect on mortality and have that really",169.489,6.81
be difficult to detect with these studies.,176.299,3.66
Risk Factors for Cerebral Edema.,179.959,2.201
"Now, what are the known risk factors for cerebral
edema? Well, again back to Dr. Glaser's paper,",182.16,6.82
"from 2001. Now, she identified four major
risk factors in children with significant",188.98,5.55
"cerebral edema. Three of them are shown here.
A high BUN, a low PaCO2, and treatment with",194.53,8.769
"bicarbonate. Now we know that a high BUN is
associated with someone who's dehydrated.",203.299,7.601
"How about a low PaCO2? That's someone who
has a very low pH. And they're hyperventilating",210.9,5.489
"and dropping their PaCO2 so that they can
blow off some of that additional acid. And",216.389,5.241
"who gets treated with bicarbonate? Those who
the lowest pH.",221.63,4.68
"So although these were independent risk factors,
the reality is that all three of them correlate,",226.31,5.95
"really quite directly, with severity of illness.
And while they may be independent risk factors,",232.26,6.009
"as clinicians, we look at patients and are
message is the more dehydrated, the more acidotic",238.269,6.701
"they are, the more at risk they are. The fourth
risk factor was the one that really kind of",244.97,5.65
"threw us for a loop. Fourth risk factor, if
you notice, demonstrates a lower relative",250.62,6.929
"risk when the serum sodium rises by more than
5.8 per hour. The prior three risk factors",257.549,10.061
"I showed you, if they were true, the relative
risk is increased.",267.61,4.13
"In this case, when it's true the relative
risk decreases. What that suggests is that",271.74,4.489
"a serum sodium rise of 5.8 per hour is a good
thing. Now, we measure serum sodium every",276.229,8.141
"two hours. And that would mean that we would
have a change of 12, almost 12 millimoles",284.37,9.68
"per liter, over a two hour period. And that means
patient comes in with serum sodium 125, you",294.05,5.649
"check it again a couple hours later, it's
137. That is an extraordinary change. And",299.699,5.97
"as a clinician, I would posit that this is
not, in my experience, a degree of change",305.669,6.87
"in serum sodium that we see very commonly
at all. So what do we with this risk factor?",312.539,4.831
"Does it only apply when the serum sodium rises
so dramatically to an extent that we almost",317.37,6.569
never see?,323.939,1.051
"Instead, we can look at it from a little bit
of a different point of view. If you come",324.99,5.35
"over here and look at this graph I'll show
you what I mean. So if we look at the evolution",330.34,8.289
"of sodium and glucose concentrations over
time, in the setting of DKA, we can think",338.629,5.0
"about it from a point of view of being above
and below normal. So if we consider this to",343.629,6.931
"be a normal range, and we start with a glucose
concentration that is quite high, we know",350.56,14.12
"from our discussion that the serum sodium
will be relatively low.",364.7,6.2
"And the idea in resolution of DKA is that
as the glucose comes down into the normal",372.42,10.78
"range, the serum sodium ought to rise. The
reason the serum sodium is low to begin with,",383.21,7.9
"you will recall, is that glucose is an osmotic
agent that pulls water into the bloodstream,",391.11,6.279
"deluding everything that's in the bloodstream.
So it's going to dilute sodium. It's going",397.389,4.101
"to dilute potassium and chloride as well.
But sodium is the most obvious, the most prominent.",401.49,6.79
"And as glucose comes out of the extremely
high range, into the normal range, the exact",408.28,6.59
same thing ought to happen with sodium.,414.87,2.82
"The risk factor that we were discussing earlier,
is when glucose begins to come down but sodium",424.689,9.051
"does not come up at the same rate. If sodium
comes up a little bit and kind of flattens",433.74,8.109
"out that is considered invocation of the risk
factor that sodium has not risen fast enough.",441.849,9.551
"And this is considered a risk factor for developing
significant cerebral edema. One way to follow",451.4,12.049
"the relationship between the hyperglycemia
and the hyponatremia, over time, is to look",463.449,5.761
at the corrected serum sodium.,469.22,6.069
"One way to think about the sodium changes
that we talked about are to look at a value",475.3,5.679
"that we refer to as the corrected sodium.
Corrected sodium answers the question, what",480.979,5.321
"would the serum sodium be if glucose was normal?
We use a formula to calculate this. And we",486.3,8.049
"say, we take the serum sodium, and look at
the serum glucose, and we say, see how many",494.349,6.22
"100s over 100 is the serum glucose. And multiply
that times 2 and add it to the serum sodium.",500.569,5.981
"And we get our corrected sodium. For example,
serum sodium is 125 and the blood sugar is",506.55,5.96
"900. Well, that's 800 over 100. So 8 times
2 is 16. We add 16 to the 125, we get 141.",512.51,11.279
"So the corrected sodium in this example is
141, while the measured sodium is 125.",523.789,7.281
"A question that's often asked in the situation
is, which is a real? Which is the real serum",531.07,5.31
"sodium? The answer is, very definitively,
that the serum sodium is 125. The sodium that",536.38,7.34
"the brain is seeing, it's 125. What would
the sodium be if the glucose was normal? 141.",543.72,7.52
"But the glucose isn't normal. The glucose
is 900. And so, right now, the serum sodium",551.24,5.89
"is quite low. The way we use the measured,
the way we use the corrected sodium to think",557.13,7.98
"about this risk factor is to say, the corrected
sodium should be normal and stay normal.",565.11,7.37
"If, as we saw on the graph, the glucose comes
down and the serum sodium does not rise adequately,",572.48,9.81
"that should be reflected in a corrected sodium
that is low. So if there were corrected sodium",582.29,4.78
"drops below 137, 138, we really need to get
ourselves to the bedside, do a thorough neurological",587.07,8.15
"exam, and determine whether or not this patient
has symptoms of significant cerebral edema.",595.22,5.95
"And think about treating at that point. But
this risk factor is really only present when",601.17,7.69
this the sodium does not rise sufficiently.,608.86,2.52
"Now you may ask, why would I not just give
sodium? Well, there's nothing, I don't have",611.38,9.269
"any data to suggest that one should not treat
this scenario with sodium. But I will tell",620.649,6.721
"you that every study that has ever looked
at rate of sodium administration has not found",627.37,4.49
"it to be a predictor of significant cerebral
edema. We are physicians, and when something",631.86,8.43
"is low, and it's a bad sign, then our inclination
is to treat it, to bring it up. The best example,",640.29,9.82
"the best analogy I could think of is a patient
with meningitis.",650.11,4.229
"Let's just say that an eight-year-old has
meningitis and has a CSF white count to 10,000.",654.339,6.42
"Now, you know that a high CSF white count
is a very poor prognosticator and significant",660.759,7.311
"risk factor. I will give you the choice. You
can either treat this patient with ceftriaxone",668.07,4.37
"or you can plasmapharese the CSF. Which are
you going to choose? You're going to choose",672.44,7.11
"the ceftriaxone because you understand that
the problem here is that there are bacteria",679.55,5.399
"that are eating part of the brain, and causing
a massive amount of inflammation that is putting",684.949,5.0
"the patient at risk for a severe outcome.
The white cells are only a symptom of the",689.949,5.541
underlying pathology.,695.49,1.67
"I would posit to you that is really the exact
same thing that's going on here. When the",697.16,4.619
"sodium fails to rise normally it is not the
problem. It is a symptom of the problem. And",701.779,6.131
"it is very likely connected to inappropriate
ADH secretion that is triggered by an injured",707.91,9.25
"brain. And a brain that is becoming more and
more, either ischemic or significant swelling",717.16,8.239
"with a significant pressure building up, triggering
release of ADH, an inability to allow the",725.399,7.831
"kidney to clear adequate free water. That
doesn't get any closer to a treatment approach,",733.23,7.07
"but it does point out that the failure of
sodium to rise has not been shown to be a",740.3,6.81
"component of the pathology, rather a symptom
or a sign of the pathology. Having said all",747.11,7.649
"that, when we see serum sodium fail to rise
or a corrected sodium that begins to drop,",754.759,7.211
"the right approach, because we don't have
any better data, is to increase the concentration",761.97,5.19
"of sodium chloride in the fluids that we're
delivering. And we'll talk about that more",767.16,4.679
in a minute.,771.839,0.56
"The other findings of this study were interesting
in that there was a whole slew of the risk",774.6,5.929
"factors that were not identified as being
significant. You see those on the screen.",780.529,6.331
"And importantly, they include initial glucose.
It's very helpful for clinicians, over the",786.86,6.39
"years, to understand that a glucose of 1,200
is no more risky than a glucose of 600. What",793.25,5.99
"matters is the degree of acidosis, degree
of dehydration, the factors that we talked",799.24,4.74
"about before. As of this study, deciding on giving
an insulin bolus didn't attribute increased",803.98,7.539
"risk. The rate of insulin infusion didn't
seem to matter. Rate of IV fluid, even the",811.519,4.101
"rate of sodium administration, as I mentioned.",815.62,3.649
"One important caveat to a retrospective study,
however, is that one can only measure within",819.269,5.451
"the range that was done. Now rate of IV fluid,
for example, was not shown to be a significant",824.72,5.669
"risk factor. But in animal models, we know
that if we give a massive amount of fluid",830.389,4.661
"to patients with DKA we will engender a lot
of significant cerebral edema. And so why",835.05,7.11
"did that not happened here? Why was that not
noticed here? And I think the answer is that",842.16,4.51
"patients in this study didn't give a massive
amount, didn't receive a massive amount of",846.67,4.51
IV fluid.,851.18,1.98
"And as result, in a retrospective study when
one is practicing within reason, you may not",853.16,9.95
"pick up a lot of unreasonable practices. There's
a similar study done by Dr. Julie Edge, in",863.11,9.36
"Europe. She found similar risk factors, but
two slightly different ones that are worth",872.47,5.47
"mentioning. One, is she noted a trend towards
higher risk in younger patients. And that's",877.94,5.209
"something that intuitively we believed. That
a younger patient with a full diaper and good",883.149,4.291
"urine output is not considered to be sick
patient. We see that all the time. And also,",887.44,6.319
"that new onset diabetics are at higher risk
for developing significant cerebral edema.",893.759,4.971
"Again, presumably due to delayed presentation
because the families are not skilled in noticing",898.73,4.859
the symptoms of evolving DKA.,903.589,4.08
Diagnosis of DKA.,908.7,1.22
"Now, a patient is admitted. They're in your
unit. What signs are you really looking for",909.92,5.339
"to diagnose cerebral edema at the time, and
to consider therapy? Well, Dr. Muir reviewed",915.259,7.02
"a bunch of really severe cases, and came up
with a set of diagnostic criteria. Now, I",922.279,7.461
"don't advocate for the strict use of this
particular protocol and particular formula,",929.74,9.349
"but the lists are quite helpful and quite
informative.",939.089,3.29
"On the diagnostic column, we have some symptoms
that I think all of us would jump in and treat",942.379,6.561
"pretty instantaneously. If patient's unresponsive
to pain, if patient has decorticate or decerebrate",948.94,5.639
"posturing, if a patient has a new cranial
nerve palsy. And finally, if they have a neurogenic",954.579,6.61
"respiratory pattern, which is really something
close to agonal respiratory pattern. And of",961.189,4.19
"course, that is the third component of Cushing's
triad.",965.379,3.801
"The second component being bradycardia, and
Dr. Meir actually quantifies this is a change",969.18,6.49
"of greater than 20 beats per minute from baseline.
And then the first component Cushing's triad,",975.67,5.109
"which is actually extremely common, is hypertension,
quantified by him as a diastolic blood pressure",980.779,6.591
"greater than 90. Despite patient presenting
with hypovolemia and dehydration, they curiously",987.37,8.769
"have increased systemic vascular resistance,
increased tone, and have relative hypertension.",996.139,7.911
"The other major risk factors are interesting.
Significantly altered mentation, mental status,",1004.05,7.92
"and then age dependent incontinence. This
one struck me when I first read the paper,",1011.97,5.2
"because patients will often come in in the
evening and at night, and you take a 5-year-old",1017.17,6.469
"who's been toilet trained and give them the
worst night of their life, you keep them up",1023.639,4.731
"all night, you give them a huge amount of
fluids, they have a pH of 7.1, and they wet",1028.37,4.41
"the bed, is that really meaningful? And it
turns out from this data that it is. And so",1032.78,5.11
"that's become one additional item that we
focus on in our hospital, and that nurses",1037.89,6.01
and house staff are really quite attuned to.,1043.9,5.06
"The minor criteria are pretty common. Vomiting,
headache, lethargy, not being easily aroused.",1048.96,9.24
"In my own estimation when I do a neurologic
exam for a patient, I will stimulate the patient",1058.2,6.63
"to whatever extent they need. But if even
after a significant simulation, they are then",1064.83,4.7
"able to answer questions appropriately, meaning
birthday, where they are, what they're doing",1069.53,6.98
"here, name, that sort of thing, then I tend
to allow their mental status to be characterized",1076.51,7.62
"as acceptable. He also noticed that children
at a young age were at increase risk, as we've",1084.13,8.48
seen before.,1092.61,2.04
Development of DKA.,1094.84,2.22
"When does one get this significant event,
the cerebral edema? Well in Dr. Glazers paper",1097.8,7.55
"she noticed that several had it when they
walked into the ED. Meaning, it can't be true",1105.39,6.18
"that all significant cerebral edema is related
to therapy. And it leads to the idea that",1111.57,7.34
"there's something about the patient, something
about-- we've mentioned before, the size of",1118.91,4.97
"the skull, the amount of extra axial space.",1123.88,2.93
"And it may have more to do with the severity
of the acidosis. And how long they've been",1126.81,7.49
"ill. All these factors, we haven't been able
to identify, but what we can tell you is that",1134.3,5.82
"some patients will get significant edema without
any therapy.",1140.12,5.43
"The bulk of events, meaning development of
significant edema, occur within the first",1145.55,5.15
"six hours. By hour 12, 13, you're really largely
out of the woods. But there are some stragglers.",1150.7,8.22
"And those tend to be patients who just aren't
quite responding fully. Their course ends",1158.92,7.43
"up being a little bit longer than you might
expect. But those are few and far between.",1166.35,6.84
Therapies for DKA,1173.2,2.92
"Now what happens if we believe we have a patient
with significant cerebral edema? We have a",1177.0,4.7
"blown pupil, we have decorticate posturing,
we have a patient who's unresponsive. Well,",1181.7,5.12
"then we need to call for our appropriate supports,
local supports, hospital supports, so that",1186.82,5.59
"if we do need to take an airway, we're able
to do that. But we also call for the appropriate",1192.41,7.59
therapy.,1200.0,0.3
"Now, what is the appropriate first line therapy?
There are two competing therapies out there",1200.3,4.64
"right now, one is mannitol and one is 3% hypertonic
saline. While 3% hypertonic saline has some",1204.94,10.09
"reasonable data that has been reported with
it in traumatic brain injury, there are hardly",1215.03,5.08
"any data reported with its use in diabetic
ketoacidosis. As a result and also as a result",1220.11,7.69
"of some data I'll show you in a minute, I
use first line therapy as mannitol. We use",1227.8,6.56
1 gram per kilo and we infuse it over 15 minutes.,1234.36,4.1
"Please remember that mannitol sitting on a
shelf for a long period time can form some",1238.46,3.94
"crystals, and so when one draws it from the
vile, one needs to use a needle with a filter.",1242.4,7.77
"And it is very well tolerated. It does result
in increased urine output during the hours",1250.17,5.52
"that follow, and so one has to keep track
of that hypovolemia that may follow my mannitol",1255.69,4.82
administration.,1260.52,1.12
"Second line therapy if mannitol does not work
is 3% saline. There is some debate on what",1261.9,5.86
"the actual recommended dose of 3% saline is.
An equimolar dose to the mannitol does that",1267.76,6.09
"we've use over the years is 5 mL per kilo.
Now, again, we infuse it over 15 minutes.",1273.85,7.4
"However, in this particular case, if a patient's
mental status improves, I would halt the infusion",1281.25,6.51
"immediately. One does not want to run the
risk of central pontine myelinolysis by acutely",1287.76,7.27
"raising the serum sodium any further than
needed to restore a reasonable mental status.",1295.03,9.63
"If the patient does not respond and they lose
their airway reflexes, intubation may be warranted",1304.66,7.91
"and one wants to use an agent that takes into
account the increased intracranial pressure,",1312.57,4.98
"for example, thiopental with or without the
use of lidocaine. After intubation, I would",1317.55,5.13
"hyperventilate down to the end-tidal CO2 that
the patient had prior to losing their mental",1322.68,7.51
"status. Hyperventilation, while not a standard
therapy for increased intracranial pressure",1330.19,6.13
"in cerebral edema is exactly what this patient
has been doing for many hours prior to losing",1336.32,5.25
"their mental status, and so while one doesn't
want to go beyond what they were doing, one",1341.57,5.47
"wants to go back to what they were doing and
then slowly raise it over time, as they would",1347.04,6.51
do if they were conscious.,1353.55,2.5
"Finally, head CT is really not necessarily
part of the algorithm. The decision to treat",1356.05,8.86
"ought to be made based on clinical symptoms.
The head CT can show significant cerebral",1364.91,6.55
"edema on virtually any patient with DKA, and
so the presence or absence on CT is not going",1371.46,5.71
"to guide therapy. If patient has edema but
is alert and awake, you're not going to treat,",1377.17,4.72
"and if a patient is obtunded and non-responsive
and the CT is negative, you are going to treat.",1381.89,5.37
"And so again, treat based on clinical symptomatology.",1387.26,4.79
"The debate between mannitol and 3% saline
really is an active one, and in looking at",1392.05,4.62
"some retrospective data over the last decade,
it looks like in the United States the use",1396.67,5.26
"of 3% saline has gone up quite dramatically,
especially in the last few years. However,",1401.93,6.57
"in looking at the survival or the odds ratio
for survival when using one therapy over the",1408.5,6.34
"other, there is a hint in this admittedly
retrospective database study that there is",1414.84,6.97
"an increased mortality with the use of hypertonic
saline as first line therapy. That has contributed",1421.81,9.31
"to our decision here to use mannitol exclusively
as first line therapy.",1431.12,5.62
Therapies for DKA: Update.,1438.0,3.14
"At the end of 2013, we published a retrospective
analysis of mortality in DKA which revealed",1441.66,7.47
