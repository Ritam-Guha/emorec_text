i'm felicia derose and i'm going to,2.159,4.481
share a few of my favorite tips on how,4.24,6.48
to manage diabetes through food,6.64,4.08
if you're newly diagnosed with diabetes,10.96,4.0
and you feel like you already have a,13.36,3.759
busy schedule trust me i understand i,14.96,4.239
had a busy life before diabetes came in,17.119,4.401
and was like hold up everything else,19.199,3.761
everything else,21.52,4.64
comes second to diabetes and so,22.96,6.239
oftentimes as busy as my world is i have,26.16,4.72
to remember,29.199,3.281
that yes i'm packing my daughter's,30.88,4.16
snacks for school but i also need to,32.48,5.12
pack my snack right like,35.04,5.12
she can't get a snack packed for her if,37.6,6.2
mommy's not here,40.16,3.64
when it comes to a,45.36,5.519
diabetic diet i don't use the word diet,47.76,5.439
it's a meal plan it's an option there's,50.879,5.281
the plate method the glycemic index and,53.199,5.52
carb counting the plate method is the,56.16,6.0
simplest one the plate is nine inches,58.719,6.881
half of it is vegetables 25 is the carb,62.16,5.76
and then 25 is protein that makes the,65.6,5.28
plate then there's carb counting carb,67.92,5.12
counting is about figuring out how many,70.88,5.12
carbs are in each food then there's a,73.04,5.84
glycemic index this one is a little bit,76.0,6.32
challenging but because i love cherries,78.88,6.08
and i love grapes i had to figure out,82.32,5.76
how many grapes if they're green grapes,84.96,5.28
purple grapes they all have a different,88.08,5.2
level of sweetness,90.24,3.04
there are these things that are on my i,95.759,4.801
don't eat that anymore list and i make,98.24,5.519
sure that i don't bring them home,100.56,5.76
when i go grocery shopping i read the,103.759,5.201
labels i'm constantly like reading the,106.32,5.6
food label and trying to figure out,108.96,6.479
how much of this item can i have that,111.92,6.72
fits into my 45 grams of carbs that i,115.439,4.801
eat per meal,118.64,3.759
a tip for you when you go grocery,120.24,4.64
shopping is to shop on the outside where,122.399,5.761
there is fresh foods before you go,124.88,5.999
inside the lines where you have packaged,128.16,3.68
foods,130.879,2.481
so if you start on the outside and you,131.84,3.039
have your protein,133.36,4.239
then you have your vegetables by the,134.879,4.641
time you look at your cart,137.599,3.28
it's pretty much,139.52,3.92
full so there's less room for canned,140.879,4.481
food or packaged foods and these kinds,143.44,4.4
of things,145.36,2.48
if i'm in a restaurant that has a menu,150.72,5.84
i first look at the appetizers like how,153.2,5.84
many carbs are in these appetizers,156.56,4.8
if there's an app available that can,159.04,4.479
tell me the amount of carbs,161.36,4.959
in that meal great if the menu has it,163.519,7.121
printed on there even more fantastic,166.319,5.521
i always,170.64,3.28
view dessert as,171.84,5.36
it's my entire carb count for the meal,173.92,5.12
so if i want to have something like,177.2,4.8
dessert i'll end up with a salad,179.04,5.36
whenever there is a buffet,182.0,6.08
i scan the buffet first because what i,184.4,5.6
found is that people tend to put the,188.08,4.72
heavy carb foods at the end so if you,190.0,5.12
don't scan and you start off and you,192.8,4.64
take some carbs for an appetizer section,195.12,4.16
and then you move on down and then you,197.44,4.24
have carbs for the meal by the time you,199.28,4.319
get to the end where the dessert is or,201.68,4.479
the fruit or something like this,203.599,4.321
you're out of carbs,206.159,2.481
so,207.92,3.36
when i'm carb counting i'm not depriving,208.64,6.08
myself of any carbs i'm exchanging,211.28,6.879
the carbs so i'm exchanging bread for,214.72,7.76
rice i'm exchanging potatoes for pasta i,218.159,9.241
can eat it all but in moderation,222.48,4.92
sometimes i get the diabetes management,228.799,5.52
right some days are smooth sailing and,230.879,6.161
then there are other days where i'm like,234.319,5.521
it just didn't pan out perfectly today,237.04,5.199
why in the world did i eat that,239.84,5.039
chocolate chip cookie last night and i'm,242.239,5.121
just trying not to beat myself up trying,244.879,5.28
to remind myself that diabetes is hard,247.36,4.159
and i don't,250.159,2.8
and i don't need,251.519,4.401
to ruin my entire day,252.959,4.96
and in those times,255.92,4.08
i just have to say,257.919,4.56
one day is not the end of the world so,260.0,5.04
if you mess up breakfast you have lunch,262.479,4.881
if you mess up lunch you have dinner if,265.04,4.159
you mess up breakfast lunch and dinner,267.36,4.16
in that day you have the next day to get,269.199,4.401
it right so that's constantly what i'm,271.52,3.92
telling myself i have another,273.6,4.159
opportunity to get it right,275.44,5.28
and i'm gonna get it right the next time,277.759,5.601
