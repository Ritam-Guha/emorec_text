"Hello, my name is Carleton Rivers and I am a registered dietitian with NCHPAD.",17.752,4.074
"Today we are going to be discussing how to 
 improve your diet after a diagnosis of diabetes.",21.826,4.87
Now these strategies are not just for those with diabetes.,26.696,2.967
"I encourage everyone to apply these tips to their 
 diet every day. So let's get started. ",29.663,5.189
"The first thing that you want to remember is 
 to monitor the amount of carbohydrates you eat.",34.906,5.707
"That way you are able to control your 
 blood glucose levels or blood sugar levels.",40.613,4.769
So what is a carbohydrate?,45.382,1.568
"Well carbohydrates are found in bread, rice, and pasta",46.95,4.959
"and other starchy things like potatoes, corn, and 
 legumes which are beans and peas. ",51.909,6.841
"Carbohydrates are also found in sweet foods and drinks like 
 fruit, milk, and yogurt, as well as ",58.75,7.536
"sugar sweetened beverages, fruit juice, and some candy, 
 and of course and sweet desserts. ",66.286,6.821
"So the type of diet I'm going to be 
 emphasizing today is the mediterranean style diet.",73.107,4.516
Now this diet has huge amounts of research that have shown wonderful benefits,77.623,5.043
"in improving cardiovascular health, and also increasing insulin sensitivity. ",82.666,5.111
Which is necessary for someone with type 2 diabetes. ,87.777,3.172
"A mediterranean style diet is rich in seasonal fruits and vegetables, whole grains, ",90.949,5.707
healthy fats like fish and nuts and avocados. and then it's gonna be ,96.656,7.634
"moderate amounts of cheese, and dairy products like milk and yogurt",104.294,5.306
"it's gonna be moderate amounts of lean protein and eggs, and 
 then just minimal amounts of red meat and sweets.",109.601,7.079
"So if you notice over here, there still are 
 carbohydrates in the mediterranean style diet. ",116.678,5.602
And this is where carb counting comes into play. ,122.277,2.903
"So, I find that carb counting is the best way 
 to monitor the amount of carbohydrates you eat ",125.183,6.637
"and drink at meal time and for snacks. So what I 
 have done here is I have portioned out the ",131.82,5.88
carbohydrate containing foods into one carb serving. So what does that mean?,137.697,5.503
"Well, 15 grams of carbohydrates equals 1 carb serving. ",143.2,5.14
"So let's take this piece of bread for instance. This 
 piece of bread contains about 15 grams of carbohydrates",149.291,5.889
"So we'll say this is one carb serving. Now if 
 you're recommended to consume 2 carb servings for breakfast",155.169,7.171
Then you want to limit your carbohydrate intake to 30 grams that breakfast.,162.336,5.124
"The American Diabetes Association recommends a good starting point 
 as 3 to 5 carb servings per meal",167.455,7.615
"That would be a sandwich made out of 2 slices of 
 bread, you could put meat and cheese in it, ",175.07,7.35
"along with a bunch of non-starchy vegetables, and 
 then a small side of fruit. ",182.407,5.653
"And there you go. You have 3 carb servings. So, what 
 I'm gonna do today, is I'm going to show you",188.097,5.593
how to make the most out of this diet. ,193.69,2.97
"So I'm going to take, a little over one cup of 
 spinach, and then I'm going to grab some tomatoes",196.663,9.237
and a raddish. ,205.905,2.905
"And what's great about these vegetables, is that they're very low in carbohydrates.",210.64,4.18
"So we call them 'Free Foods', you can pretty much eat as 
 much as you want of these foods and not raise ",214.824,6.936
your blood glucose levels. So I'm going to add this to the salad. ,221.755,4.565
"And I always love adding a salad to any meal 
 because it just helps fill you up. ",227.291,4.609
"So we're gonna slice up some of this radish,  and add 
 it to the salad. And then we're gonna grab some ",231.905,7.235
"walnuts, which are filled with really healthy fat, they're 
 really great for your brain health. ",239.144,6.896
"and to raise your good cholesterol, your HDL cholesterol. So I'm just going 
 to crush some of that. Now one serving size is about",246.045,7.535
"one palm-full. Which is one ounce of nuts. And then I'm gonna 
 add in some mozzarella cheese. Just slice it up. ",253.584,9.016
"And sprinkle it on. And then we're gonna do salad dressing, 
 so, it's really just one tablespoon of olive oil",262.596,7.234
"and a half a tablespoon of balsamic vinegar 
 or whatever vinegar that you prefer. ",269.832,6.058
"So I'm going to drizzle it over, and now of course 
 you can buy salad dressing in the grocery store",275.887,6.393
"but it's probably more expensive and if you get the low-fat version, 
 then it is going to be high in sugar. ",282.284,5.386
"So I say go with homemade, it's usually better anyways. ",287.668,3.572
"So I'm also gonna add in about 3 ounces of 
 salmon fillet. And so there you go. ",291.239,8.901
"So, this meal actually does not have many carbohydrates. It does 
 not even have a full 1 carb serving. ",300.137,7.343
"So if you want to add carbohydrates to this meal, you could add",307.483,3.697
"half of a sweet potato, which is about 15 grams of carbohydrates",311.184,4.556
"You could add one cup of strawberries, which is one carb serving. ",315.742,4.438
And then you could add half a cup of grapes.,320.182,4.768
"So not all fruits are created equal. There are some 
 that are higher in carbohydrates than others. ",325.35,5.47
"there are some that are higher in carbohydrates than others. For instance,",327.954,3.436
"berries are going to have the lowest amounts of carbohydrates 
 whereas grapes are a bit higher and ",331.386,5.544
"so are bananas, so one carb serving of banana, 
 is gonna be half of a banana. ",336.926,5.124
"And then for an apple, one small apple, 
 it's gonna be one carb serving. ",342.051,5.149
"So if you have a big apple, you're probably gonna want to 
 cut it in half to monitor your carbohydrate intake.  ",347.203,5.877
"So remember, when you're trying to make a lifestyle change involving your diet",353.075,4.805
"It's not that difficult, look at all of the 
 wonderful food that you get to eat. ",357.881,4.539
"All you have to do is make sure you're eating 
 nutrient rich foods. So, high in vitamins and minerals",362.421,5.459
"the yummy fruits and vegetables, whole grains.. Things that 
 are going to fill you up ",367.883,5.157
"and keep you satisfied. They're also going to improve your 
 health and just make you feel better. ",373.039,5.251
"So when you're adjusting your diet to control your blood 
 glucose levels or your blood sugar levels, ",378.294,5.356
"go low in carbohydrates and high in those healthy 
 fats like olive oil, avocadoes, and salmon, ",383.654,6.926
"It's gonna take a little more preparation but 
 I know you can do it. ",390.584,3.556
"So eat up and enjoy, happy eating!",394.145,2.875
