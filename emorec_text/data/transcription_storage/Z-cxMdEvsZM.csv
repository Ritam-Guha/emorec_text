hi guys in this video we're gonna talk,0.0,3.06
about the difference between the,1.56,4.14
glycemic index and the glycemic load I,3.06,3.9
don't know if you ever heard about this,5.7,3.39
one probably this one but a lot of,6.96,3.57
people have not heard about this one but,9.09,3.509
there's two different factors here we,10.53,3.42
want to talk about especially when we're,12.599,2.881
dealing with glycemic which means the,13.95,5.1
sugar the glycemic index is how fast,15.48,6.03
that carbohydrate is digested or broken,19.05,4.59
down into the blood and then how much,21.51,4.679
power that has to raise the blood sugar,23.64,3.57
okay,26.189,3.031
and the speed at which it raises the,27.21,5.069
blood sugar whereas the glycemic load is,29.22,4.92
a little different it's the concentrated,32.279,4.111
amount of carbohydrate or the amount of,34.14,4.739
carbohydrate in the food so let me kind,36.39,4.62
of give you an example a carrot a raw,38.879,6.09
carrot is on the glycemic index 91 right,41.01,9.029
now 55 or less is low 56 to 69 is,44.969,8.641
moderate over 70 is high so coordinator,50.039,6.211
this scale but carrot would be high,53.61,7.07
because it's 91 okay the glycemic load,56.25,8.28
10 is low or 10 or less as low 10 to 20,60.68,7.119
is moderate greater than 20 is high so,64.53,5.879
if you look at a raw carrot 91 is pretty,67.799,4.89
high on the glycemic index but look at,70.409,5.301
the glycemic load it has a factor of 1,72.689,5.731
so what we're doing with the glycemic,75.71,4.81
load is deducting all the fiber it's,78.42,6.42
very fibrous right so this is not going,80.52,6.66
to influence your blood Sugar's nearly,84.84,6.029
as much as most other foods so let's,87.18,6.479
kind of go through candy bar okay a,90.869,5.61
typical candy bar is 68 so that's some,93.659,4.89
borderline and pretty high and that's a,96.479,5.731
half a candy bar glycemic load is 23 so,98.549,8.1
it's still high jellybeans 78 for a 1,102.21,7.29
ounce and mount of jellybeans glycemic,106.649,5.881
load is 22 again high there's not a lot,109.5,6.24
of fiber and jelly beans corn bread to,112.53,5.1
110 that's pretty high it's off the,115.74,3.089
charts,117.63,5.419
that's 160 gram piece of cornbread,118.829,9.49
glycemic index of 31 that's pretty high,123.049,10.341
grape nut okay that's 75 for a half of a,128.319,7.471
cup glycemic load is 31 is pretty high,133.39,4.739
you wouldn't think that Grape Nuts would,135.79,4.77
be that high as a cereal but it's pretty,138.129,2.791
high,140.56,4.38
potato 104 for a one large potato it's a,140.92,6.47
36 glycemic load that's pretty high,144.94,6.54
carrot 91 1 so that would be fine look,147.39,8.379
at corn 55 on the glycemic index but 62,151.48,7.709
on the glycemic load so this is the,155.769,5.041
worst thing you could possibly eat is,159.189,3.871
corn especially with related to your,160.81,4.08
blood sugars now what I want you to do,163.06,4.319
is I want you to type down the food that,164.89,4.98
you loved and ate as a child that was a,167.379,4.321
carbohydrate that wasn't too good for,169.87,4.22
you okay mine was combination between,171.7,5.849
Reese's peanut butter cups and Doritos,174.09,6.61
and pizza so what was yours I'm curious,177.549,5.03
all right talk to you later,180.7,4.349
hi guys listen I want to thank you so,182.579,4.69
much for your wonderful comments and I,185.049,3.541
want to ask you if you wouldn't mind,187.269,3.481
giving me your review on Google I put a,188.59,4.44
link down below I'd really appreciate it,190.75,5.419
and thank you in advance,193.03,3.139
