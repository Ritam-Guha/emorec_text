hey guys dr. Berg here in this video I,0.8,4.78
want to share with you two very very,3.36,4.89
important indexes the glycemic index,5.58,5.49
versus the insulin index now I'm just,8.25,4.259
going to pretend you've never even heard,11.07,3.12
about this one so just to keep it really,12.509,5.61
basic so the glycemic index is the scale,14.19,7.349
of foods that has influence over your,18.119,5.461
blood Sugar's within two to three hours,21.539,4.021
so there's certain foods like jelly,23.58,3.959
beans for example that you eat that you,25.56,5.16
trigger a lot of sugar response or a lot,27.539,5.101
of sugar in your blood it spikes up okay,30.72,4.14
and so that would be very high in the,32.64,4.829
scale but eating celery which is a,34.86,4.83
carbohydrate does not create that same,37.469,3.75
effect okay that would be low on the,39.69,3.689
scale and that's the glycemic index it,41.219,5.101
has to do with how fast carbohydrates or,43.379,5.07
sugars turn into or affect the blood,46.32,4.2
sugars okay and you have different,48.449,5.04
things to alter that like like a fiber,50.52,5.609
you know how much sugar that it's in,53.489,4.71
that carbohydrate that type of thing,56.129,5.421
then the insulin index is all those non,58.199,6.411
carbohydrate foods that affect insulin,61.55,6.28
okay so in other words when you eat,64.61,5.32
sugar you trigger insulin but there are,67.83,3.6
other foods that you eat that won't,69.93,5.07
necessarily they're not sugary foods but,71.43,6.84
they do trigger insulin okay so we're,75.0,5.28
going to explain that now here's the,78.27,3.75
thing insulin is the hormone that,80.28,4.049
regulates blood sugars it tends to lower,82.02,5.34
blood sugars in the presence of insulin,84.329,5.191
it's almost impossible to lose weight so,87.36,4.799
our goal is to have a low insulin low,89.52,4.95
sugar situation okay so check this out,92.159,4.411
so we have the glycemic index so really,94.47,4.55
high in the scale would be like just,96.57,5.64
plain sugar and then potato is very high,99.02,4.87
in the scale so this turns into sugar,102.21,5.67
really fast white bread is high whole,103.89,8.04
wheat bread is is just like a point less,107.88,7.05
it's not any it's almost equivalent so,111.93,4.17
if you're thinking you're eating whole,114.93,2.939
wheat bread and it's not turning into,116.1,3.39
sugar very fast it's actually very high,117.869,4.92
in the scale I think it's like 74 so,119.49,5.58
it's pretty high so now low on the list,122.789,4.5
and by the way I created links below so,125.07,4.35
you can see the whole scale on both of,127.289,3.841
these scales so that's why I didn't want,129.42,3.42
to write it out so we have lonely list,131.13,2.939
peanuts is very low,132.84,3.09
think it's like a it's like a 14,134.069,3.331
something like that so that's pretty low,135.93,5.52
and then hummus is a six so hummus would,137.4,7.05
be a very low glycemic thing to consume,141.45,5.819
good snack to eat okay so that's just,144.45,5.489
kind of that now let's take a look at,147.269,4.83
this insulin index and this might,149.939,5.371
surprise you very high in the list is,152.099,7.021
whey protein powder so whey protein is,155.31,6.959
very low fat very lean and that will,159.12,5.399
trigger insulin pretty high and then we,162.269,4.08
even have lean beef will also trigger,164.519,5.431
insulin okay now this is kind of goes,166.349,6.06
against what you've been told but that's,169.95,4.53
very high in the scale and then as we go,172.409,4.89
down with egg whites because it's less,174.48,6.239
fat is higher than the list egg yolks,177.299,5.97
are lower on the list it creates less of,180.719,4.261
an insulin response and then butter,183.269,7.291
bacon is even lower so my point is when,184.98,6.839
people are trying to lose weight what do,190.56,4.049
they do they avoid the fat and what do,191.819,5.31
they eat more protein but they have to,194.609,4.71
understand the scale right here fat,197.129,5.25
actually will buffer and lower the,199.319,5.79
insulin of effect so if you were going,202.379,4.771
to have some beef make sure it has some,205.109,4.681
fat in it because fat is one of the,207.15,6.089
things that is almost neutral when it,209.79,5.58
comes down to insulin and it doesn't,213.239,5.071
turn into sugar yes it has calories but,215.37,4.53
it doesn't create the effect on insulin,218.31,3.78
so it's great for diabetics so here's,219.9,4.589
the confusing part if protein triggers,222.09,4.709
insulin which is a fat making hormone,224.489,4.291
then why do people lose weight on,226.799,5.46
protein okay and that is because these,228.78,7.019
proteins also trigger the fat burning,232.259,6.991
hormones like glucagon and growth,235.799,6.15
hormone okay so that's why that can work,239.25,6.9
but the thing to remember is that we,241.949,5.671
want to keep in something low to,246.15,2.85
actually enhance the weight loss process,247.62,3.799
so if you were going to have protein,249.0,6.239
don't go so lean add some fat to it make,251.419,6.25
sure it's not so low fat if you're going,255.239,3.96
to have eggs have the whole eggs not,257.669,3.87
just the egg whites and I think you're,259.199,3.421
going to lose more weight and you're,261.539,2.13
actually going to be healthier doing,262.62,3.18
that okay so I just wanted to kind of,263.669,3.791
summarize what these,265.8,3.97
indexes are and I have the links below,267.46,4.019
so you can go ahead and study those and,269.77,3.959
go ahead and apply this information the,271.479,4.981
goal is to keep insulin low and it just,273.729,5.25
so happens that the only foods that,276.46,4.26
don't really trigger insulin that much,278.979,4.771
are the fats the exact foods that people,280.72,5.479
have been avoiding,283.75,2.449
