my name is christine marquette and i'm a,0.64,3.2
registered and licensed dietitian with,2.24,2.96
the austin regional clinic,3.84,2.559
and i'm going to talk to you about,5.2,3.2
losing weight taking vitamin b,6.399,5.12
complex now for most people if they are,8.4,5.68
getting enough b vitamins taking a b,11.519,3.361
complex,14.08,3.199
by itself won't actually help you lose,14.88,3.28
weight,17.279,3.76
however if you have been very deficient,18.16,4.56
in your fruits and vegetables,21.039,3.601
you haven't been eating a very healthy,22.72,3.52
diet say for example you've been eating,24.64,3.28
a lot of fast food or you've been eating,26.24,3.279
out a lot of restaurants,27.92,3.599
you may actually benefit from taking a,29.519,3.681
vitamin b complex so,31.519,3.681
short term it can help you with your,33.2,3.84
weight loss in the sense that,35.2,4.16
b vitamins are heavily involved in our,37.04,4.56
metabolic pathways they are used as,39.36,3.92
catalysts and help our,41.6,4.4
metabolism actually function properly so,43.28,4.64
if you're just getting back into healthy,46.0,2.559
eating,47.92,2.639
taking that b complex can kind of give,48.559,3.921
you a little head start can help boost,50.559,2.961
your,52.48,4.079
metabolism short term if you rely,53.52,5.28
on taking the b complex long term and,56.559,4.32
you don't ever improve your diet,58.8,4.16
the effects will not carry over they're,60.879,3.36
only going to last again,62.96,3.12
short term but you really need to make,64.239,4.001
sure that you are eating a healthy diet,66.08,4.56
that does include b vitamins naturally,68.24,3.52
from your foods,70.64,3.44
the main way that b vitamins work is,71.76,3.999
they work synergistically with,74.08,4.24
other compounds found in the foods so,75.759,4.881
just taking a b complex vitamin,78.32,4.32
you're not going to get the same exact,80.64,4.4
effect on your metabolism as you would,82.64,3.839
if you were actually eating the whole,85.04,2.16
foods,86.479,3.121
so the best thing to do as far as b,87.2,4.0
complex is make sure that you're getting,89.6,2.64
your b vitamins,91.2,3.919
from your foods don't rely strictly on,92.24,3.199
the,95.119,3.36
b complex multivitamin to get your b,95.439,7.201
vitamins because that's long-term,98.479,4.161
loss the other thing to keep in mind is,103.439,3.521
you're still going to need to include,105.52,3.04
some type of physical activity,106.96,3.199
it's very difficult to lose weight,108.56,3.44
without including the physical,110.159,4.161
activity as well as eating a healthy,112.0,4.0
diet so those are just some things to,114.32,2.479
keep in mind,116.0,2.719
when thinking about b complex for weight,116.799,4.64
loss,118.719,2.72
