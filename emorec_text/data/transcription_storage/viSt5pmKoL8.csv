I'm dr. John Peterson a member of the,9.22,4.77
boiling River clinic and today we're,12.31,3.559
going to talk about gastroparesis,13.99,4.47
gastroparesis is a chronic and,15.869,5.111
debilitating condition that affects the,18.46,4.55
stomach how the stomach accepts a meal,20.98,4.889
digests the meal and makes the meal,23.01,5.589
leave the stomach in a coordinated,25.869,4.261
fashion and people with guests or,28.599,3.991
phoresis have lost that ability to empty,30.13,4.71
from their stomach properly as a result,32.59,4.98
they have a lot of symptoms symptoms,34.84,5.07
that can be somewhat acute and others,37.57,4.23
that go on for years at a time,39.91,4.71
this can be nausea the feeling of,41.8,5.73
fullness after a meal abdominal pain,44.62,6.86
bloating gas belching regurgitating and,47.53,6.93
and at times very debilitating weight,51.48,5.26
loss the first step would be to take a,54.46,4.71
careful history to examine the patient,56.74,4.53
care plate and then consider an upper,59.17,4.62
endoscopy to examine the stomach and see,61.27,3.87
if there's something inherently wrong,63.79,3.66
with this at times we'll also do an,65.14,4.35
ultrasound or a cat scan to look at the,67.45,4.11
rest of the abdominal contents and make,69.49,3.83
sure that they're in good working order,71.56,4.08
if we find that the stomach looks good,73.32,4.51
and there's no inflammation there's no,75.64,4.53
ulceration or polyp or mass or,77.83,4.74
obstruction to the outflow of the,80.17,4.71
stomach that's when we take our next,82.57,4.409
step and that's the view what's called a,84.88,5.07
gastric emptying study that's a study,86.979,5.281
done by the nuclear medicine department,89.95,5.01
of radiology Center and once we have,92.26,4.71
that information if we find that the,94.96,4.32
stomach is significantly delayed and how,96.97,5.0
it works then we have the diagnosis of,99.28,6.269
gastroparesis this is a disorder that,101.97,5.829
commonly is seen in diabetics very,105.549,4.771
commonly probably 40 to 50 percent of,107.799,4.711
diabetics at some time in their lives,110.32,4.979
will have a component of a gastric,112.51,4.56
emptying disorder once we've confirmed,115.299,5.461
that they truly have gastroparesis be it,117.07,6.12
on a diabetic nature or a so-called,120.76,5.1
idiopathic nature we then try,123.19,5.67
medications we change their diets to see,125.86,4.89
if that'll have some benefit but in my,128.86,4.23
experience diet has that made a big,130.75,4.74
difference in the treatment of gastric,133.09,4.71
and now the option that we have is,135.49,5.25
gastric stimulation or gastric pacing,137.8,4.92
and we have just recently started,140.74,4.14
inserting these gastric pacemakers at,142.72,4.59
Baptist Hospital downtown with the,144.88,4.08
assistance of a very fine,147.31,4.23
laparoscopic surgeon who actually places,148.96,5.91
the pacemaker this is the so-called,151.54,6.33
antara the gastric stimulating device,154.87,6.03
this is its actual size and shape and,157.87,5.46
dimension you can see it's very thin for,160.9,5.49
a low profile weighs only a couple of,163.33,6.63
ounces this is inserted by the surgeon,166.39,6.21
at Baptist downtown into a small pouch,169.96,6.15
on the abdominal wall the leads that are,172.6,6.39
attached to the pacemaker are then,176.11,5.07
placed in the lower part of the stomach,178.99,6.03
itself and this computerized module,181.18,7.44
shows me exactly call that particular,185.02,6.78
generator is working how much time it,188.62,5.64
has taken off its battery supply how,191.8,4.79
much voltage is putting out with it each,194.26,5.49
stimulation to contract the stomach the,196.59,6.34
frequency the resistance all of these,199.75,5.13
things can be very carefully monitored,202.93,5.91
within this computerized module anywhere,204.88,6.81
from 50 to 75 percent of patients that,208.84,5.37
are paced will have improvement in their,211.69,4.71
overall symptoms their quality of life,214.21,5.07
will improve the frequency of the nausea,216.4,5.28
and vomiting spells will go down the,219.28,5.04
episodes requiring emergency room visits,221.68,4.74
and hospitalizations are drastically,224.32,5.7
reduced office visits the use of other,226.42,6.84
medications for pain and nausea reduced,230.02,5.61
we know this it's it's been a national,233.26,4.53
fact that this has shown to be a very,235.63,4.62
positive experience so we're very happy,237.79,5.39
to be part of that experience,240.25,2.93
you,252.36,2.06
