hello hi I want to talk to you today,0.53,4.96
about two vitamins that are important,3.0,5.49
for many women with PCOS that's vitamin,5.49,6.569
b12 and vitamin D now this information,8.49,7.019
is just for you to take with you and try,12.059,6.691
to fit in to your own health puzzle with,15.509,5.43
all supplements I recommend that you,18.75,3.72
take this information and present it to,20.939,3.121
your doctor or another healthcare,22.47,3.12
provider like a nutritionist or a,24.06,4.59
naturopath or do more research on your,25.59,5.88
own so you make sure that these choices,28.65,5.28
are right for you this is general,31.47,5.85
information to help you get started okay,33.93,7.53
so let's move on to vitamin b12 so why I,37.32,6.239
think that this is an important vitamin,41.46,4.079
for women with PCOS to be aware of it is,43.559,6.18
because long-term use of metformin the,45.539,6.121
drug that is commonly prescribed to them,49.739,4.771
with PCOS for insulin resistance it has,51.66,5.76
been shown again and again to cause low,54.51,5.639
vitamin b12 and people who use it long,57.42,6.84
term and some birth control pills also,60.149,7.83
cause low vitamin b12 particularly when,64.26,6.929
it's in combination with metformin so if,67.979,5.101
you are on metformin it's my,71.189,3.511
recommendation that you ask your doctor,73.08,4.2
to check you annually every year to see,74.7,7.11
if you have low b12 if you find it you,77.28,6.629
have low b12 or your physician things,81.81,3.21
that you should go ahead and start,83.909,2.431
supplementing with it since you're,85.02,4.889
taking metformin you can start usually,86.34,6.989
with just a hundred a hundred percent of,89.909,6.42
the daily recommended value one thing to,93.329,5.281
be aware of is that some people have,96.329,6.65
what's called the nth F R gene variant,98.61,6.84
it's a complicated thing that I'm not,102.979,4.661
I'm gonna get into right now it's just,105.45,5.029
to know that you may have trouble,107.64,6.479
breaking down vitamins in particular b12,110.479,5.831
is one of them if you have this gene,114.119,4.741
variant I happen to have it myself so,116.31,4.199
when I tested positive for that my,118.86,4.59
physician put me on a methylated b12,120.509,5.371
supplement that was appropriate for my,123.45,2.97
level,125.88,6.06
of b12 deficiency okay moving on to,126.42,8.34
vitamin D so vitamin D is a tricky one,131.94,4.65
because you can't get it from your diet,134.76,4.4
you have to get it from sun exposure and,136.59,5.13
most of us aren't getting a whole lot of,139.16,5.409
sun exposure maybe if you're unlike a,141.72,4.56
surf instructor you're getting some sun,144.569,7.5
exposure but anyway in some research 67,146.28,8.85
to 85 percent of women with PCOS were,152.069,6.931
found to be vitamin D deficient and,155.13,6.81
that's a problem because low vitamin D,159.0,5.06
is associated with fertility problems,161.94,4.97
cardiovascular disease her Sioux ISM,164.06,6.85
insulin resistance so if you are low in,166.91,7.48
vitamin D you could be aggravating all,170.91,4.98
of those problems that already come,174.39,4.2
along with having PCOS in fact some,175.89,4.71
studies have seen that women's with PCOS,178.59,5.07
see an improvement in their pursue ISM,180.6,5.969
infertility and cardiovascular factors,183.66,5.1
when they start taking a vitamin D,186.569,5.581
supplement now as far as I can tell in,188.76,5.34
the research there's no like one,192.15,7.339
particular vitamin D dosage for PCOS,194.1,8.79
right now a lot of people at experts are,199.489,4.84
kind of thinking that the daily,202.89,4.23
recommended value that we have currently,204.329,4.891
in the supplement industry isn't high,207.12,5.55
enough and so I'm reading just in my own,209.22,5.91
research that a good place to start is,212.67,6.12
"about 2,000 international units of",215.13,9.389
vitamin D particularly d3 and with all,218.79,7.86
vitamins you want to look for vitamins,224.519,4.291
from reputable sources that are either,226.65,6.45
NSF or GMP certified those are consumer,228.81,6.959
watchdogs for supplements so they test,233.1,4.949
the purity of a supplement to brands,235.769,4.411
that I recommend or Sarah logics which I,238.049,4.081
have a brand partnership I love their,240.18,4.44
brand and another brand that I've been,242.13,4.199
happy with it so available sometimes on,244.62,4.5
Amazon is pure encapsulations both of,246.329,4.151
those brands,249.12,3.61
have multiple levels of quality control,250.48,3.78
so that you can trust what you're,252.73,3.149
getting okay,254.26,4.74
so vitamin b12 and vitamin D it's,255.879,4.561
probably a good idea to get yourself,259.0,2.88
checked annually for your levels,260.44,3.03
especially if you're taking metformin,261.88,4.259
and birth control pills you might even,263.47,4.23
want to look into whether or not you,266.139,5.791
have the nth fr gene variant and you can,267.7,6.63
actually take a test on the 23andme comm,271.93,5.73
for that if you want to all right,274.33,5.67
go forth and choose your supplements,277.66,5.12
wisely ladies,280.0,2.78
