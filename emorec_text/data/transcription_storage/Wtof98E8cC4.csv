hi guys I'm back in this video we're,0.0,3.27
gonna discuss something called metabolic,1.86,5.209
syndrome it's called syndrome X okay and,3.27,6.21
we're going to talk about it it's really,7.069,4.931
kind of a combination of several things,9.48,4.5
like high blood pressure belly fat high,12.0,4.17
sugar cholesterol and in other countries,13.98,4.11
you can add a couple other things in,16.17,5.88
there as well okay so it's so,18.09,6.15
interesting because if you then look up,22.05,5.67
something called hyper insulin emia high,24.24,6.24
insulin okay they'll say that this,27.72,6.45
condition is associated with metabolic,30.48,5.759
syndrome and these symptoms okay but,34.17,4.86
really it causes it okay so I'm going to,36.239,5.611
show you something out of Wikipedia it,39.03,6.32
talks about high insulin,41.85,3.5
hyperinsulinemia okay this is associated,45.44,5.799
with hypertension I love that it's not,49.11,5.31
associated it's causing okay I'll,51.239,6.121
explain it surely obesity high,54.42,5.7
cholesterol and high blood glucose,57.36,5.1
alright this candies conditions,60.12,3.81
collectively are known as metabolic,62.46,5.13
syndrome this close association between,63.93,6.27
high insulin and conditions of metabolic,67.59,6.15
syndrome suggest or relate a common,70.2,7.59
mechanism of pathology this just,73.74,7.26
confuses people it doesn't suggest it it,77.79,6.57
says there they're unable to connect the,81.0,5.28
dots effectively they're kind of,84.36,3.6
switching and putting it all in this,86.28,5.549
confusion here high insulin has been,87.96,6.65
shown to play a role in obese,91.829,5.371
hypertension by increasing sodium,94.61,6.31
retention no that's that's insignificant,97.2,8.19
here we go linked to obesity since high,100.92,6.239
insulin and obesity are so closely,105.39,3.03
linked it's hard to determine whether,107.159,4.14
high insulin causes obesity or obesity,108.42,6.0
causes high insulin or both no it's not,111.299,5.161
it's pretty easy the fact is when you,114.42,5.97
actually get fat you you develop insulin,116.46,6.24
resistance which increases insulin but,120.39,5.009
you have to get fat initially it was the,122.7,5.479
high insulin that got you there okay so,125.399,7.081
obesity is characterized by an excess of,128.179,7.001
adipose tissue insulin increases the,132.48,4.56
synthesis of fatty acid from glucose,135.18,4.08
okay we knew that so basically insulin,137.04,7.169
turns glucose into fat and it inhibits,139.26,6.78
the breakdown of fat well good,144.209,4.471
right there thank you it's just,146.04,5.64
basically they just said that insulin,148.68,5.43
makes fat and it prevents the loss of,151.68,5.04
fat so it causes obesity they're just,154.11,4.17
they're actually telling you there's a,156.72,3.21
link you're giving you some confusion,158.28,2.789
then they actually tell you the truth,159.93,2.76
right underneath here it says high,161.069,8.721
insulin may lead to diabetes hello high,162.69,10.56
cholesterol hypertension because it,169.79,6.419
makes the arteries stiff coronary heart,173.25,7.65
disease cardiovascular disease and,176.209,8.53
weight gain okay we knew that treatment,180.9,4.14
okay,184.739,2.881
treatment is typically achieved via diet,185.04,5.039
and exercise although metformin may be,187.62,7.229
used to reduce insulin okay alright then,190.079,6.421
they go to say a low carbohydrate diet,194.849,4.371
is effective in reducing,196.5,5.25
hyperinsulinemia Wow,199.22,4.18
they're actually telling you what to do,201.75,4.109
lower the carbs thank you very much I've,203.4,5.07
been waiting for that a healthy diet,205.859,4.261
that is low in simple sugars and,208.47,3.48
processed carbohydrates and high in,210.12,4.41
fiber of course they're gonna get to the,211.95,5.069
grains shortly and vegetable protein,214.53,3.78
which by the way there's not a lot of,217.019,3.601
protein and vegetables there's some but,218.31,5.61
you comes with a lot of carb it's often,220.62,4.709
recommended this includes your placing,223.92,3.24
the white bread with whole-grain bread,225.329,4.141
here we go well it has near the same,227.16,4.199
glycemic index okay and I'll tell you,229.47,3.48
one thing when people eat whole grain,231.359,4.831
bread there they basically don't eat,232.95,4.47
whole grain bread they're eating whole,236.19,6.0
wheat bread okay so go to the grocery,237.42,7.02
store it's it's very very it's confusing,242.19,4.59
to people alright so then they say the,244.44,4.409
reducing intakes of food like starts or,246.78,4.859
potatoes increasing legumes which have a,248.849,6.351
bit of carbs in green vegetables,251.639,6.061
particularly soy so they're basically,255.2,4.36
want to emphasize soy at the very end,257.7,4.05
part I wonder why that is well if you,259.56,4.02
actually look up some data and so I'm,261.75,3.81
gonna put a link down below,263.58,4.92
soybean oil induces obesity diabetes,265.56,6.27
insulin resistance and fatty liver in,268.5,6.9
mice okay so we'll just have to test it,271.83,5.64
out if it's true in humans but the point,275.4,6.12
is that 98% of the soy out there is GM,277.47,7.35
oh so these people are not stupid I,281.52,5.43
think they just have to define it like,284.82,4.95
this because of the food manufacturing,286.95,4.32
companies and the chemical companies,289.77,4.05
behind them are really pulling the,291.27,4.619
strings okay so anyway I just wanted to,293.82,4.34
let you know that metabolic syndrome is,295.889,7.021
purely caused by high insulin all right,298.16,7.21
that's the cause this is the effect,302.91,4.53
these are the effects it's not,305.37,4.049
associated it's causing it all right,307.44,3.84
thanks for watching hey if you're,309.419,3.181
interested in finding out the underlying,311.28,3.96
cause of your body issues click the link,312.6,6.59
