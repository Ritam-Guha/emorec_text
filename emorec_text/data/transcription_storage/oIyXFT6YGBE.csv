"Hello, I'm Ken Mahaffey
from Stanford University",6.066,2.391
"and the Stanford Center
for Clinical Research.",8.457,1.974
"The Canvas Program was a
cardiovascular outcome trial",10.431,2.919
"to study the effects of
CANagliflozin compared to placebo",13.35,3.747
in patients with Type II Diabetes.,17.097,2.984
"The trial enrolled over 10,000
patients in 667 hospitals",20.081,4.381
in 30 countries around the world.,24.462,2.782
"The trial showed that
CANagliflozin compared with placebo",27.244,3.397
"reduced the hazard of cardiovascular
death and myosin stroke",30.641,3.445
by 14 percent with a P value of .02.,34.086,3.542
There were also important reductions,37.628,1.914
"in other cardiovascular outcomes,",39.542,1.981
"including hospitalization
for heart failure,",41.523,2.556
"cardiovascular death and heart failure,",44.079,2.149
and important renal outcomes as well.,46.228,2.715
"There was a two-fold
increase in amputations",48.943,2.786
associated with CANagliflozin.,51.729,2.155
"There's important
learnings from this trial.",53.884,2.575
"We've also shown that in
the secondary prevention,",56.459,2.412
in the primary prevention cohorts,58.871,1.833
"that there was no statistical
evidence of (mumbles)",60.704,3.08
"in the outcomes that
I've reviewed already.",63.784,3.728
There's more important information,67.512,2.089
"that we need to understand
about the amputation risk.",69.601,3.567
"Overall, in this program,
if you look at the number",73.168,2.754
"of events prevented in
1,000 patients treated",75.922,3.477
"for five years, there
was an overall reduction",79.399,2.77
"of 23 cardiovascular
deaths and myosin strokes,",82.169,4.226
"16 patient fewer hospitalizations,",86.395,3.195
"18 patients with improved renal outcomes,",89.59,3.797
"and 15 patients suffering amputations,",93.387,3.059
"of which five of those
were major amputations.",96.446,3.288
"More work is needed to understand
these important outcomes,",99.734,3.592
and those data will be obtained,103.326,1.731
"from the ongoing credence
and declared trials.",105.057,3.269
