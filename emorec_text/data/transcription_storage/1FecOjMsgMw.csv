we're often asked how does a our glucose,20.16,4.09
sensor measure the glucose,23.08,2.85
concentrations and someone with diabetes,24.25,3.96
and what I want to do is talk a little,25.93,4.23
bit about how that happens so the the,28.21,4.56
sensor itself is a small flexible probe,30.16,4.62
that's placed just underneath the skin,32.77,4.53
of a person with diabetes and it's in,34.78,4.529
the interstitial space so there's fluid,37.3,4.74
that surrounds the sensor and in that,39.309,4.551
fluid is the person's glucose,42.04,5.19
concentration and so the sensor hat is,43.86,5.229
an electro enzymatic sensor and what,47.23,3.87
that means is there's a chemistry,49.089,4.231
there's an enzyme glucose oxidase that's,51.1,5.31
on the sensor tip which reacts in the,53.32,5.399
presence of glucose and creates a signal,56.41,5.399
that we can measure there's actually a,58.719,5.311
number of layers to the sensing process,61.809,5.251
and the first step the glucose gets the,64.03,5.22
enzyme layer of glucose oxidase and,67.06,5.13
breaks down the glucose to create,69.25,6.39
hydrogen peroxide and other elements and,72.19,4.86
we're concerned about the hydrogen,75.64,3.899
peroxide that's created in that reaction,77.05,5.7
that hydrogen peroxide then diffuses to,79.539,6.841
a base metal layer of the sensor where,82.75,5.789
it's oxidized and what oxidation means,86.38,4.61
is that the it's broken down into,88.539,5.431
hydrogen oxygen and electrons which we,90.99,6.04
measure as a current so essentially what,93.97,5.129
we're doing is glucose in the person's,97.03,5.19
interstitial space is converted into,99.099,5.58
hydrogen peroxide at the enzyme layer,102.22,4.86
and then that hydrogen peroxide is,104.679,5.25
broken down at a base metal layer into,107.08,5.01
electrons which we measure as a current,109.929,4.14
so we're measuring our current which is,112.09,4.02
proportional to the person's glucose,114.069,4.97
concentration,116.11,2.929
so once the glucose sensor is placed,120.17,5.14
underneath the skin of the person it has,122.759,4.591
to be connected to the transmitter,125.31,4.619
device the mini link and that connection,127.35,5.279
process occurs and once that happens,129.929,5.191
what what is done is that the the sensor,132.629,5.071
is physically connected to the,135.12,5.22
transmitter inside this device are the,137.7,4.95
electronics that operates the sensor and,140.34,5.31
measures the signal created by detecting,142.65,4.83
glucose in the body and then there's a,145.65,4.8
transmitting element which transmits the,147.48,6.089
data every five minutes to our pump or,150.45,5.789
the guardian monitor it's in the pump or,153.569,4.591
guardian monitor that the calibration,156.239,4.291
process takes place the signals are,158.16,4.409
transmitted from here to that device but,160.53,3.989
once in the device that's where a meter,162.569,4.711
value is entered into the system,164.519,4.83
that performs the calibration processes,167.28,4.019
so the algorithm that converts the,169.349,4.23
signal into glucose is also housed,171.299,7.101
within the pump or the guardian monitor,173.579,4.821
so so once the sensor measures a signal,179.79,5.169
which is proportional to the glucose,183.34,3.629
concentration and again that's a current,184.959,4.411
we need to convert that signal into the,186.969,4.261
glucose concentration and the way we do,189.37,3.089
that is through a process called,191.23,4.56
calibration and there's an algorithm in,192.459,4.92
the pump system or in our Guardian,195.79,4.979
platform which allows the user to enter,197.379,5.94
a finger stick glucose reading into the,200.769,4.59
device and then that reading is,203.319,4.441
correlated to the actual signal that the,205.359,4.621
sensors measured and it converts,207.76,3.899
therefore it develops a factor that,209.98,3.869
converts the sensor signal to glucose,211.659,3.961
concentration from that point moving,213.849,3.991
forward so that as the sensor signals,215.62,5.1
change over time so does the calculated,217.84,4.59
glucose reading that the state that the,220.72,4.5
sensor is providing important safety,222.43,3.479
