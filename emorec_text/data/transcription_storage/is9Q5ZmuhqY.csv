hello this is dr. Ford Brewer with,0.03,5.749
state-of-the-art preventive medicine,2.87,5.29
available to all at least all with,5.779,5.021
access to YouTube today we're going to,8.16,4.41
talk about insulin resistance or,10.8,5.28
pre-diabetes and the oral medications,12.57,7.619
for diabetes and pre-diabetes the two,16.08,6.51
most popular are metformin and,20.189,7.58
pioglitazone most consider pilot ism,22.59,8.37
running a very poor second they consider,27.769,8.531
pioglitazone being a very difficult drug,30.96,7.41
to take we'll go over some of that in,36.3,4.68
the in the video first of all though,38.37,4.74
let's understand quickly what a cochrane,40.98,6.75
study is cochran CEO CHR II and II look,43.11,8.179
that up on Wikipedia in fact you'll find,47.73,6.54
that the Cochran organization does have,51.289,7.781
a partnership with Wikipedia and there,54.27,8.39
"are over 300,000 cochrane participants",59.07,7.229
what they do is look at a meta-analysis,62.66,8.65
a meta-analysis is an attempt to put,66.299,6.901
different studies on a similar topic,71.31,6.66
together so and it's almost like a,73.2,7.26
review of the literature on an exhibit,77.97,7.68
on an existing item so let's let's talk,80.46,7.62
about the Cochran studies in this area,85.65,4.859
in 2010 there was a there was a cochrane,88.08,4.2
study that showed something very,90.509,6.271
important about metformin risk metformin,92.28,9.299
was first discovered in the 1920s it was,96.78,9.119
available in the UK in 1960s it was not,101.579,7.131
made available in the u.s. until the,105.899,7.29
1990s midnight in fact 1995 part of the,108.71,6.61
reason for that was a fear associated,113.189,9.811
with lactic acidosis well in in 2010 the,115.32,9.81
Cochrane reviews indicated that when you,123.0,5.879
actually study metformin there was no,125.13,6.76
danger of lactic acidosis,128.879,5.53
it was associated with that class of,131.89,5.159
drugs that class is called biguanide,134.409,7.321
and other members of the biguanide drug,137.049,7.8
class did have lactic acidosis but not,141.73,7.679
metformin metformin has become the,144.849,7.56
frontline recommendation from,149.409,4.92
organizations like the American College,152.409,8.491
of endocrinology the WHI World Health,154.329,8.761
Organization did a lit review looking at,160.9,4.709
metformin and found it to be superior in,163.09,7.079
terms of cardiovascular outcomes impact,165.609,6.66
on cholesterol and triglycerides and,170.169,8.19
safety and side effects so what what,172.269,8.58
have we seen on the side of pioglitazone,178.359,6.38
and the other day I was in Diane's,180.849,6.211
pioglitazone tends to have better,184.739,3.84
results in terms of decreased,187.06,4.679
cardiovascular events and mortality this,188.579,5.681
is probably due to a positive impact on,191.739,6.27
cardiovascular inflammation that is the,194.26,6.8
finding of a recent cochrane study so,198.009,8.781
why would there be so little use of,201.06,8.41
Toyota's own and so much you submit,206.79,5.199
Foreman if the studies actually show,209.47,4.829
improved outcomes well here's why,211.989,4.59
there's also increased side effects,214.299,5.52
specifically edema that edema can even,216.579,6.211
lead to heart failure in certain,219.819,7.28
patients so again it's like the,222.79,7.08
situation with ACE inhibitors versus,227.099,5.681
ARBs ACE inhibitors do have improved,229.87,5.579
outcomes it's probably due to decreased,232.78,6.389
a cardiovascular inflammation but they,235.449,6.51
also have some negative impact and,239.169,7.47
safety issues compared to arcs same,241.959,6.9
thing here piyo does have improved,246.639,6.84
outcomes and decreased cardiovascular,248.859,8.97
events however there is increased safety,253.479,7.881
concerns due to edema,257.829,6.601
it's like rosanna rosanna Dennis said,261.36,3.59
for the,264.43,3.04
of us who remember it's still always,264.95,6.62
something thank you again,267.47,4.1
