okay one of the things will become,0.06,4.88
familiar with with your diabetic,2.7,7.35
diagnosis is the phrase hba1c it's not,4.94,7.199
very user friendly it is a medical term,10.05,7.02
it's to do with your hemoglobin in your,12.139,8.021
blood hemoglobin actually gives the red,17.07,5.31
color to red blood cells making your,20.16,4.5
blood red and one of the things that,22.38,5.01
happens in the body's metabolism is that,24.66,5.689
glucose actually sticks to hemoglobin,27.39,6.3
hemoglobin molecules usually live for,30.349,6.341
eight to 12 weeks so within that life,33.69,5.43
cycle they just give an average of the,36.69,6.17
whole two to three months of your,39.12,7.74
control you should be getting an HP a1c,42.86,7.12
reading every time you go to clinic and,46.86,4.44
type one diabetics really ought to be,49.98,3.03
going to clinic every three to four,51.3,3.89
months if possible,53.01,7.02
not all GPS do hba1c tests you might,55.19,6.43
actually actually end up being sent,60.03,4.349
either to a phlebotomist at your GPS or,61.62,4.89
going to the local hospital to get blood,64.379,5.31
drawn to get this done it's not usually,66.51,5.429
something that can get measured on a,69.689,4.381
certainly not on everyday meter where,71.939,4.051
there are some meters coming out that,74.07,4.68
are being designed for GPS surgery so,75.99,4.89
that they can do an hba1c on the spot,78.75,6.18
like any number it it needs to be taken,80.88,7.169
in context it's presented as a,84.93,6.149
percentage I mean for example my hba1c,88.049,5.851
is normally eight point two eight point,91.079,5.43
three percent it's not bad but it's not,93.9,7.579
great ideally it should be under six,96.509,7.831
normal diet well normal people who are,101.479,6.541
not diabetic it's usually under five now,104.34,6.63
because the diabetic is dealing with the,108.02,4.75
fact that their blood Sugar's can rise,110.97,4.56
quite a lot you know we can't literally,112.77,5.639
be expected to have the same reading as,115.53,5.97
a non diabetic in fact there's some,118.409,5.941
evidence to point that trying to achieve,121.5,6.599
that level actually reduces your chances,124.35,5.639
of living a really long time if you do,128.099,3.901
try and achieve that with diabetes it,129.989,2.991
means such too,132.0,6.26
control having said that the hba1c is,132.98,8.97
the best guide we have so what are the,138.26,5.16
things that's happening today is the HP,141.95,3.45
a1c test is actually being used to,143.42,5.399
diagnose diabetes it has been for a long,145.4,6.449
time but the fact is if people just do a,148.819,5.371
one-off blood test if your doctor does a,151.849,4.92
one-off blood test on you you might,154.19,5.189
actually be at that stage having a,156.769,6.03
normal or low blood sugar so you won't,159.379,7.741
show as having an abnormal blood sugar,162.799,7.41
reading but if you have blood tests done,167.12,4.56
over the space of a couple of weeks you,170.209,3.0
might find that there are peaks and,171.68,4.139
troughs that are not normal normal non,173.209,4.411
diabetics simply don't go out of this,175.819,4.321
range if the range is like this people,177.62,5.759
stay within it diabetics tend to do this,180.14,5.84
thing if you go over and above the norm,183.379,7.621
so the hba1c test is a it's a stake in,185.98,6.94
the ground it's literally something you,191.0,3.0
can hang your hat on,192.92,4.319
it that you can't judge all your,194.0,5.31
diabetic control from it because of the,197.239,4.921
fact it's an average if your hba1c is,199.31,5.94
6.5 it might actually be hiding quite,202.16,5.04
badly but controlled diabetes we you,205.25,3.15
might be spending an awful lot of time,207.2,3.569
having hypos which wouldn't be very,208.4,5.48
desirable in terms of quality of life,210.769,6.53
having said that it's very important,213.88,7.509
because it's the clearest indicator we,217.299,8.53
have as to your long-term ability to,221.389,6.331
live with diabetes and not end up with,225.829,3.75
what they call diabetic complications,227.72,4.71
which is damage to the body there was a,229.579,5.52
test called the DC CT it was done in,232.43,4.739
America it wasn't a test as a study and,235.099,5.631
it went on for ten years between 1983 to,237.169,6.781
1993 and they took more than a thousand,240.73,5.259
people with diabetes you had only had it,243.95,4.2
between one and fifteen years and who,245.989,4.47
had no signs of either nerve damage or,248.15,5.339
eye damage or kidney damage and they put,250.459,6.541
them into two groups one had normal,253.489,9.721
control as per the time frame that they,257.0,6.93
were history,263.21,1.63
how it was,263.93,2.769
looked at being controlled back then,264.84,6.03
which is 25 years ago at versus what,266.699,6.091
they called tight control which is,270.87,4.65
really its carb counting multiple blood,272.79,5.64
testing multiple injections and they,275.52,6.72
were able to show that the multiple you,278.43,7.049
know that the tight control helps stave,282.24,5.82
off any complications it helped to have,285.479,6.061
much better hba1c results and good age,288.06,5.85
be able to see results lead to a much,291.54,4.08
better long-term prognosis,293.91,6.33
so the hba1c is an important number and,295.62,6.42
you should be getting it looked at at,300.24,4.26
least every three to six months and if,302.04,3.99
the numbers always good and there's no,304.5,4.26
need to worry but if it's always bad,306.03,5.34
then you know you need to keep keep,308.76,4.5
trying with new medications and new,311.37,3.87
tools until you can get the balance,313.26,4.62
right in your life so just two points,315.24,5.34
about using the hba1c test to diagnose,317.88,6.3
diabetes if it comes up at as higher,320.58,7.41
than or greater than 6.5 percent you're,324.18,5.85
pretty much defined as having diabetes,327.99,5.82
if it comes up between six and six point,330.03,5.759
five you're probably going to get,333.81,4.38
diagnosed with pre-diabetes or what's,335.789,4.201
for a while was called at one point five,338.19,4.979
diabetes as opposed to type one or type,339.99,7.17
two but if your reading is less than six,343.169,6.151
percent then you're not considered to be,347.16,5.93
either pre-diabetic or diabetic,349.32,3.77
