pre and post meal blood glucose testing,0.56,4.48
is a way of being able to judge the,3.439,3.36
effect of meals on your blood sugar,5.04,3.28
levels,6.799,3.92
the benefits of pre and post meal blood,8.32,4.72
glucose testing include,10.719,4.08
helping you to see how certain foods,13.04,4.159
affect your blood sugar levels,14.799,4.32
showing you how long certain foods take,17.199,4.16
to affect your blood sugar levels and if,19.119,3.761
you're on insulin,21.359,4.881
helping you to judge your insulin doses,22.88,6.799
pre and post meal testing involves,26.24,5.52
performing a blood glucose test before,29.679,3.521
starting a meal,31.76,3.36
performing another test two hours after,33.2,3.44
starting the meal,35.12,3.599
performing a third test four hours after,36.64,3.599
eating,38.719,3.441
in most cases you should find that blood,40.239,4.0
glucose results are higher after two,42.16,3.68
hours than they were before eating the,44.239,3.681
meal you should be looking to see how,45.84,4.0
much your blood glucose rises after,47.92,2.88
eating,49.84,3.76
take the following examples,50.8,5.52
example one,53.6,5.84
you test before meal a and get a 5.0,56.32,5.44
millimoles per liter reading,59.44,4.32
you test two hours after the meal and,61.76,5.28
get a 9.0 millimoles per liter reading,63.76,5.6
so meal a has caused a rise of four,67.04,5.84
millimoles per liter,69.36,5.759
example 2,72.88,5.279
you test before meal b and get a 7.0,75.119,5.04
millimoles per liter reading,78.159,4.401
you test 2 hours after the meal and get,80.159,5.6
a 10.0 millimoles per liter reading,82.56,5.68
so we see that meal b raises blood sugar,85.759,6.161
by three millimoles per liter,88.24,3.68
if we had just done a post meal reading,93.2,3.36
we might have thought that meal a was,95.04,4.399
the better option but because meal b has,96.56,4.72
raised our blood sugar levels by a lower,99.439,4.0
amount meal b does seem to be the better,101.28,3.839
option for us,103.439,3.921
your 4-hour reading should ideally show,105.119,4.081
that your blood glucose levels have,107.36,3.6
returned to the target range for,109.2,4.16
pre-meal readings which is between four,110.96,4.479
and seven millimoles per liter for most,113.36,3.84
adults with diabetes,115.439,3.841
these meals are just examples,117.2,3.919
if you perform before and after meal,119.28,3.68
readings you can see how your own blood,121.119,3.841
glucose levels are affected by different,122.96,4.0
meals,124.96,3.68
when reviewing your blood glucose,126.96,3.439
results it helps to know what your,128.64,3.52
target results are,130.399,4.881
the target levels recommended by nice,132.16,5.28
vary slightly depending on your diabetes,135.28,3.679
type,137.44,3.76
for people with type 2 diabetes you,138.959,4.161
should aim for a level of between 4 and,141.2,4.48
7 millimoles per liter before meals and,143.12,4.96
under 8.5 millimoles per liter after,145.68,3.6
meals,148.08,3.12
people with type 1 diabetes should aim,149.28,3.76
for a level of between 4 and 7,151.2,4.16
millimoles per liter before meals and,153.04,5.919
under 9 millimoles per liter after meals,155.36,5.599
children with type 1 diabetes should aim,158.959,3.521
for a level of between 4 and 8,160.959,3.92
millimoles per liter before meals and,162.48,4.24
under 10 millimoles per liter after,164.879,3.36
meals,166.72,3.68
note that target ranges may vary from,168.239,4.801
individual,170.4,2.64
people with higher susceptibility to,174.239,4.64
hypos for example maybe advise different,176.0,7.08
target levels to the above guidelines,178.879,4.201
