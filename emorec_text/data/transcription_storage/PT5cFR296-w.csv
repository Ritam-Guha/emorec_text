"I'm Niraj Desai, I'm a transplant surgeon
here at Johns Hopkins, in the",12.441,3.339
"department of surgery, and I'm the
director",15.78,2.067
"of the kidney and pancreas transplant
program.",17.847,2.232
[MUSIC],20.079,4.065
"The pancreas transplant operation is done
through an abdominal mid-line incision.",24.144,6.334
"And that is an up and down incision on the
abdomen.",30.478,3.892
"We connect the artery and the vein that
both supply the",34.37,4.03
"blood to the pancreas and return the blood
back to the body.",38.4,3.9
"And then once we allow the blood flow into
the",42.3,2.6
"pancreas, we have to connect a small piece
of intestine",44.9,3.78
"that comes with the pancreas organ to the
patient's intestine",48.68,5.31
"to allow drainage of the excrement
material into the patients body.",53.99,6.59
"Previously, people would connect that to
the bladder, but we really don't do that",60.58,5.03
"procedure anymore, because the patients
tolerate it",65.61,2.82
"being connected to the intestines much
better.",68.43,2.88
"It, it's not associated with long-term",71.31,2.628
"complications like connecting it to the
bladders.",73.938,3.227
[MUSIC],77.165,3.817
"The combined kidney and pancreas
transplant operation",80.982,3.672
"is done through an abdominal mid line
incision",84.654,2.808
"and we, and that is an incision that runs
up and down on the abdomen.",87.462,4.138
And we place the kidney and the pancreas,91.6,2.244
"in, almost like two different operations
in the abdomen.",93.844,4.106
"Typically, we'll put the kidney in first,
allow the blood",97.95,3.49
"flow back into the kidney and let it start
working.",101.44,3.37
"And then in a separate location, but",104.81,2.73
"through the same incision put the pancreas
in.",107.54,2.93
"So the patient wakes up having had two
operations done on the",110.47,3.81
"inside, but through one incision and",114.28,2.11
"both organs are hopefully functioning
immediately.",116.39,3.61
They're making urine.,120.0,1.26
"The creatinine is coming down, reflecting
kidney function and",121.26,3.564
"the pancreas is making insulin and the
glucoses become normal.",124.824,3.61
[MUSIC],128.434,4.911
"Pancreas after kidney, transplant
operations, would",133.345,3.2
"be two separate operations, done through
two",136.545,2.496
"different incisions, two different
hospital stays and,",139.041,3.2
"of course, two, independent recoveries as
well.",142.241,2.919
[MUSIC],145.16,4.569
"With the pancreas transplant alone, the
quality of",149.729,3.388
"life is primarily focused upon normalizing
someone's glucose control.",153.117,4.876
"Patients who are typically undergoing a
pancreas-alone transplant have a very",157.993,5.032
difficult quality of life from extreme,163.025,2.442
"difficulties in controlling their blood
sugars.",165.467,3.333
"So they'll run from being very low and
having hypoglycemia, which can lead to,",168.8,7.31
"passing out, or seizures, having to call
for emergency help, problems like that.",176.11,6.48
"And then, alternatively, swings toward the
high end, where they end up with very",182.59,4.39
"high glucoses, and have to end up",186.98,1.81
"being hospitalized for control of their
diabetes.",188.79,2.34
"When the pancreas is successful, all of
their glucoses should become normal, and",192.17,5.12
"they avoid both the lows and the highs and
have excellent glucose control.",197.29,4.9
"Long term the advantage of that is that
complications from diabetes, what",203.46,5.544
"we refer to as secondary complications are
either reversed or minimized.",209.004,5.611
[MUSIC],214.615,4.231
"Quality of life after the combined
procedure is fantastic.",218.846,4.198
"These individuals come in with two
problems, kidney",223.044,3.555
"failure or most of the time on dialysis
and",226.599,2.765
a very long period of time of having been,229.364,2.607
"diabetic, taking insulin, having",231.971,2.449
"difficulties with controlling their
glucoses.",234.42,3.39
"And after the single operation, both of",237.81,2.38
"those problems are fixed, so they feel
fantastic.",240.19,3.4
"They're no longer on dialysis or impending
about to go on.",243.59,3.85
"They no longer have to take insulin and
having",247.44,2.22
"swings in their blood sugars and having
normal control.",249.66,3.03
"So we fix the kidney problem, we fix their
diabetes, and",252.69,2.976
"when this works well it is an outstanding
result for the individual.",255.666,3.607
[MUSIC],259.273,5.125
"So individuals that receive a pancreas
transplant can expect the",264.398,3.795
"organ to often last for 10 years or more,
on average.",268.193,3.317
It is a very durable therapy.,271.51,2.967
"It is able to function for many, many
years when the",274.477,3.29
"patient is compliant and especially when
early rejection episodes are avoided.",277.767,4.942
[MUSIC],282.709,4.842
"Even from a deceased donor, the combined
operation it is probably mostly a function",287.551,7.125
"of us being able to monitor the kidney, to
pick up on problems related to rejection.",294.676,6.777
"It's hard to track rejection of the
pancreas,",301.453,2.24
"whereas it's easier to track rejection of
the kidney.",303.693,3.167
"So if you have both organs in, you can
follow the kidney quite easily and know",306.86,3.712
"that there's a trouble and increase the
immunosuppression",310.572,2.958
"if there's rejection, and treat both, in
both organs.",313.53,2.973
"It tends to correlate, so if you're having
rejection in the kidney, you're typically",316.503,4.125
"having rejection in the pancreas, and
that's",320.628,2.2
at least an 80% correlation for those two.,322.828,2.26
[MUSIC],325.088,4.894
"So initially after the operation is done,
patients spend at least a",329.982,3.705
"week in the hospital and often a couple of
weeks in the hospital.",333.687,3.521
"Once someone goes home, they are getting
labs drawn",337.208,4.004
"twice a week usually close to home and
coming",341.212,3.367
"back for outpatient visits on a weekly
basis and",344.579,3.64
"then every other week and then once a
month.",348.219,3.448
"And for the first couple of months,
they're",351.667,2.812
"back here for out patient visits fairly
frequently.",354.479,3.343
"But once times goes on, they're able to
just follow up every three months, but",357.822,5.396
"still getting labs twice a week, then once",363.218,2.736
"a week, every other week, and then
monthly.",365.954,3.03
[MUSIC],368.984,3.371
"So long term follow up which I would say
is after the first year, patients are",372.355,4.8
seen once every three months in a doctor's,377.155,2.7
"office appointment and get labs drawn once
a month.",379.855,3.394
[MUSIC],383.249,6.169
"Patients come to Hopkins to look into a
pancreas transplant for several reasons.",389.418,5.201
"One, there's a big team of people here",394.619,1.98
"that are dedicated to taking care of
transplant patients.",396.599,3.601
"The expertise that these individuals bring
is fantastic for",400.2,3.621
"this patient population, and this includes
surgeons, medical physicians,",403.821,5.041
"nurse coordinators, nurse practitioners,
everyone together has had a",408.862,4.402
"lot of experience taking care of pancreas
transplant patients.",413.264,3.935
"And as a result that collective experience
is great for",417.199,2.99
"helping someone through the operative
procedure, and the post-operative recover.",420.189,4.857
"The second reason that patients come to
Hopkins, to look into a pancreas",425.046,4.27
"transplant is the experience that we have
with taking care of sensitized patients.",429.316,5.3
"These are individuals that have antibody
in their",434.616,2.772
"bloodstream, or often difficult to
transplant, and the",437.388,3.234
"experience that has been gained in both
the",440.622,2.376
"kidney and pancreas transplant populations
that have antibody that",442.998,4.092
"makes transplantation difficult, draws
individuals here looking for",447.09,4.29
"a chance at transplant when they haven't
been",451.38,2.574
"able to get that opportunity elsewhere,
because of",453.954,2.904
"these sensitization events they have
undergone in the past.",456.858,3.438
