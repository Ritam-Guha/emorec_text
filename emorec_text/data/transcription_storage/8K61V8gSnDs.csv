so thought a really quick video on the,3.36,4.439
acute management of hypoglycemia but,5.339,4.8
that's a sugar of less than 3.5 I can,7.799,3.63
presented number different ways to cover,10.139,3.031
in a different video but the first thing,11.429,3.481
to think about in a case like this is is,13.17,3.57
the person conscious can they swallow,14.91,4.02
always the person unconscious and,16.74,4.41
therefore can't swallow if someone can't,18.93,4.23
swallow they're conscious you're looking,21.15,3.6
at around 10 to 20 grams of a,23.16,4.199
fast-acting carbohydrate into the pretty,24.75,4.5
fast to boost that sugar level usually,27.359,3.211
prefer liquid but there's lots of,29.25,2.46
different ways you can do this things,30.57,3.419
like 3 to 6 glucose tablets things like,31.71,5.34
90 to 100 mils 180 ml story of a fizzy,33.989,4.801
drink you can use things like certain,37.05,3.57
sweets you can use things like add extra,38.79,3.48
jello you can prescribe the base you're,40.62,3.84
trying to bump it up with 10 to 20 grams,42.27,4.41
of the fast-acting carbohydrate,44.46,4.41
now if they're unconscious then you're,46.68,4.649
thinking of I am glucagon and the dose,48.87,4.079
is normally one milligram for most,51.329,3.451
people but it's less than that so no,52.949,3.63
point 5 milligrams if they're under 8,54.78,3.81
years old or if they're under 25,56.579,4.081
kilograms in weight but usually one,58.59,5.07
milligram I am glucagon if they can't,60.66,4.92
swallow if they're unconscious so the,63.66,3.389
first day to work on is kindest person,65.58,3.51
swallow why are they conscious or can,67.049,4.081
they not swallow another unconscious and,69.09,3.569
