"- Hi. I'm Bob Eckel at the
University of Colorado,",5.602,2.114
"Anschutz Medical Campus in
Aurora just east of Denver,",7.716,3.564
and I'm here to report on a publication,11.28,3.204
"just released by the
American Heart Association",14.484,2.543
that deals with cardiovascular disease,17.027,2.6
"in patients with type 1 diabetes,",19.627,2.45
"I was the senior author
on a multi-authored paper",22.077,2.763
"that Sarah de Ferranti from
the Boston Children's Hospital",24.84,4.234
assumed the role of the first author.,29.074,2.233
The purpose of this manuscript really is,31.307,2.601
to bring to light the fact that,33.908,2.055
"cardiovascular disease in
patients with type 1 diabetes",35.963,2.728
"may not be the same entity
that it is in type 2 diabetes.",38.691,4.296
"Now I should point out, too,",42.987,1.23
"the American Diabetes Association
teamed up with the AHA",44.217,2.345
"on this document, so it's been reviewed",46.562,1.741
by both organizations.,48.303,2.033
But I think a couple of the key points,50.336,1.764
"that we want to bring that
we want to bring forth",52.1,0.9
on this manuscript is:,53.0,2.31
"number one,
Are their risk factors",55.31,1.585
"the same?
And they may not be.",56.895,2.52
"Other than duration of diabetes,",59.415,2.019
"and perhaps hypertension,",61.434,2.114
"and perhaps glucose control,
that could be debated,",63.548,3.718
"the risk factors for atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease",67.266,2.74
and type 1 are quite a bit different.,70.006,1.822
The lipids are very different.,71.828,1.672
Patients with type 1 diabetes,73.5,1.544
"have higher levels of HDL cholesterol,",75.044,2.587
"but yet, they have a burden
of cardiovascular disease,",77.631,2.996
particularly the atherosclerotic form.,80.627,1.996
Why is that?,82.623,1.033
Is the HDL not working correctly?,83.656,2.566
"Or, in fact, is the high HDL, in fact,",86.222,2.763
"dysfunctional, in fact, causing harm?",88.985,2.543
I don't think we have an answer to that.,91.528,2.194
What are the other risk factors,93.722,1.394
"that relate the atherosclerotic
cardiovascular disease",95.116,1.996
and type 1 diabetes?,97.112,1.057
This manuscript really reviews,98.169,1.614
all the potential risk factors,99.783,1.521
"and brings you up to date on that,",101.304,2.078
but really reveals the fact that,103.382,1.439
we don't know a lot about the,104.821,1.103
"atherosclerotic disease in
patients with type 1 diabetes.",105.924,3.681
"Another area is the plaque.
Is the plaque the same?",109.605,2.821
Is it so lipid laden?,112.426,2.101
"And not only is HDL higher
in type 1 diabetic patients,",114.527,3.402
"but actually LDL
cholesterols are the same,",117.929,1.916
or lower.,119.845,0.94
Triglycerides are almost never abnormal,120.785,2.124
"unless control is pitifully,
poorly controlled.",122.909,2.973
"I think we've got these issues
related to the plaque itself.",125.882,2.948
Maybe the plaque is less lipid laden.,128.83,2.973
I think one hypothesis is the plaque,131.803,2.101
"is more calcified, more fibrotic,",133.904,1.951
"and may actually be more
stable in patients with type 1.",135.855,3.042
Is the disease the same?,138.897,2.136
"Another area is the acute
coronary syndrome setting.",141.033,3.878
When the late George Eisenbarth and I,144.911,1.66
"did an editorial actually
in translational science",146.571,3.703
"before George left us,
unfortunately prematurely,",150.274,3.542
"we brought up the fact that
the acute coronary syndrome",153.816,2.255
"has never actually been
studied in type 1 patients.",156.071,3.622
Everything that links diabetes to,159.693,1.855
cardiovascular disease is type 2.,161.548,2.38
"But, in fact, what the group at the Joslin",163.928,1.729
has identified is that after a,165.657,1.859
"myocardial infarction on
a mass model in type 1,",167.516,3.017
"there is a antibody mediated
myocarditis developed.",170.533,3.832
"But, when George and I wrote the editorial",174.365,2.044
"we couldn't find any evidence
the acute coronoary syndrome",176.409,2.821
has actually been studied well,179.23,1.834
in patients with type 1 diabetes.,181.064,1.753
"In fact, is there an
antibody mediated myocarditis",182.817,3.645
that results in a greater likelihood,186.462,1.696
"of congestive heart failure
and the acute coronary syndrome",188.158,2.542
"in patients with type 1?
We don't know.",190.7,2.996
"Finally, interventions in
type 1 just haven't ensued.",193.696,3.599
What about statin trials in type 1?,197.295,2.113
When did we start a type 1 child,199.408,1.962
with type 1 diabetes on a statin?,201.37,2.357
What about anti-hypertensive therapy,203.727,2.067
and cardiovascular disease outcomes,205.794,1.938
in patients with type 1?,207.732,1.556
I think what the manuscript does,209.288,1.498
"is really reveal these
absent areas of knowledge",210.786,3.97
about type 1 diabetes and how it relates,214.756,2.078
"to coronary heart disease, and
peripheral vascular disease,",216.834,2.532
"and stroke in patients
with type 1 diabetes.",219.366,3.123
"In fact, I think what
we've learned from this",222.489,1.926
"is that there's so many
unanswered questions",224.415,2.38
"that when I was at a meeting
at the NIDDK in the last year,",226.795,4.83
"ultimately I brought to
the attention to NIDDK",231.625,2.822
"that this area really needs more science,",234.447,2.29
"and, in fact, what's
happened subsequent to that",236.737,3.015
"is that NHOBI and NIDDK are
sponsoring a joint symposium,",239.752,4.761
"a workshop, on coronary
disease and type 1 diabetes",244.513,3.668
that's going to take place this October.,248.181,2.636
We're excited about the opportunity,250.817,1.683
to bring scientists from around the world,252.5,1.951
"together on a topic that's
been poorly studied,",254.451,2.74
and I think this manuscript in circulation,257.191,3.204
really highlights the need for additional,260.395,2.543
"science and medicine in
this particular area.",262.938,3.75
