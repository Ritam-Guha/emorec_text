moms with diabetes whether it be type 1,0.29,5.23
type 2 or gestational diabetes are more,3.12,5.1
likely to cook large babies and it's,5.52,4.56

have a large amount of blood sugar,12.03,4.05
circulating and this is getting to the,14.009,4.411
baby as well so they can grow extra,16.08,4.14
large from having that extra sugar and,18.42,4.23
it causes complications after delivery,20.22,5.13
because their body is normal they are,22.65,5.28
producing insulin which is like a key,25.35,4.53
that unlocks cells to put the blood,27.93,4.98
sugar into the cell and so their body's,29.88,5.19
response to this large amount of sugar,32.91,5.13
is to produce a lot of insulin and this,35.07,4.62
is great and what their body should do,38.04,3.06
while they're inside of you but once,39.69,3.869
they're born and not getting all of that,41.1,5.76
blood all of that sugar they still have,43.559,5.221
a high level of insulin to compensate,46.86,3.75
for that and it causes their blood sugar,48.78,4.29
to rapidly drop and a lot of babies born,50.61,4.08
to mothers with diabetes struggle,53.07,3.0

be in tune with this and be watching,60.27,3.889
your newborn for signs of complications,62.19,5.28
but as for how big your baby's likely to,64.159,6.401
be who knows it's hard to say and the,67.47,4.8
