my name is Hillary goldrick and I have a,0.0,4.35
brother with hemophilia type B and I'm a,2.25,4.92
carrier of hemophilia type be there is a,4.35,4.74
lot of special attention for my brother,7.17,6.12
um I mean I guess it was not hard or,9.09,6.179
anything it was easy but like one of,13.29,3.749
your brothers would play basketball all,15.269,4.651
the time and the other brother would not,17.039,5.49
be able to participate quite as much,19.92,5.34
maybe I mean for the most part it was,22.529,5.701
like any other brother um yeah I,25.26,5.88
remember one year we were going to like,28.23,5.25
a birthday dinner or something like that,31.14,4.68
and he like leaned on the side of the,33.48,4.98
car and there was like a broken antenna,35.82,5.399
and he cut his arm and instead of like,38.46,4.38
just being able to put a bandaid on it,41.219,5.281
and leave it was like a big deal and we,42.84,5.52
had to go to the emergency room and get,46.5,4.89
stitches and basically we missed the,48.36,5.64
entire dinner because he cut his arm on,51.39,5.52
a piece of metal which like usually,54.0,5.37
would have been like a band-aid fix I,56.91,5.699
mean it doesn't make me really feel any,59.37,5.67
different like yeah I want to have kids,62.609,5.76
and I don't care if it's a girl or a boy,65.04,7.079
and Elliot said before that if I do have,68.369,5.551
a boy he wants them to have hemophilia,72.119,5.761
type B so that they will have someone,73.92,7.199
like him to kind of guide them along so,77.88,5.75
that's cool i come down with that i I,81.119,6.121
know it's not like necessarily something,83.63,6.61
at kid wishes upon themselves but i,87.24,5.4
think this community has been really,90.24,4.71
good for him I mean it's affected his,92.64,5.7
job and the people that he knows and it,94.95,6.48
hasn't dictated his life but you know,98.34,5.34
it's made him try maybe a little bit,101.43,4.88
more to like a go and mountain bike or,103.68,5.31
you know meet some people in this,106.31,5.14
community and network with them I don't,108.99,3.78
know what I think it's been a positive,111.45,4.26
influence on his life overall so what I,112.77,4.559
like to say about growing up with my,115.71,3.93
brothers a lot of people will assume you,117.329,4.711
know like your brother is has hemophilia,119.64,4.65
they're fragile or whatever that's not,122.04,4.35
the case at all like anyone with,124.29,4.139
hemophilia can do anything that anyone,126.39,4.619
else does like he is one of those active,128.429,4.301
fit people that I know,131.009,5.34
and I think people assume that because,132.73,7.08
you have this disease like you you have,136.349,4.901
to stay home all the time I could be a,139.81,3.209
bubble boy or something that's not the,141.25,3.33
case like you can do whatever you want,143.019,5.75
you just have to make it work for you,144.58,4.189
