hi i'm cherylin from Duke Clinical,0.0,5.04
Research Institute and shanghaiing,2.61,5.249
hospital I would like to tell you our,5.04,5.269
study about the use of beta blocker,7.859,6.57
statin and diuretic increase the risk of,10.309,8.671
new-onset diabetes in patient with itt,14.429,7.381
it's a real analysis of data from,18.98,5.41
navigator trial the study question is,21.81,5.69
what is the risk of new-onset diabetes,24.39,6.69
when using beta blocker diuretic and,27.5,7.84
Staten impatient with igt and any other,31.08,6.69
cardiovascular risk factors the summer,35.34,6.39
answer is a mount patient with itt and,37.77,7.26
cardiovascular risk factors by using,41.73,6.66
cereals glucose measurement the use of,45.03,5.64
diuretic and Staten are associated with,48.39,5.28
increased risk of diabetes where is the,50.67,5.659
effect a beta blocker is nonsignificant,53.67,5.43
many recent study have showed that,56.329,5.351
long-term use of diuretic beta blocker,59.1,5.73
and Staten increase the fasting glucose,61.68,6.06
level and those concerns have led us fda,64.83,5.93
to initiate a statin label change in,67.74,7.199
2012 however limited study has examined,70.76,7.33
Association among patient with igt and,74.939,6.601
cardiovascular risk factors therefore we,78.09,5.91
initiate our study by using data from,81.54,4.829

are defined as new onset diabetes,133.86,7.38
specifically as falling defined the,138.29,5.41
frequency of measurement is every six,141.24,4.02
months for the first two three years,143.7,4.98
then annually afterward we examine the,145.26,6.69
initiation of treatment a progression to,148.68,6.9
diabetes along the whole full of time we,151.95,6.18
use marginal structure model which,155.58,5.52
enable us to take into account time,158.13,5.37

with loss patient who never initiate any,206.88,4.77

our study show that the use of diuretic,211.65,5.73

diabetes with the hazard ratio of one,217.38,5.79
point two three four diuretic and has,220.17,7.41
ritual of 1.32 for statin where is the,223.17,6.36
effect of beta blocker is now,227.58,5.1
significant we have robust data for our,229.53,6.019
study and there are some limitations,232.68,6.21
first is a post-hoc study from navigator,235.549,5.321
trial which is not powered to examine,238.89,5.03
such association at the first place,240.87,6.36
second we did not examine the dose,243.92,5.319
response for those medication and,247.23,5.97
progression to diabetes third we have,249.239,6.391
limited population in beta blocker group,253.2,5.31
which is underpowered to examine such,255.63,5.75
association among those populations and,258.51,5.73
family we did not examine the,261.38,4.87
cardiovascular outcomes,264.24,4.62
using those medication among i gt,266.25,5.49
patient the strength of our study is,268.86,6.09
that first it's a largest study of this,271.74,6.0
kind to date and we use a standard,274.95,5.52
method to diagnose diabetes by using,277.74,5.73
serious glucose measurement the marginal,280.47,5.45

cardiovascular risk factors to conclude,297.72,7.44
in high-risk patient with itt their use,300.93,6.54
of diuretic and Staten are associated,305.16,4.82

civilians of glucose level should be,322.88,4.93
considered further study are orientated,325.169,4.981
to examining the cardiovascular outcomes,327.81,5.73
of using those medication among itt,330.15,6.15
