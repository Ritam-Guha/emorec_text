hi i'm dr alvarez with endobariatric.com,1.12,6.4
and today we will be talking about,4.56,5.03
gastroparesis,7.52,5.3
[Music],9.59,3.23
gastroparesis is a condition that,17.88,5.319
affects the normal spontaneous movements,20.32,5.68
of the muscles also known as motility,23.199,4.4
inside your stomach,26.0,4.16
ordinarily strong muscular contractions,27.599,5.681
propel food through your digestive tract,30.16,5.68
but if you do have gastroparesis your,33.28,6.4
stomach's motility is slowed down or,35.84,5.92
doesn't work at all preventing your,39.68,5.039
stomach from emptying properly,41.76,5.119
the cause of gastroparesis is usually,44.719,4.481
unknown sometimes it's a direct,46.879,4.401
complication of diabetes,49.2,4.96
and certain medications such as opioid,51.28,5.04
pain relievers sometimes some,54.16,3.919
antidepressants sometimes high blood,56.32,3.2
pressure medication,58.079,4.64
or some allergy medications can lead to,59.52,6.24
slow gastric emptying and cause very,62.719,6.08
similar symptoms for people who already,65.76,5.44
have gastroparesis these medications,68.799,4.401
will make their condition or their,71.2,4.88
symptoms worse,73.2,5.84
gastroparesis can interfere with normal,76.08,6.16
digestion can cause nausea vomiting,79.04,5.6
abdominal pain it can also cause,82.24,4.72
problems with blood sugar levels and,84.64,3.92
nutrition,86.96,4.32
some signs and symptoms of gastroparesis,88.56,5.919
include vomiting nausea abdominal,91.28,5.199
bloating abdominal pain,94.479,4.96
a feeling of fullness after eating just,96.479,4.561
a few bites,99.439,2.841
vomiting,101.04,4.24
undigested food eaten a few hours,102.28,5.879
earlier acid reflux very common among,105.28,6.159
other conditions and other symptoms,108.159,6.0
it is important to point out that many,111.439,5.121
people with gastroparesis,114.159,5.6
don't have any noticeable signs or,116.56,5.68
symptoms it's not always clear what,119.759,5.36
leads to gastroparesis but in some cases,122.24,5.6
it can be caused by damage to a nerve,125.119,5.441
that controls the stomach muscles also,127.84,5.6
known as the vagus nerve,130.56,5.92
factors that can increase the risk of,133.44,5.92
developing gastroparesis are diabetes,136.48,4.64
that we mentioned already,139.36,4.8
abdominal or esophageal surgery,141.12,4.0
that,144.16,3.36
damaged the vagus nerve,145.12,5.04
infection usually from a virus certain,147.52,4.64
medications that slow down the rate of,150.16,3.439
the stomach,152.16,3.28
the way it empties,153.599,4.321
such as the narcotic or pain medications,155.44,3.6
that we mentioned,157.92,2.959
certain conditions like,159.04,3.52
connective tissue diseases like,160.879,3.841
scleroderma,162.56,4.24
nervous system diseases such as,164.72,4.48
parkinson's disease or multiple,166.8,3.76
sclerosis,169.2,4.64
and your thyroid under active thyroid,170.56,5.399
condition also known as,173.84,5.119
hypothyroidism and very important that,175.959,5.56
women are more likely to develop,178.959,6.801
gastroparesis than men are,181.519,7.521
the diagnosis well it's made using,185.76,5.52
several tests to help identify,189.04,4.559
gastroparesis and to rule out,191.28,5.44
other conditions that may cause similar,193.599,6.0
symptoms tests may include gastric,196.72,6.239
emptying tests or upper endoscopy,199.599,5.121
although there is no cure for,202.959,3.441
gastroparesis,204.72,4.239
changes to your diet along with some,206.4,6.08
medication can offer some relief,208.959,6.0
treating gastroparesis begins with,212.48,5.119
identifying and treating the underlying,214.959,3.761
condition,217.599,4.321
if diabetes is the cause of the,218.72,6.32
gastroparesis your doctor can work with,221.92,5.52
you to help you take control of this,225.04,4.0
situation,227.44,4.24
maintaining adequate nutrition is the,229.04,5.52
most important goal in the treatment of,231.68,5.199
gastroparesis,234.56,4.8
many people can manage gastroparesis,236.879,4.801
with dietary changes,239.36,4.959
medications to treat gastroparesis may,241.68,3.759
include,244.319,3.761
medications that stimulate the stomach's,245.439,5.52
muscles and include menopause which is,248.08,3.92
reglan,250.959,4.721
or erythromycin now metoclopramid is a,252.0,6.479
medication that has um has a very high,255.68,4.0
risk of,258.479,4.801
serious side effects and erythromycin,259.68,6.56
may lose its effectiveness over time and,263.28,4.8
can cause some side effects such as,266.24,3.12
diarrhea,268.08,3.28
there is a newer medication which is,269.36,4.32
dome peridone and this has,271.36,4.48

the availability is restricted,275.84,5.919
drugs that can help ease nausea of,278.96,4.64
course or vomiting,281.759,3.841
include defending drumin which is,283.6,6.48

the sleep gastrectomy or gastric sleeve,298.24,5.36
has been shown to help patients,301.039,5.521
struggling with gastroparesis since it,303.6,6.56
stimulates a rapid gastric emptying at,306.56,5.919
the same time the sleep gastrectomy,310.16,4.319
surgery will promote weight loss and,312.479,3.841
