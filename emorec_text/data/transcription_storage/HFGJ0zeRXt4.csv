"- Hi, my name is Dr. Stephen Merena.",5.577,2.208
I'm a practicing podiatrist,7.785,1.373
"at the University of
Vermont Medical Center.",9.158,2.218
And I'm here today to talk,11.376,1.035
about diabetic foot self examination tips.,12.411,3.457
"Diabetic patients have
a lot of complications",15.868,3.216
"that can occur in different
parts of their body.",19.084,2.282
"One of the more common
places to encounter problems",21.366,2.579
is with your feet.,23.945,1.401
The things that can lead towards problems,25.346,1.613
with diabetic feet include,26.959,1.542
"progressive numbness in
your feet called neuropathy.",28.501,3.025
Or circulatory changes that can make,31.526,1.776
sores difficult to heal if they develop.,33.302,2.93
A diabetic foot exam is important,36.232,2.457
such that you can detect problems,38.689,1.551
early on in the process,40.24,1.854
and deal with them in a timely fashion,42.094,1.783
so as to avoid some of the later problems,43.877,2.763
that can be catastrophic.,46.64,1.848
"Now when you inspect your feet,",48.488,1.703
"you want to make sure that
you have a good light source.",50.191,2.421
"You want to make sure you use
corrective lenses if needed.",52.612,2.657
"And you want to make
sure that you evaluate",55.269,2.99
each and every part of your foot.,58.259,1.823
"If we look specifically at those parts,",60.082,2.237
we start with the toenails,62.319,1.527
"and looking around the edges
of the nails in particular.",63.846,2.502
"In between the toes,",66.348,1.252
you want to make sure,67.6,0.833
that you're not seeing any sort of cracks,68.433,1.696
or fissuring within the skin.,70.129,1.988
"And then a complete exam
along the bottom of your foot.",72.117,2.761
"Now for some of us, it's difficult",74.878,1.384
to accurately contort yourself,76.262,2.49
or look at the bottom of your foot,78.752,2.016
"such that you're going to
get that information back.",80.768,2.928
Using a mirror can sometimes be helpful.,83.696,2.701
Some mirrors may be equipped with a handle,86.397,2.02
that can make it easier for you to look,88.417,2.657
"and inspect the bottom
of your foot accurately.",91.074,2.438
"If this is not realistic for you,",93.512,2.043
reaching out to friends or family,95.555,1.806
to help you inspect your feet,97.361,1.861
is an important thing to consider as well.,99.222,2.742
"In particular, when you're
inspecting your feet,",101.964,2.253
keep any eye out for bony prominences,104.217,1.981
from one end of the foot to the other.,106.198,1.909
"In particular, look for the bony areas",108.107,2.06
"around your ankle, around
the back or underside",110.167,2.68
"of your heel, and
especially around the ball",112.847,2.168
of the foot and toes.,115.015,1.795
"These are areas that
can be easily irritated",116.81,2.382
"just from pressure from shoe gear,",119.192,1.559
"or from either lying in
bed from the pressure",120.751,2.718
from the underlying mattress.,123.469,2.066
"As part of your foot exam,",125.535,1.159
"you should also make sure
to inspect your shoe gear",126.694,2.686
"and to make sure that
they're fitting you properly,",129.38,2.615
"looking for signs of wear
and tear with the shoes,",131.995,2.682
and also to reach inside the shoes,134.677,1.408
to make sure there are no foreign objects,136.085,2.028
that could cause problems for your feet.,138.113,2.075
"Now along with a daily
inspection of your feet,",140.188,2.956
"you should also keep these
other things in mind.",143.144,2.203
Proper foot hygiene is a must,145.347,1.538
for every diabetic patient.,146.885,1.656
And you should also look to avoid,148.541,1.589
walking barefoot at all times.,150.13,1.96
"Make sure that the shoes that
you wear fit you properly.",152.09,2.82
"If a problem develops,",154.91,1.372
there are different ways it may present.,156.282,1.818
"For example, around the toenails,",158.1,2.024
"sometimes it'll be thickness,
discoloration, or redness.",160.124,3.867
"Sometimes drainage from
underneath the nail",163.991,2.418
"can present as an early
warning sign or problem.",166.409,3.089
"In between the toes, redness, fissuring,",169.498,2.302
or drainage can also occur.,171.8,1.69
"Open wounds or thickened skin
on the bottom of your foot",173.49,3.292
"that can be painless can
also be an early sign",176.782,2.586
of a bigger problem.,179.368,1.467
"Your skin acts as a barrier
for your entire body,",180.835,3.364
including your feet.,184.199,1.403
It's important to maintain that barrier.,185.602,2.326
"Anytime there's a breakdown,",187.928,1.568
"that's an opportunity for
bacteria to get in there",189.496,2.24
and cause a serious problem.,191.736,2.339
"If you see any signs of skin breakdown,",194.075,2.709
"redness or swelling, especially
in the absence of pain,",196.784,3.404
"it is extremely important
that you reach out",200.188,1.986
"to your healthcare
professional immediately.",202.174,2.281
Some diabetic foot problems can be treated,204.455,2.444
fairly quickly and easily,206.899,1.683
"without too much interference
in one's lifestyle.",208.582,2.963
"However, some problems can
lead to more significant issues",211.545,3.59
"that can result in open
sores with your feet.",215.135,3.65
"It can also lead towards infection,",218.785,2.396
"hospitalization, or in
the worst case scenario,",221.181,2.65
"it could result in
surgery or loss of limb.",223.831,3.195
"So in order to avoid this, you
want to stay on top of things",227.026,2.788
on a regular basis.,229.814,1.294
