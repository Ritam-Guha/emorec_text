hba1c is a commonly used diabetes term,0.89,5.05
so it's important to understand what it,4.02,3.96
means and the role it plays in modern,5.94,3.409
diabetes care,7.98,4.86
simply put hba1c readings are an average,9.349,5.17
measurement of how well controlled,12.84,3.63
glucose levels have been over the last,14.519,3.201
two to three months,16.47,4.77
the term hba1c refers to glice ated,17.72,5.979
hemoglobin which is a molecule that,21.24,4.41
forms when glucose joins with the,23.699,4.08
protein in the red blood cells that's,25.65,5.82
known as hemoglobin to test for hba1c a,27.779,6.12
doctor will take a blood sample usually,31.47,4.44
from the arm and use it to measure how,33.899,4.201
much glucose has stuck to the hemoglobin,35.91,5.579
in the bloodstream hemoglobin molecules,38.1,5.19
tend to live 812 weeks,41.489,4.861
so by taking a hba1c measurement you get,43.29,4.98
a long-term trend of how high or low,46.35,4.139
blood sugar levels have been over that,48.27,4.769
period of time the target for people,50.489,5.311
with diabetes is scatter hba1c reading,53.039,5.941
of under 6.5 percent the results are,55.8,4.829
either expressed as a percentage as,58.98,4.29
millimoles per mole in which case you're,60.629,5.301
aiming for under 48 millimoles per mole,63.27,5.25
some people will be set less challenging,65.93,4.93
targets by their doctor especially if,68.52,4.43
they have a history of hypoglycemia,70.86,4.649
generally speaking the lower your hba1c,72.95,4.989
reading is the better your blood glucose,75.509,4.411
control is likely to be which means,77.939,3.451
there will be a lower risk of developing,79.92,4.589
serious long-term complications large,81.39,4.619
scale studies have shown that people,84.509,3.621
with type 1 diabetes and type 2 diabetes,86.009,5.161
who managed to lower their hba1c reading,88.13,6.43
by just 1% or 11 millimoles or mul can,91.17,4.68
drastically reduce their chance of,94.56,3.78
developing long-term complications this,95.85,5.22
includes diabetic retinopathy neuropathy,98.34,5.489
and nephropathy as well as amputations,101.07,5.79
cataracts and heart failure you should,103.829,5.07
have your hba1c tested at least once a,106.86,4.5
year in most cases your GP can do this,108.899,4.11
himself but you may be sent to the,111.36,3.21
phlebotomy clinic of your local hospital,113.009,4.201
a lot of people get confused about the,114.57,6.39
unit's used to hba1c as in 2011 who has,117.21,5.79
changed from a percentage into a,120.96,4.799
measurement in millimoles per mole you,123.0,4.86
can find our hba1c units converter on,125.759,4.78
the diabetes coder UK website,127.86,5.14
it can convert percentages into a,130.539,4.32
minimum per mole measurement or vice,133.0,3.89
