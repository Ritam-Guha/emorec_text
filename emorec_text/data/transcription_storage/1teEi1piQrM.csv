John Brill: My community education project,0.69,2.42
"was to develop a patient education handout
detailing",3.11,3.93
"how to use short acting insulin. The patient
that was",7.04,5.9
"the trigger for this idea was a patient of
mine at St.",12.94,3.83
"Luke's Family Practice Center on the south
side of",16.77,2.9
"Milwaukee. She was a 72-year-old Latino woman
who had",19.67,3.17
"had diabetes for about eight years with never
very",22.84,3.449
"good control. Her last couple of hemoglobin
A1Cs",26.289,2.621
had been in the 8 to 9 range. She was on the,28.91,3.73
"maximally tolerated doses of oral medications
that she",32.64,3.32
"could take. And I broached the idea of insulin
a",35.96,4.039
"couple of times, but she was really pretty
opposed to",39.999,3.261
"trying that and really didn't want to go there.
Of",43.26,3.66
"course, on a weekend when I was out of town,
she had a",46.92,4.579
"heart attack, and was admitted to the hospital.
In",51.499,3.45
"the hospital she was started on insulin because
of not",54.949,3.12
"wanting to use her oral medications. She did
receive",58.069,4.42
"teaching from a diabetic educator while there,
and was",62.489,3.951
"given prescriptions for all of the necessary
equipment",66.44,3.34
"and insulin and was sent home with that. But
she",69.78,4.27
"called me a couple days later saying that
her blood",74.05,2.27
"sugars were running high and in talking with
her, I",76.32,2.72
"discovered that she wasn't using the short
acting",79.04,2.39
"insulin at all, she was just using her glargine",81.43,4.02
"insulin. And I wasn't able to quite get to
the bottom",85.45,4.72
"of why she wasn't using it on the phone, so
I asked",90.17,3.26
"her to come in for a session with some of
our clinic",93.43,2.59
"staff. Just as a little bit of background
on",96.02,4.6
"diabetes, diabetes is one of the most common
and",100.62,3.65
"severe health care problems currently facing
people in",104.27,3.12
"the United States. There is over 17 million
people",107.39,3.05
"with diabetes, which is about 8% of all adults
and the",110.44,4.281
"prevalence is increasing tremendously, 13%
in the last",114.721,2.959
"three years alone. Some of this is probably
due to",117.68,2.82
"increased testing and increased detection,
but some of",120.5,3.15
"it is also probably due to increasing prevalence,",123.65,3.35
"mostly related to obesity. We're starting
to see",127.0,2.67
"younger and younger people even middle school
students",129.67,2.95
"developing type 2 diabetes. In diabetes is
very much",132.62,4.66
"an issue for primary care, it's one of the
top ten",137.28,2.44
reasons why people come to see a primary care,139.72,3.16
"physician, and it's also one of the, one of
the",142.88,3.7
"biggest, if not probably the single disease
that costs",146.58,2.89
"the most amount of money in the United States.
In",149.47,3.29
"2007, 174 billion dollars was spent on direct
and",152.76,5.19
"indirect costs of diabetes, that's almost
10% of all",157.95,3.131
"health care dollars according to the American
Diabetes",161.081,4.039
"Association. And diabetics are treated as,
you know,",165.12,5.78
"in a couple of different ways. About 1 out
of 6 is",170.9,2.78
currently treated just with therapeutic lifestyle,173.68,2.1
"changes, over half are on oral medications
alone, but",175.78,4.15
"almost 30% are on insulin either by itself
or in",179.93,3.52
"combination with oral agents. So getting back
to our",183.45,6.99
"patient, she met with a pharmd and a nurse
to go over",190.44,4.5
"how to use her insulin. I had questioned,
the patient",194.94,4.05
"is latina, she's pretty bilingual, but I had
a",198.99,3.079
"question in my mind if that might be part
of the",202.069,2.112
"issue, but both the pharmd and the nurse that
she met",204.181,2.849
with were bilingual and said that she understood,207.03,2.78
"English as well. It turned out that she was
very",209.81,3.49
"afraid of hypoglycemia, she lives alone and
was very",213.3,3.39
"concern that had she could get hypoglycemic
and there",216.69,2.95
"would be no one to help her, so a very appropriate
and",219.64,2.42
"reasonable concern. And both the nurse and
the",222.06,3.83
"pharmacist commented that she just needed
a lot of",225.89,2.31
"repetition, a lot of reassurance, going through
things",228.2,2.64
"over and over. So it occurred to us that a
patient",230.84,4.02
"education handout or some materials that we
could give",234.86,2.78
"her to both help with the teaching as well
as to have",237.64,5.04
"some reinforcement at home would be very helpful.
So",242.68,4.57
"I started to look for something like this.
I looked",247.25,3.129
through patient education materials that were,250.379,2.101
"available from the American Diabetes Association,
from",252.48,3.19
"familydoctor.org, which is the patient education",255.67,4.33
"website of the American Academy of Family
Physicians,",260.0,3.52
"from some Aurora resources, also just did
a Google",263.52,3.91
"search for patient education handouts on short
acting",267.43,3.69
"insulin and diabetes. There is also a website
which",271.12,3.29
"is called two tuotromedica.com which has lots
of",274.41,4.43
"information in Spanish. What I turned up was
a number",278.84,6.76
"of websites which wasn't particularly useful
for this",285.6,3.111
"patient because she didn't have access to
them. Some",288.711,3.099
"of them kind of went through step by step
process. We",291.81,4.12
"found a number of handouts on how to give
insulin",295.93,3.14
"itself, which didn't really seem to be her
exact",299.07,3.349
"issue, but nothing very generally on how to
use short",302.419,3.371
"acting insulin. Most sites that I came across
seemed",305.79,3.92
"to be written at a pretty high educational
level, one",309.71,3.42
"exception being familydoctor.org which was
pretty easy",313.13,4.0
"to read. So we decided to create a patient
education",317.13,6.97
handout specifically on how to use short acting,324.1,3.02
"insulin. We wanted it to be very simple, easy
to",327.12,3.62
"remember, and we came up with a mnemonic of
TIE, for",330.74,3.78
"test, insulin, eat. We wanted it to be visually",334.52,4.45
"attractive, something people would want to
maybe put",338.97,2.509
"on that I refrigerator, have some simple pictures
and",341.479,3.121
"be easy to read. And have a reading level
that was at",344.6,5.14
"a minimum for all patients. So the memory
scheme that",349.74,6.2
"we came up with is TIE, which stands for test,
insulin",355.94,2.949
"and eat. There are lots of handouts that show
how to",358.889,3.711
"use glucometer and lancets to check your blood
sugar,",362.6,4.47
"so we felt we could tie that into existing
handouts.",367.07,3.599
"Giving insulin, and again, lots of already
existing",370.669,3.47
"information about how to do the injection,
and then",374.139,3.301
"eating, so needing to have something in your
system to",377.44,3.97
"prevent hypoglycemia. In terms of the process
for",381.41,6.34
"this, we first I wrote a draft of it, I talked
over",387.75,4.57
"with one of our pharmacists who suggested
some",392.32,2.48
"additional medications and also suggested
having some",394.8,4.089
sliding scale component to it. We did a readability,398.889,2.961
"test. Initially it was written at a 12th grade
level,",401.85,3.05
"and there is, it doesn't give you really instructions",404.9,3.38
"on how to decrease that, so I had to kind
of play",408.28,2.44
"around with that. I found that most of this
high",410.72,3.39
"reading level was from a lot of polysyllabic
words,",414.11,3.19
"and getting rid of a number of those brought
it down",417.3,2.33
"to a 7th grade reading level. I then piloted
it with",419.63,3.73
"a couple of patients to get their thoughts
and input",423.36,2.5
and opinions. I didn't really get any very,425.86,3.21
"constructive criticism from them, but they
did give me",429.07,3.95
"some ways that they thought it could be useful.
Some",433.02,5.519
"of the challenges that we encountered were
how to lay",438.539,2.541
"it out in such a way that it was friendly,
still kept",441.08,4.05
"attractive, had enough information but not
too much,",445.13,4.379
"again, how to get to the low reading level,
how to use",449.509,2.611
"words that replace some of those longer words,
and",452.12,4.45
sometimes there is no really shorter equivalent.,456.57,5.189
"Integrating the sliding scales with a bit
of a",461.759,1.921
"challenge, too. We decided to keep it very
simple",463.68,2.329
"with just a one step for if the blood sugar
was too",466.009,3.681
"high and one step for if it was too low. And
then",469.69,3.64
"found some pictures. And this was actually
a little",473.33,2.459
bit of a challenge than I expected. We found,475.789,2.641
"initially a number of pictures that were in
color, but",478.43,3.85
"found that when we reproduced them in black
and white,",482.28,2.9
"the plate of food that looked delicious and
wonderful",485.18,2.49
"and diverse in color looked like a mash of
not really",487.67,3.83
"anything when it was in black and white. So
we think",491.5,5.86
"that this patient education handout can be
useful for",497.36,5.02
"primary care physicians who are talking with
their",502.38,2.2
"patients about going on insulin or who might
need it",504.58,3.32
"in the future to try to quiet down some of
their",507.9,2.45
"concerns. It might help the staff time, especially
in",510.35,4.499
places that don't have ready access to diabetic,514.849,3.63
"educators or nurse educators or pharmacists
that can",518.479,3.94
"assist. And for patients, it could be helpful
in a",522.419,3.831
"couple of ways. One is to reassure that they're
not",526.25,4.35
"going to become hypoglycemic, to kind of keep
the",530.6,2.83
"order of events in mind, and also contains
a",533.43,2.89
"references for what doses to use. Again, something",536.32,2.84
that they could kind of put on their refrigerator,539.16,1.77
"refer to. Some of the limitations of this,
it doesn't",540.93,5.79
"talk about the longer acting insulin. I guess
my",546.72,3.2
"experience has been that that hasn't been
as much of",549.92,2.22
"an issue, and that is something that probably
could be",552.14,3.38
"just written in or added. It does reference
some",555.52,4.03
"other handouts for injection and also for
how to, how",559.55,5.17
"to handle hypoglycemia, so patients would
need to have",564.72,3.53
"access to those as well. Only a very simple
sliding",568.25,3.89
"scale and the notion here was just that it
would get",572.14,2.84
"too complicated and too wordy if we tried
to put in",574.98,2.88
"more details about that. A problem with using
a paper",577.86,4.66
"form is that any time one's insulin doses
were",582.52,3.05
"changed, you would have to give a whole new
form or",585.57,2.32
"else start writing it and start crossing things
out",587.89,1.91
"which could get pretty messy. And just again,
with",589.8,3.17
"the paper format, in a full page like this,
it's",592.97,2.33
"probably not something that patients would
take with",595.3,1.84
"them. So some future steps that could be useful
for",597.14,7.25
"this, one would be to translate into Spanish,
in",604.39,3.79
"particular, because of the high rates of diabetes
in",608.18,3.58
"the Latino population as well as into Hmong.
It would",611.76,4.51
be nice to have more culturally diverse patient,616.27,3.73
"pictures, although actually, that was one
thing where",620.0,2.88
"going into black and white sort of blurred
those",622.88,2.21
"lines, but especially with the high prevalence
of",625.09,3.49
"diabetes in African American patients, it
would be",628.58,2.08
"nice to have pictures that reflect other cultures.
It",630.66,6.02
"would be potentially useful to have another
version",636.68,3.24
"that had a more complex sliding scale, so
could just",639.92,3.82
"replace this sliding scale section with one
that had a",643.74,4.07
"more specific range. And finally, a really",647.81,5.02
"interesting idea that came up as we were talking,
was",652.83,2.86
"that many of the glucometers now really have
a lot of",655.69,2.589
"memory, and it would be interesting to work
with some",658.279,3.481
glucometer manufacturers to have more reference,661.76,4.61
"information for patients. So it seems like
it would",666.37,3.23
"be relatively simple to have a handout like
this that",669.6,3.56
"was part of a glucometer software package,
a way to",673.16,3.369
"program the glucometer to include the doses
of insulin",676.529,3.941
"that the patient is on. It would be ideal
to have the",680.47,5.41
"sliding scale, for example, pop up telling
the patient",685.88,3.31
"exactly how much insulin they should use depending
on",689.19,3.05
"what their blood sugars were. So overall,
we thought",692.24,3.16
"that this would be a really useful handout
that could",695.4,3.57
"help with the almost 30% of diabetics in this
country",698.97,3.58
that are using insulin. Any questions?,702.55,2.849
