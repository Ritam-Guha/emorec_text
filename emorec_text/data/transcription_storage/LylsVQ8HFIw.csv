in the late 70s dr david jenkins of the,0.719,5.361
university of toronto realized that,4.08,4.24
knowing the total amount of carbs in,6.08,4.16
foods was not enough to predict the,8.32,4.16
effects of these sugars on blood glucose,10.24,3.519
fluctuations,12.48,3.359
knowing the type of carbs containing a,13.759,4.161
food simple sugars or complex,15.839,3.2
carbohydrates,17.92,3.279
provided some clues but was far from,19.039,4.881
sufficient to make a correct prediction,21.199,4.32
there are some foods that are rich in,23.92,3.76
complex starches such as white bread,25.519,4.08
that raise blood glucose quickly and,27.68,4.16
abruptly whereas some fruits rich in,29.599,3.281
simple sugars,31.84,3.44
such as blueberries barely raise blood,32.88,3.76
glucose at all,35.28,4.799
in 1981 jenkins and co-workers published,36.64,4.239
a landmark,40.079,2.48
article in the american journal of,40.879,3.601
clinical nutrition in which they,42.559,3.68
proposed a new indicator,44.48,4.239
that was able to measure the speed at,46.239,5.281
which sugars containing a specific food,48.719,5.121
would raise blood glucose and they call,51.52,3.359
this indicator,53.84,4.16
glycemic index propelled by numerous,54.879,5.281
findings about the detrimental effects,58.0,4.239
of repeated and elevated blood glucose,60.16,3.199
and insulin peaks,62.239,3.2
and their risk for fat accumulation,63.359,4.321
obesity diabetes and cardiovascular,65.439,2.961
disease,67.68,3.2
the concept of glycemic index soon,68.4,4.24
became very popular,70.88,4.239
the higher the glycemic index of a food,72.64,4.08
the faster its carbs,75.119,3.601
enter the bloodstream and raise blood,76.72,4.0
glucose causing the pancreas,78.72,4.719
to release insulin you may wonder how,80.72,4.56
this index is calculated,83.439,4.081
in a few words here's how you take a,85.28,4.799
solution of 50 grams of glucose in water,87.52,3.84
and you give it to a group of,90.079,2.321
individuals,91.36,3.36
then for the next two hours you draw a,92.4,4.32
drop of blood by finger puncture at,94.72,2.56
regular,96.72,2.719
intervals and you measure blood glucose,97.28,3.519
concentrations,99.439,2.96
in this example you see that blood,100.799,4.0
glucose peaks between 30 minutes and 1,102.399,3.04
hour,104.799,2.881
and after 2 hours is almost back to,105.439,3.441
baseline,107.68,3.84
if you measure the area below this curve,108.88,4.559
you know it's proportional to the amount,111.52,2.559
of glucose,113.439,2.64
that was in the bloodstream during these,114.079,3.201
two hours,116.079,3.441
then you take the same subjects and you,117.28,3.119
have them eat,119.52,3.68
a test food say a bowl of lentils in,120.399,4.641
such an amount that the quantity of,123.2,2.879
carbs they contain,125.04,3.439
is still 50 grams let me stress this,126.079,4.481
again you're not giving them 50 grams of,128.479,2.721
lentils,130.56,3.039
but a serving of lentils that provides,131.2,4.16
50 grams of carbs,133.599,3.601
now you do the same measurement and in,135.36,3.599
this example you see that the peak is,137.2,3.52
about at the same time but it's much,138.959,2.401
lower,140.72,3.12
and it doesn't decline as fast of course,141.36,4.0
different people will respond in,143.84,2.479
different ways,145.36,2.72
but this doesn't matter because you can,146.319,4.0
use the first measurement to standardize,148.08,3.36
the result,150.319,3.041
so you calculate the area under the,151.44,3.439
curve for your lentils,153.36,3.68
and divide it by the area you obtain for,154.879,3.601
the solution of glucose,157.04,4.0
times 100 to get rid of the decimals and,158.48,4.479
there you have your glycemic index of,161.04,2.88
lentils,162.959,3.28
if you have worked well you will get,163.92,4.24
very similar numbers in all your,166.239,3.521
different subjects,168.16,3.76
to complicate things some labs have,169.76,4.559
chosen not to use glucose in water as a,171.92,3.12
standard,174.319,3.681
but white bread this has advantages and,175.04,5.04
disadvantages whose discussion goes,178.0,4.08
beyond the scope of our course,180.08,3.519
just keep in mind that you cannot,182.08,4.239
compare gi numbers from different tables,183.599,4.64
if they are calculated using different,186.319,3.041
standards,188.239,3.681
the numbers i will show you here are all,189.36,4.48
calculated using glucose,191.92,5.36
as a standard the concept of glycemic,193.84,4.16
index is,197.28,3.599
often misunderstood so let me clarify a,198.0,3.28
very,200.879,3.601
important point the glycemic index is a,201.28,5.039
measure of the speed,204.48,4.479
at which the carbs in a food raise blood,206.319,3.681
glucose levels,208.959,3.601
it is not a measure of the extent of,210.0,3.519
this effect,212.56,2.72
because the glycemic index is,213.519,4.241
independent of the amounts of carb,215.28,5.36
contained in a food think of a man,217.76,4.479
target shooting with a gun,220.64,4.0
the glycemic index would tell us how,222.239,4.161
fast he shoots his bullets,224.64,3.679
but he does not tell us how many bullets,226.4,3.119
he has to shoot,228.319,3.601
if he only has a few bullets he can,229.519,4.321
shoot them as fast as he wants,231.92,4.319
but he'll still not be very deadly so,233.84,4.88
the glycemic index only makes sense,236.239,4.801
if we consider it together with another,238.72,3.68
piece of information,241.04,3.919
which is the amount of carbs contained,242.4,3.52
in that food,244.959,3.2
for example carrots have a relatively,245.92,3.84
high glycemic index,248.159,3.841
but they also have very little sugar,249.76,3.92
this means their sugar enters the,252.0,2.4
bloodstream,253.68,3.119
fast but because it's very small amount,254.4,4.64
the overall effect of carrots on blood,256.799,3.84
glucose and insulin release,259.04,4.4
is minimal conversely the glycemic index,260.639,4.801
of potatoes is lower than that of,263.44,2.64
carrots,265.44,2.479
but while an average carrot has about,266.08,3.28
four grams of carbs,267.919,4.481
an average potato has about 25 grams,269.36,5.44
so even if these carbs are absorbed more,272.4,4.4
slowly they still have a significant,274.8,3.6
effect on blood glucose,276.8,4.24
and insulin because they are a lot to,278.4,3.6
take into account,281.04,3.2
was the glycemic index and the total,282.0,3.6
amount of carbs,284.24,3.6
a group of researchers from harvard,285.6,5.44
university proposed in 1997 the concept,287.84,4.4
of glycemic,291.04,3.76
load it is very simple it's just a,292.24,4.48
glycemic index of a food,294.8,4.32
times the amount of digestible carbs,296.72,4.64
contained in a standard serving of that,299.12,2.799
food,301.36,3.119
divided by 100 just to get rid of some,301.919,3.601
zeros,304.479,2.801
this way you have an index that,305.52,3.679
considers both factors,307.28,4.72
if a food has a low gi but a lot of,309.199,3.521
sugars,312.0,2.96
its glycemic load will still be high,312.72,3.12
conversely,314.96,3.519
if it has a high glycemic index but very,315.84,3.68
few sugars,318.479,2.961
its glycemic load will still be,319.52,3.44
relatively low,321.44,3.759
let's go back to our previous example,322.96,4.56
and let's consider a glycemic index of,325.199,5.361
72 for carrots and of 63 for boiled,327.52,4.0
potatoes,330.56,3.359
the glycemic load over carrot would be,331.52,4.88
72 times 4 grams of carbs,333.919,5.84
divided by 103 the glycemic load of our,336.4,5.28
potato would be 63,339.759,6.081
times 25 grams of carbs divided by 116.,341.68,6.239
so the glycemic load of our potato is,345.84,4.24
more than five fold the glycemic load of,347.919,2.961
our carrot,350.08,3.839
even though its glycemic index is slower,350.88,5.92
watermelon also has a high glycemic,353.919,4.4
index of 72,356.8,4.88
but a slice of 120 grams only has,358.319,6.32
6 grams of sugar so its glycemic load is,361.68,3.6
4.,364.639,3.12
a banana of the same weight has a much,365.28,4.72
lower glycemic index 52,367.759,4.56
but it has 20 grams of carbs so its,370.0,4.0
glycemic load is 11,372.319,4.72
almost three times that of watermelon of,374.0,5.039
course the glycemic load has one big,377.039,2.961
disadvantage,379.039,3.041
compared to the glycemic index the,380.0,4.72
glycemic index is always the same,382.08,4.959
independent of the amount of food the,384.72,4.16
glycemic load is always,387.039,4.88
based on a specific amount of food if i,388.88,3.439
eat,391.919,3.28
three slices of watermelon the glycemic,392.319,5.041
load would be three times higher,395.199,4.321
while the glycemic index would still be,397.36,3.36
72.,399.52,4.56
take this coke its glycemic index is 58.,400.72,6.8
a small 100 milliliters glass a,404.08,6.559
meals can or a large 600 meals fast food,407.52,3.679
cup,410.639,3.521
all have a glycemic index of 58 but the,411.199,5.12
small glass has 11 grams of sugar,414.16,5.36
with a glycemic load of 6.4 the can is,416.319,5.041
37 grams of sugar,419.52,5.04
glycemic load 21.5 and the large cup,421.36,6.839
67 grams of sugar and a glycemic load of,424.56,4.88
38.9,428.199,4.601
and by the way 266 calories,429.44,5.759
the composition of a food is of course,432.8,3.76
the first determinant,435.199,4.321
of its glycemic index in particular two,436.56,3.84
key factors,439.52,3.36
are the type of carbs and the presence,440.4,3.919
of other nutrients,442.88,3.92
as far as simple sugars are concerned,444.319,4.88
glucose raises the glycemic index,446.8,5.28
much more than fructose sucrose is in,449.199,5.041
between since it mixes the two,452.08,4.88
as for complex carbs the more branched,454.24,3.679
starch is,456.96,3.359
the lower the glycemic index because it,457.919,4.641
will take longer to break it down,460.319,4.641
as for other nutrients the presence of,462.56,5.039
fiber proteins and lipids slows down,464.96,4.32
gastric emptying and intestinal,467.599,2.961
absorption of glucose,469.28,3.44
thus lowering the glycemic index of a,470.56,4.8
food it is easy to understand why whole,472.72,4.64
grains and their derivative products,475.36,4.48
have lower glycemic indexes than their,477.36,4.48
refined counterparts,479.84,4.16
but many other factors affect the,481.84,4.079
glycemic index of a food,484.0,4.479
including preparation processing and,485.919,3.441
cooking,488.479,3.601
let's consider our potato again if we,489.36,3.6
snack on it,492.08,3.6
raw its glycemic index will be close to,492.96,5.12
zero because the starch of a raw potato,495.68,3.04
is almost,498.08,3.36
entirely undigestible so it will travel,498.72,4.8
intact through our small intestine,501.44,4.72
without absorption if we boil that,503.52,3.359
potato,506.16,3.439
its glycemic index will quickly raise to,506.879,5.6
about 60 because starch gelatinizes with,509.599,3.36
heat,512.479,3.12
and becomes easily digestible if however,512.959,3.121
we eat,515.599,3.68
that same potato with its skin its fiber,516.08,5.36
will slow down glucose digestion and,519.279,3.361
absorption,521.44,4.24
and as a result its gi will be lower,522.64,5.52
conversely if we turn that potato into a,525.68,3.76
mashed potato,528.16,4.16
its gi will further raise because starch,529.44,3.36
becomes,532.32,2.8
even more accessible to our digestive,532.8,4.64
enzymes which will convert it to glucose,535.12,3.68
even faster,537.44,3.6
finally if we don't eat our potato at,538.8,4.56
all and just leave it there at room temp,541.04,4.64
within a few hours its starch will start,543.36,4.4
retrogradation becoming less and less,545.68,3.04
digestible,547.76,4.0
and its gi will progressively decrease,548.72,4.96
together with the desirability of our,551.76,4.16
potato which will become less and less,553.68,5.12
soft and buttery the degree of cooking,555.92,4.16
always matters,558.8,3.84
if raw pasta has a glycemic index close,560.08,3.439
to zero,562.64,3.44
al dente pasta the way we italians like,563.519,4.241
it still somewhat firm,566.08,4.24
has a gi of about 50 because part of its,567.76,5.44
starch is still harder to digest,570.32,5.199
conversely overcooked pasta to the point,573.2,3.68
it becomes soft,575.519,3.921
that you somehow appear to like has a gi,576.88,4.48
about 10 points higher because its,579.44,2.64
starch,581.36,3.599
turns to glucose much faster some,582.08,4.64
technological processes,584.959,4.88
also fragment starch raising gi,586.72,5.52
such as extrusion to make potato chips,589.839,3.601
or corn flakes,592.24,4.64
or pressure steaming to make puffed rice,593.44,6.16
as far as fruit is concerned the degree,596.88,3.68
of ripeness,599.6,4.08
influences the gi as the fruit ripens,600.56,5.68
its acids are converted to sugars the,603.68,4.32
texture becomes softer,606.24,4.8
and the gi tends to increase an overripe,608.0,5.68
banana will have a higher glycemic index,611.04,5.12
that one that's still green and then of,613.68,4.399
course peeling fruits and veggies,616.16,4.239
always raises the gi because you remove,618.079,3.521
a lot of fiber,620.399,3.921
whenever we cut blend puree or in any,621.6,5.2
way turn the food into smaller pieces,624.32,5.28
the work of digestive enzymes is easier,626.8,4.96
and glucose absorption is faster,629.6,5.04
so the gi increases if you turn your,631.76,5.519
bottle of lentils into a lentil puree,634.64,5.439
its gi will be higher if you juice a,637.279,3.441
carrot,640.079,2.721
carrot juice will have a much higher gi,640.72,3.28
than the whole carrot,642.8,3.92
and so on so far we have talked about,644.0,4.959
individual foods but it is important to,646.72,4.16
remember that most of the time we,648.959,4.481
combine different foods in a meal,650.88,5.36
when we do that these foods mix in our,653.44,3.36
stomach,656.24,3.36
and get digested and absorbed together,656.8,3.279
so what,659.6,2.479
really matters in the end is not the,660.079,4.401
glycemic index or the glycemic load of,662.079,5.041
individual food items but the overall,664.48,5.52
glycemic load of the whole meal,667.12,5.68
let's suppose with our mashed potatoes,670.0,5.36
together with two slices of white bread,672.8,5.76
and a can of coke or let's imagine,675.36,5.12
eating the same mashed potato,678.56,4.64
with just one slice of whole wheat bread,680.48,4.24
with turkey and salad,683.2,4.48
and a can of diet coke what do you think,684.72,3.679
would become,687.68,3.279
of the glycemic load of the whole meal,688.399,4.321
in the first scenario we have combined,690.959,3.681
the high glycemic index food,692.72,4.16
our mashed potatoes with two other,694.64,3.84
glycemic index foods,696.88,3.92
white bread and coke so we have turned,698.48,4.4
our meal into a glycemic bond,700.8,3.84
which will make our blood glucose and,702.88,3.68
insulin skyrocket,704.64,3.68
in the other scenario we have,706.56,4.32
compensated the high glycemic index of,708.32,3.68
mashed potatoes,710.88,3.6
with the fiber and protein rich low,712.0,4.639
glycemic index whole wheat bread,714.48,4.56
green salad and turkey sandwich and a,716.639,5.2
sugar-free glycemic neutral diet coke,719.04,5.12
thus lowering the glycemic load of the,721.839,3.201
whole meal,724.16,4.239
so our pancreas will say thanks we will,725.04,5.52
go over food sources of carbs i will,728.399,3.921
show you some more glycemic index,730.56,3.12
numerical values,732.32,3.84
but make no mistake i'm not suggesting,733.68,4.32
that anybody should calculate the,736.16,3.919
glycemic index and glycemic loads of,738.0,3.2
their meals,740.079,2.801
we said at the beginning of our course,741.2,3.52
that no one should eat with tables and,742.88,3.04
calculators,744.72,3.679
besides if the concept of glycemic index,745.92,3.44
is impeccable,748.399,3.361
its numerical quantitation is rather,749.36,4.159
unprecise and variable,751.76,4.24
it's not just a problem of methodology,753.519,4.961
food in itself is highly variable,756.0,5.279
a carrot grown in italy can be extremely,758.48,5.12
different from a carrot grown in the u.s,761.279,4.401
different varieties different soil,763.6,4.08
different products used to grow it,765.68,4.24
different weather and so on and then,767.68,4.399
when it comes to food preparation such,769.92,3.919
as cookies or bread,772.079,3.601
we also have different ingredients,773.839,3.44
different proportions different,775.68,3.52
processing technologies,777.279,4.321
different cooking times or temperatures,779.2,4.319
you already know that all these factors,781.6,3.44
can greatly influence,783.519,4.56
the glycemic index if we insist on the,785.04,5.599
concept of glycemic index and glycemic,788.079,3.121
load,790.639,2.32
it's because they are very useful to,791.2,4.079
have an idea of the general metabolic,792.959,4.081
effect of different foods on blood,795.279,3.041
glucose and insulin,797.04,3.52
but certainly not to make numerical,798.32,4.079
calculations,800.56,4.48
so to recap the glycemic index is an,802.399,4.801
indicator that tells us how fast the,805.04,3.359
carbs in a food,807.2,3.92
are digested absorbed and raised blood,808.399,4.081
glucose levels,811.12,3.36
it is determined as a blood glucose,812.48,4.479
response after eating a specific food,814.48,4.32
compared to the response after eating a,816.959,3.041
standard food,818.8,3.44
glucose or white bread providing an,820.0,4.56
equivalent amount of carbohydrates,822.24,4.959
not an equivalent amount of food the,824.56,3.839
glycine index,827.199,4.0
only tells us how fast the carbs in a,828.399,3.361
food,831.199,4.08
raise glycemia not how much for that,831.76,5.439
we must also know how much carb is,835.279,4.0
inside a serving of that food,837.199,3.921
combining these two pieces of,839.279,3.601
information we can determine the,841.12,4.24
glycemic load of our meals,842.88,5.04
the general rule is that the glycemic,845.36,4.479
load of all of our meals should be as,847.92,3.359
slow as possible,849.839,3.68
we can accomplish this primarily in two,851.279,3.041
ways,853.519,4.081
one by choosing low glycemic index foods,854.32,6.56
or two by combining high glycemic index,857.6,3.84
foods,860.88,2.88
with low glycemic index fiber and,861.44,4.88
protein rich foods to lower the glycemic,863.76,2.96
load,866.32,5.519
of the overall meal,866.72,5.119
