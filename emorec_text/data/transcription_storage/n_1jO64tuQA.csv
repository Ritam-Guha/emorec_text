hi i'm simon Fisto from fist and,7.57,4.319
performance gearboxes today we're going,9.969,3.361
to drive three vehicles all fitted with,11.889,4.14
PPG gearboxes today's exercise is to,13.33,3.99
dispute the myth that a lot of people,16.029,2.791
believe you can't drive a dog box in a,17.32,4.41
street car and our own company vehicle,18.82,5.7
said a dog box in it for probably best,21.73,4.65
"part of four years now we've done 20,000",24.52,4.649
caves with it cars fine and most of its,26.38,5.07
application is used for street use let's,29.169,4.051
jump on the vehicles and show you how it,31.45,4.05
goes and my recommendation to most,33.22,4.65
people is your traffic lights you're,35.5,4.08
ready to get go put your foot on the,37.87,5.07
clutch count 1 2 3 in the gear 9 times,39.58,4.74
zero to 10 you won't even hear it go,42.94,3.0
inside fingers crossed,44.32,5.64
try it out 1 2 3 small come and we're,45.94,6.11
off,49.96,2.09
I've normally found that by the slower,52.94,5.07
you drive the slower you change gears as,55.339,4.171
you can see you will hear a little bit,58.01,4.349
of a clunk clunk or a bang that's,59.51,6.12
nothing to be concerned about and when,62.359,6.15
you start hearing like a lot of clunks,65.63,4.5
in a row like a machine gun going off or,68.509,2.97
something like that that's the dogs,70.13,3.05
bouncing over the top of each other and,71.479,5.25
that's when you incur the most potential,73.18,6.25
damage the slower you drive you know you,76.729,5.101
can change gears in a slow fashion my,79.43,3.78
recommendation to anyone who goes our,81.83,2.069
new gear box,83.21,2.24
my new dog box never driven one before,83.899,3.72
as you can see just roll over like a,85.45,3.97
normal car you know when you get it,87.619,4.741
right it's effortless you know we have,89.42,4.77
many customers whose girlfriends and,92.36,3.539
mothers drive around and once they,94.19,3.989
become accustomed to it and you know it,95.899,5.241
really doesn't take long,98.179,2.961
first gear second gear there was a,102.7,5.69
little bit of a clock that was just me,105.58,6.78
third fourth there you go 50 keys for,108.39,5.97
cruising down the road legal speed limit,112.36,4.77
no no one's the wiser it's a lot of,114.36,4.54
misconception people that people believe,117.13,3.18
are you know you've got to get in it and,118.9,3.23
you've got to drive it like you hate it,120.31,3.96
okay look maybe when you when you're,122.13,3.489
having a big guy when you're racing or,124.27,2.459
you're doing some club Sprint's or,125.619,3.36
something like that yes,126.729,3.75
driving around the street you don't as,128.979,3.51
you can see you'll see today driving,130.479,5.101
these three vehicles they're very simple,132.489,6.061
to drive very easy we put a lot of,135.58,4.59
effort a lot of design time into making,138.55,3.21
them easy to drive because we're aware,140.17,3.599
of a lot of our customers use them in a,141.76,4.5
street application as everyone's aware,143.769,6.411
you can flat shifting gear box,146.26,3.92
and as mentioned the faster you drive,151.8,3.6
the fast you should change and I will,153.51,5.07
sort up in the RPM a little bit and the,155.4,6.12
clutch was changing very simple very,158.58,4.26
easy all you need to do when you're,161.52,3.72
changing without the clutch just you're,162.84,4.08
in third gear for example you're on the,165.24,4.83
accelerator just a quick lift off the,166.92,4.86
accelerator put on the stick at the same,170.07,7.86
time Snickers I'll go back to third you,171.78,8.31
know overdoing not a lot 4000 rpm just,177.93,6.24
for example as you can see that's really,180.09,5.21
quite simple,184.17,4.41
I'll do it again actually with one,185.3,4.8
finger,188.58,4.41
there's not a lot of low it's only two,190.1,4.45
hands on the gears that you don't need,192.99,3.36
to break the gear stick off but a lot of,194.55,3.96
time a lot of effort into making the,196.35,5.97
thing usable for the everyday driver you,198.51,5.64
can drive to the track and do your club,202.32,3.36
days you can do your club Sprint's you,204.15,2.88
can impress Aliya mates with your dog,205.68,3.63
boxes and then you drive to work on,207.03,4.89
Monday so slowing down is heel and,209.31,4.97
target,211.92,2.36
as you can see no clamps no bangs,216.09,4.41
not doing big revs because we want to do,227.019,4.981
the right thing but it indicates you can,229.06,5.429
let shift them on a flat shifting as,232.0,3.84
such you do need to take the load off,234.489,5.911
the gearbox and we will soon as the,235.84,6.42
loads off it'll go into gear as quick as,240.4,4.199
you can get it into gear so yes you can,242.26,3.33
get on the website,244.599,4.53
PPG voxcom dot EU and you'll be able to,245.59,6.599
