Hi I'm Peter Lwin. Welcome to Blood Sugar Magic or BSM. Metformin is the most,0.26,7.24
"commonly used medication to help reduce
blood glucose in type 2 diabetes so if",7.5,5.73
you've recently been prescribed metformin or you're taking metformin at,13.23,3.18
"the moment you may find this series
useful.",16.41,3.07
In today's episode I'll talk about how metformin works in the body. The information provided is intended,19.64,7.44
"for Australian audiences only and is
general in nature. It does not a",27.09,4.08
"replace advice given to you by your health
care professional. Please read this",31.17,3.659
"disclaimer and the following terms and
conditions carefully before proceeding.",34.829,4.91
"Metformin can reduce the blood glucose
in three possible ways. Firstly it can",39.739,5.59
"improve the sensitivity to insulin in
the body. This in turn can reduce the",45.329,4.561
"insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is
when the cells in our body do not use",49.89,4.32
"insulin properly. These cells include our
muscle, liver and fat cells. Insulin is a",54.21,6.81
"hormone which is produced by the
pancreas. Insulin is like a key which",61.02,5.669
"unlocks the cells to allow the glucose
from the bloodstream to enter the cells",66.689,3.75
"to be used as fuel.  In insulin resistance
insulin has difficulty fitting into the",70.439,5.941
cells. This means more insulin keys are,76.38,2.61
"required than usual to open the locks. As
a result in the early stages of insulin",78.99,4.949
"resistance, the pancreas produces more
insulin. However eventually it cannot",83.939,6.271
"keep up and the glucose remains in the
blood instead of going into the cells.",90.21,5.24
"This results in higher blood glucose
levels.",95.45,4.059
Metformin helps the insulin keys fit into the cells more effectively so that glucose,99.509,4.89
"can enter the cells more efficiently.
This means there's glucose in the blood.",104.399,5.691
"Secondly metformin works on the liver.
When we are fasting, the liver rather",110.09,5.709
"than food, becomes our main source of
glucose. When the blood glucose becomes",115.799,4.11
"low, the liver produces glucose and
releases it into the bloodstream for our",119.909,4.53
"cells to use. This occurs for instance in
the early hours of the morning.",124.439,5.051
"However in type 2 diabetes, because of
insulin resistance, the liver produces",129.49,5.16
"more glucose than the body requires. This
causes a rise in blood glucose levels.",134.65,6.17
"Metformin prevents the liver from
producing more glucose than is needed.",140.82,5.37
"Metformin can delay the absorption of
glucose from the digestive system into",146.19,4.78
"the bloodstream. When we eat, the
carbohydrates and food get broken down",150.97,4.44
"into glucose by our digestive system. The
glucose is then absorbed into our",155.41,5.04
"bloodstream and taken to cells all over
the body to be used as fuel. After a meal",160.45,5.46
"our blood glucose rises. Metformin can
help to slow down the rise of blood glucose",165.91,4.5
"after meals so that it does not
peak as high or as quickly. Because of",170.41,5.43
"these three actions metformin helps
reduce the blood glucose levels.",175.84,5.52
"We hope you can join us for part three, which talks about common side effects and what",181.36,4.44
"can be done if they occur. Thank you for
watching Blood Sugar Magic BSM",185.8,6.95
