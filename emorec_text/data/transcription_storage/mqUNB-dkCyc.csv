my name is dr. Jenny Wiggly I'm a GP,3.65,4.93
working in the NHS and I specialize in,6.54,4.65
dermatology I'm here today to talk to,8.58,5.4
you about cellulitis cellulitis is an,11.19,6.48
infection of the skin normally it occurs,13.98,6.299
in the lower legs but it can also occur,17.67,5.13
in the arms as well sometimes it occurs,20.279,6.99
because an infected bite sometimes it,22.8,7.77
occurs because of a break in the skin so,27.269,5.761
people who are risk of cellulitis are,30.57,4.38
diabetics they have a reduced immune,33.03,3.93
system or any other person who has,34.95,4.679
reduced immune system actually so anemia,36.96,5.79
or iron deficiency on medication which,39.629,4.531
reduces the immune system such as,42.75,4.559
steroids so all those people are risk of,44.16,4.71
cellulitis just because they've got,47.309,3.09
reduced immune system so they can't,48.87,5.189
fight off any bugs that come in to come,50.399,4.5
into the skin,54.059,4.441
I'm also anyone who's got dry skin so,54.899,5.881
that also includes diabetics got dry,58.5,4.739
thick skin in the feet and the lower,60.78,3.8
part of the baek's,63.239,4.471
that will that actually means that the,64.58,5.71
skin barrier is weaker so allow us,67.71,5.88
usually staph aureus which is the bug,70.29,5.579
that gets into the skin and causes,73.59,6.51
infection so staph aureus is normally,75.869,6.781
colonized in the skin surface it doesn't,80.1,4.68
normally cause any harm about ten ten to,82.65,3.68
twenty percent of people are carriers,84.78,3.87
but it's just when it gets into the skin,86.33,4.06
where it's not meant to be that's when,88.65,4.109
it can cause problems so you do need to,90.39,4.47
be careful with hygiene keeping your,92.759,5.22
hands clean washing every day with soap,94.86,6.09
that sort of thing antiseptic lotions,97.979,7.491
and washers if you're at risk so,100.95,8.3
symptoms of cellulitis are redness pain,105.47,9.16
hot skin to touch swelling a very shiny,109.25,8.409
skin normally in the in the lower legs,114.63,6.66
or the hands or arms it can progress,117.659,4.621
quite quickly,121.29,3.18
matter of day see do you need to see,122.28,4.56
your GP especially few at risk and you,124.47,4.14
GP will then give you some antibiotics,126.84,3.419
usually something called flucloxacillin,128.61,4.02
which is penicillin base so if you're,130.259,3.361
allergic to that they'll give you,132.63,3.36
something else instead and if that,133.62,5.28
doesn't help then you might need to go,135.99,5.04
up to the hospital for intravenous,138.9,4.98
antibiotics but it is a condition,141.03,5.28
whereby if you are worried about it you,143.88,5.16
must see your GP as soon as possible so,146.31,4.53
I hope this has been useful and thank,149.04,4.669
you for listening to me,150.84,2.869
