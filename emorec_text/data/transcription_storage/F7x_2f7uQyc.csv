hi this is dr. Mark Hyman welcome to my,3.41,4.63
weekly house call your chance to ask me,6.24,4.529
your questions and this week's question,8.04,4.35
is hey dr. Hyman I know you're not big,10.769,3.901
on sugar and you tell people to cut down,12.39,4.17
on sugar consumption but how about,14.67,3.449
artificial sweeteners are they okay to,16.56,3.57
drink and eat and should I use those,18.119,5.79
instead well sadly the answer is a big,20.13,6.989
fat no and here's the reason there's,23.909,5.79
been mounds of research that artificial,27.119,4.56
sweeteners both in human studies animal,29.699,4.081
studies experimental studies population,31.679,4.831
studies is bad news so let me share with,33.78,4.29
you what's going on first they've been,36.51,2.97
linked to obesity there's been a,38.07,3.57
dramatic increase in obesity with the,39.48,3.78
use of artificial sweeteners one study,41.64,4.289
of 400 people found that their belly,43.26,5.579
size no the middle increased by five,45.929,5.88
times for those who drink two diet sodas,48.839,5.61
a day it also increases the risk of,51.809,6.061
obesity and weight gain dramatically and,54.449,4.921
even increase the risk of diabetes one,57.87,4.23
"large study of 66,000 women in Europe",59.37,5.4
found that those who had won the tie so,62.1,5.31
today increased their risk by 33 percent,64.77,5.13
and if you add to your risk went up of,67.41,6.09
66 percent to get diabetes that's very,69.9,6.93
significant so number one it makes you,73.5,6.39
fat number two it does it by rewiring,76.83,5.64
and screwing up your brain chemistry and,79.89,4.95
your metabolism so what happens when you,82.47,3.51
have an artificial sweetener,84.84,3.09
well they stimulate your taste buds and,85.98,3.36
there are thousand times sweeter than,87.93,3.54
regular sugar and they promote this,89.34,5.4
response in the body that confuses it it,91.47,5.13
makes it think sugars on the way but,94.74,3.78
it's not really coming and what's going,96.6,4.08
on and a whole series of things happen,98.52,4.62
they're really bad one it slows your,100.68,5.46
metabolism down so you literally slow,103.14,4.26
your metabolism slow your body,106.14,2.28
temperature they've done this in,107.4,3.69
experiments and rats too you get super,108.42,5.13
hungry so humans and animals fed,111.09,4.65
artificial sweeteners eat way more food,113.55,4.38
and way more sugar and way more carbs,115.74,3.99
just because they're over stimulated by,117.93,3.87
the sugar and it makes them hungry and,119.73,4.95
three it actually makes them gain weight,121.8,6.36
in some studies the rats put on 14% more,124.68,6.69
body fat than the rats eating regular,128.16,5.85
sugar even though the people who,131.37,4.289
the rats aiding Regan on people the rats,134.01,5.49
eating regular sugar had more food and,135.659,5.761
more calories that's really crazy right,139.5,4.26
so it slows metabolism and slows your,141.42,4.5
body temperature it makes you hungry and,143.76,4.199
it causes you to store body fat that's,145.92,6.539
bad news so things like aspartame and,147.959,8.221
NutraSweet and Splenda a sucralose and,152.459,6.571
and all the sugar alcohols and the,156.18,5.339
stevia's and the natural sweeteners all,159.03,3.87
of them are kind of the same stevia,161.519,2.58
might be a little bit better and a,162.9,3.479
little bit of it I'm okay with but it's,164.099,4.591
not like it's always unlimited and I,166.379,3.42
really encourage people to think about,168.69,3.18
the problem and the third thing that's,169.799,4.321
really scary is that artificial,171.87,5.88
sweeteners are highly addictive in one,174.12,5.22
study they did of rats they gave them,177.75,4.62
cocaine and that was IB cocaine or they,179.34,4.35
gave them artificial sweeteners and they,182.37,3.089
could pick which other one and they,183.69,3.96
always went for the artificial sugar,185.459,4.261
they always went for in fact they work,187.65,4.559
eight times harder to get the artificial,189.72,3.87
sweeteners than they did the cocaine and,192.209,2.791
if they were already addicted to cocaine,193.59,3.239
guess what they went for the artificial,195.0,4.2
sweeteners so it completely screws up,196.829,4.081
your capacity to regulate your food,199.2,3.81
intake makes you hungry addicted and,200.91,5.189
it's bad news so there's no reason to,203.01,4.92
consume artificial sweeteners at all if,206.099,3.51
you like sugar and you want to have a,207.93,4.709
little bit fine great put a teaspoon of,209.609,5.071
sugar in your coffee I mean you wouldn't,212.639,4.561
have a soda which has 15 teaspoons of,214.68,4.5
sugar and you wouldn't put 15 teaspoons,217.2,4.11
of sugar in your coffee so you know eat,219.18,5.52
real food have sweet things but don't,221.31,5.16
have pharmacologic dose of sugar the,224.7,3.539
problem isn't a little bit of sugar we,226.47,3.389
put our coffee or a little bit of,228.239,3.12
dessert we have that's not the problem,229.859,3.71
it's the sugar that's added to our food,231.359,4.591
80% of processed foods have added sugar,233.569,4.6
including things like ketchup and salad,235.95,4.17
dressing and tomato sauce I mean your,238.169,5.371
prego tomato sauce has more sugar in a,240.12,5.67
serving of tomato sauce than two Oreo,243.54,5.279
cookies one Yoplait yogurt which is like,245.79,6.27
a breakfast yogurt has more sugar than a,248.819,6.121
can of coke it's frightening so it's not,252.06,5.1
breakfast it's dessert so you really,254.94,3.69
don't want to have processed foods with,257.16,2.759
added sugar you want to have real food,258.63,3.359
so you want every Oh food don't eat,259.919,3.691
artificial sweeteners with it eat real,261.989,4.561
food had sugar to your food but it's not,263.61,3.96
the sugar that,266.55,2.37
you had that's a problem it's a sugar,267.57,3.36
that's added that's the key not the,268.92,3.75
hundred and fifty two pounds of sugar,270.93,3.51
that's added to our diet every day,272.67,3.66
I mean every year by the by the food,274.44,3.48
industry it's just what you add that's,276.33,3.45
okay so think if sugar is a recreational,277.92,3.45
drug right it's something you would,279.78,3.24
enjoy from time to time it's like you,281.37,3.48
have a glass of wine or a glass of,283.02,4.38
tequila but you wouldn't have tequila,284.85,4.8
for breakfast lunch and dinner or wine,287.4,3.81
from well some people do but he wouldn't,289.65,2.73
have wine for breakfast lunch and dinner,291.21,3.15
you and use it as a recreational,292.38,3.3
substance that you know it's powerful,294.36,3.15
you know it's strong and you have it in,295.68,4.35
limited amounts same for sugar so if you,297.51,4.29
want to stay healthy if you want to lose,300.03,3.51
weight if you want to avoid diabetes if,301.8,3.48
you want to reduce your food intake,303.54,5.25
overall eat real sugar in moderation,305.28,5.97
like a recreational drug and stay away,308.79,4.56
from artificial sweeteners completely,311.25,3.81
now if you want to have a little stevia,313.35,4.47
okay but little is the operative word,315.06,4.44
