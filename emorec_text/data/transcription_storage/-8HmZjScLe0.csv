"- With the feeding tube
my nutrition going,",0.448,1.673
I don't have to worry about it.,2.121,1.115
"But now I'm starting to
really feel the effects",3.236,1.972
of not getting proper nutrition.,5.208,1.549
"I'm sorry, ya'll.",6.757,1.575
"Till I can get adequate nutrition again,",8.332,4.052
I'm gonna take a break from the vlogs.,12.384,2.004
(upbeat music playing),14.388,3.25
Going on an adventure.,27.58,1.247
- It got physical there.,28.827,2.0
(laughter),32.072,2.25
"- Good Friday morning, everyone.",39.888,2.667
I felt the lack of nutrition this morning,43.813,3.417
when I woke up.,49.17,1.25
I just feel not so great.,51.613,2.083
"But the good news is, I have what I need",56.145,3.333
to help hold me over until Monday.,63.123,2.833
Kate Farms amazingly overnighted,67.554,2.114
"the oral nutritional
supplemental drink to me,",69.668,4.219
so I got that this morning.,73.887,2.068
"And later today I'll
be getting my delivery",75.955,3.445
"for my usual infusion
and port care supplies",79.4,3.831
"including the extra
fluids for this weekend.",83.231,3.388
I am infusing now.,86.619,1.5
And I'm just taking it easy.,91.308,1.68
"I'm doing my best not
to expend any energy,",92.988,2.857
so I'm just doing the best I can.,95.845,2.75
"So here's everything that's
gonna help hold me over",101.942,2.811
"until Monday when we can
replace my feeding tube.",104.753,3.592
"Got the oral nutritional
shakes from Kate Farms,",108.345,2.701
"my fluids, and the ambulatory
pump to infuse the fluids.",111.046,4.167
"This is a banana bag
with the extra nutrients,",116.131,2.955
electrolytes and what not.,119.086,2.208
In no way does this replicate what my,121.294,2.279
feeding tube formula does for me.,123.573,2.653
And I am probably gonna get a bit worse,126.226,2.415
before things get better.,128.641,2.0
"But at the very least,
all of this will help.",130.641,4.155
"I am really thankful Kate
Farms sent this to me",134.796,2.28
on such short notice.,137.076,1.359
They overnighted it to me,138.435,1.294
so I could have it through the weekend.,139.729,2.282
"And this can be used for
feeding tube formula.",142.011,4.248
"I know people who do use
it for their feeding tube.",146.259,3.107
We use their other formula because,149.366,2.699
it's higher in caloric value,152.065,2.188
and its properties are more broken down,154.253,2.793
so it's easier for my body to absorb.,157.046,2.507
"But this is gonna be a good
solution for me to sip on",159.553,3.251
'cause it's really nutritious.,162.804,1.403
And I put the others in the fridge,164.207,1.947
"since I prefer them to be chilled,",166.154,1.633
but I am going to try this one right now.,167.787,2.971
I got the chocolate-flavored.,170.758,2.417
"I'm gonna try it right now
'cause I haven't tried it yet.",174.166,2.807
So I just shook this up.,176.973,2.0
It actually tastes really good.,182.483,2.305
Awesome.,184.788,0.99
"So I cannot do a lot of volume,",185.778,2.583
"but at least the few sips I
do manage throughout the day",189.478,2.995
will be really nutritious.,192.473,1.621
And that's good.,194.094,1.495
When I have my feeding tube and,195.589,1.436
"I'm getting proper nutrition,",197.025,1.818
"I still do take a few
bites of various foods",198.843,2.505
"throughout the day, but since I don't",201.348,1.879
"have my nutrition running,",203.227,1.643
"I have to make what I intake
orally now really count,",204.87,3.083
so I'm only gonna be intaking,207.953,2.178
the Kate Farms nutritional shake.,210.131,2.75
"And gosh, the feeding tube
takes away so much stress.",214.219,4.167
"I can feel myself becoming
a bit emotional because",219.406,4.167
"with the feeding tube
and my nutrition going,",224.856,2.31
"I don't have to worry about it,",227.166,1.432
"but now I'm starting to
really feel the effects",228.598,1.966
of not getting enough proper nutrition.,230.564,2.122
"And I'm feeling terrible so
I want to make myself eat,",232.686,2.27
"but I have to be careful
not to give myself too much",234.956,2.373
because then I'll vomit.,237.329,2.219
But I'm not getting enough.,239.548,2.25
And it's like a vicious cycle.,243.077,1.838
"And it's stressful,",244.915,1.098
"but I am so thankful that
this will be over on Monday.",246.013,4.167
"I'm sorry, ya'll.",258.606,2.159
I can't do this.,260.765,1.573
I feel terrible.,262.338,1.333
"So I'm gonna take a
short break from vlogging",265.19,3.208
until I get my feeding tube exchanged.,268.398,2.568
"I will upload this video because
if I stop without warning,",270.966,4.002
"I know some of ya'll would worry,",274.968,1.694
"and with the connection we have,",276.662,1.526
I don't want to worry anyone.,278.188,2.314
"But until I can get
adequate nutrition again,",280.502,4.25
I'm gonna take a break from the vlogs.,284.752,2.569
Please try not to worry too much.,287.321,2.425
"Just because I'm taking
a break doesn't mean",289.746,1.71
I'm an emergency situation.,291.456,3.067
"I have been much worse
off with my gastroparesis.",294.523,4.083
If ya'll remember how I was before,300.244,3.403
"I got my feeding tube
initially, that was scary.",303.647,4.293
"Right now I'm just feeling
very weak and run down,",307.94,3.593
"lethargic, having to use my walker more,",311.533,3.082
"and just getting out of
bed, getting dressed,",314.615,2.939
"taking Harlow out and feeding her,",317.554,3.056
that took everything I had.,320.61,2.25
All the energy.,324.292,1.651
And I'm taking a break because,325.943,2.353
"I just don't have the
energy to like vlog and edit",328.296,3.764
"and upload, and all that, but also,",332.06,2.101
"this weekend, I'm just gonna
be staying in bed and sleeping,",334.161,3.896
so there's not much to vlog anyway.,338.057,2.016
"And my mom will be here
all weekend to help me.",340.073,3.683
"Even though Judd's not back yet,",343.756,1.245
I will have some support here.,345.001,2.312
"And Harlow, of course.",347.313,1.676
"Right now I am just
feeling extremely worn out,",348.989,3.235
and I'm relying on my walker more.,352.224,3.302
I'm feeling weak.,355.526,1.932
"I mean, imagine just not being able to eat",357.458,2.63
since Monday night.,360.088,1.583
It's not easy.,364.156,1.167
"And I am hanging in there,",367.525,1.231
but this just really grows my appreciation,368.756,3.043
for my feeding tube.,371.799,1.667
"The tube takes away a
lot of stress surrounding",374.475,3.135
"my gastroparesis, itself,",377.61,2.501
and a lot of stress surrounding food.,380.111,2.428
It's not that I choose not to eat.,382.539,2.58
That's not it at all.,385.119,1.373
I love eating.,386.492,1.414
I'm a human being.,387.906,0.833
I love the taste of food.,388.739,1.207
I just physically cannot.,389.946,2.757
My stomach is partially paralyzed.,392.703,1.872
"It cannot digest food,",394.575,1.528
"and if I force-feed myself, I'll vomit.",396.103,3.353
And I hate vomiting.,399.456,1.554
"I'm grateful for the fact
that usually I am able to take",401.01,3.707
"a few bites of various
foods throughout the day.",404.717,3.535
"On bad days, I can't eat at all.",408.252,2.174
"On good days, I can manage
a couple hundred calories.",410.426,3.372
"But it's definitely not
enough to sustain myself",413.798,3.869
on oral intake alone.,417.667,1.765
"And that's where the
feeding tube comes in.",419.432,2.947
I used to be so stressed out about food,422.379,3.25
"leading right up to when I first
got my feeding tube placed.",427.956,3.287
"If ya'll remember that
time, it was pretty scary.",431.243,3.857
"I knew I needed to eat,",435.1,1.917
"but I knew eating was gonna
cause horrible symptoms,",439.086,3.311
"stomach pain, bloating
like you wouldn't believe.",442.397,2.357
When was I gonna hit that boundary,444.754,3.108
where I would eat too much and puke?,447.862,3.779
"And it was terrible, and
the worst part of it all was",451.641,3.711
even though I was doing my very best,455.352,2.75
"and forcing myself to
eat as much as I could,",458.102,3.775
I was still losing weight.,461.877,1.915
"I was still becoming
horribly malnourished.",463.792,2.63
"And I think why I'm becoming
a bit emotional right now",466.422,3.785
"is even though I know, logically,",470.207,3.565
"I'm going to start
getting better on Monday,",473.772,2.638
"my body knows that it's
going back into that state.",476.41,3.641
And it's just very stressful.,480.051,2.208
"Obviously that severe
malnourishment happened",482.259,2.906
"over the course of a long time,",485.165,2.851
"so going just under a week
without feeds is doable,",488.016,4.167
and I'll be okay.,493.043,1.676
"It's just a realization
of how grateful I am",494.719,3.667
"for the feeding tube,
how much it helps me,",500.901,1.84
"how much stress it takes away
because I don't have to worry",502.741,2.714
"about force-feeding myself
and getting enough calories.",505.455,3.525
"It bypasses my stomach and
goes to my small intestine.",508.98,3.868
"Small intestine's proven
to be great at digestion,",512.848,2.987
and I can feel strong and nourished,515.835,2.791
"and get everything I
need from my feeding tube",518.626,2.135
and then that frees me up to eat orally,520.761,3.458
only when I feel capable.,524.219,2.298
"You know, I don't have to
sit down at the table and",526.517,3.298
"force-feed myself if I know
it's going to make me feel sick.",529.815,3.218
"Instead, I can just take
a few bites here and there",533.033,3.315
when it best suits me.,536.348,2.29
"I know I need to continue eating
orally because if I don't,",538.638,4.361
"I could lose what little
function my stomach has left.",542.999,3.766
"But so much stress is
gone with my feeding tube.",546.765,4.0
"Again, it doesn't fix everything.",552.36,2.843
"It's not a perfect answer,",555.203,2.703
but it's the best tool we've found,557.906,2.333
to help manage my gastroparesis.,560.239,2.904
"And you know, I was
feeling a little saddened",563.143,2.381
"earlier because I was telling myself,",565.524,2.084
"""On Monday things will get better.",567.608,1.958
"""On Monday things will get better.""",569.566,1.381
And the reality is there are so many,570.947,3.036
"other GP Warriors out there,",573.983,2.36
"and things are not
getting better for them.",576.343,2.96
"I know GP effects everybody differently,",579.303,3.754
"but at the same time,",583.057,1.75
"I know of people who are
still struggling with symptoms",586.273,4.003
"even though they have tried
every possible treatment.",590.276,3.532
I know people who have not yet,593.808,2.896
"been able to find a knowledgeable doctor,",596.704,2.66
and their GP is not well-controlled.,599.364,2.7
There are people out there right now,602.064,2.027
"who are probably struggling
with gastroparesis",604.091,2.557
and don't even know it because,606.648,2.254
it's not a very well-known disorder.,608.902,2.444
I was one of those people,611.346,1.35
who had no idea what gastroparesis was,612.696,3.167
until I started the diagnosis process.,616.879,3.167
"But this is why I share my story,",621.136,2.235
"to hopefully spread awareness,",623.371,1.943
to hopefully let other Warriors know,625.314,2.38
they are not alone in their battle.,627.694,1.951
"And together, maybe we can
foster some more understanding",629.645,4.167
"for invisible illnesses in our community,",634.689,2.729
to break the stigmas that are out there.,637.418,2.289
"And so I just want to
say thank you to ya'll",639.707,4.099
for being so understanding and helpful,643.806,3.004
and loving and supportive in this time.,646.81,2.918
"And, again, I will be okay until Monday.",649.728,3.758
I just really need to take a break,653.486,1.749
'cause I'm not feeling it.,655.235,1.749
"I told myself that if
vlogging ever becomes a chore,",656.984,3.933
"rather than a passion, I
need to take a step back.",660.917,4.89
"And it's not feeling like
a chore per se right now,",665.807,3.961
"it's just becoming too
physically demanding.",669.768,2.614
"Like, right now I need to
take full focus on my body",672.382,3.227
and I'm literally just going to lay in bed,675.609,2.47
and sleep the whole weekend.,678.079,1.495
"And, again, my mom will be here",679.574,1.741
"the whole weekend to help me,",681.315,1.195
"so there's just not gonna
be much to vlog anyways.",682.51,3.031
"And I promise as soon as I'm able,",685.541,1.977
"I will pick up the camera
and continue vlogging.",687.518,3.758
I will give updates on Instagram.,691.276,2.195
There we go.,693.471,1.115
"That's a good, I don't
know what the word is,",694.586,3.117
but oh a good compromise.,697.703,2.322
"So no vlogs, but there's a link to my",700.025,2.138
"Instagram in the description,
and I will post there.",702.163,2.932
"And, again, thank you.",705.095,1.599
Ya'll are why I do what I do.,706.694,2.287
"You are the ones who
help me share my story",708.981,2.88
and spread awareness and let others know,711.861,1.906
they're not alone in their fight.,713.767,1.152
"So with much love, I will say good-bye,",714.919,3.451
and I will see you next time.,718.37,1.481
