hey guys I had a recent question related,0.03,4.559
to monk fruit and stevia and riether,2.34,4.32
tall and xylitol which one's the best,4.589,4.081
which ones there were so let's just talk,6.66,5.04
about these four sweeteners monk fruit,8.67,6.509
and stevia and recruit all all have a,11.7,7.079
zero glycemic index so they will not,15.179,5.36
increase insulin okay,18.779,5.58
xylitol on the glycemic index is thirty,20.539,6.101
so it's low but it's still a little,24.359,5.49
spike if you consume this one in small,26.64,6.0
amounts it should not be a problem now I,29.849,6.511
do use xylitol for a lot of different,32.64,7.23
recipes simply because it really tastes,36.36,5.31
just like sugar okay,39.87,3.959
stevia has a little bit of an aftertaste,41.67,4.67
but this is really good in things like,43.829,4.98
like flavoring water and carbonated,46.34,4.69
water to make like a soda and it's good,48.809,5.011
in certain recipes monk fruit also has a,51.03,5.189
slight little aftertaste it's really,53.82,3.69
really sweet so you don't need much of,56.219,3.48
it but both of these are very similar,57.51,4.17
there they kind of give a little bit of,59.699,3.961
an aftertaste they don't really taste a,61.68,3.629
hundred percent like sugar but they're,63.66,3.36
good in certain recipes but not in,65.309,4.231
others I don't really use this one as,67.02,5.49
much I use stevia a little bit more now,69.54,5.64
riether tall doesn't have the aftertaste,72.51,4.77
but it definitely does not taste like,75.18,5.549
xylitol it has more of a cold taste a,77.28,6.54
cold sweet taste but I still use this in,80.729,5.101
recipes because it's great to combine,83.82,5.4
this maybe with this or these two,85.83,5.969
together and to have the the right,89.22,5.55
balance now the other point about the,91.799,4.261
wreath throat roll is sometimes it's,94.77,3.93
made from corn which is GMO so you want,96.06,7.29
to make sure this one is non-gmo okay,98.7,7.169
same thing with xylitol this you want,103.35,6.449
this from birch bark and non-gmo and if,105.869,5.761
you're actually chewing gum,109.799,4.441
make sure it's xylitol gum and don't,111.63,4.23
worry about it interfering with your,114.24,3.21
intermittent fasting it's not going to,115.86,3.6
bump you out of ketosis it's such a,117.45,4.26
small amount that gum that you don't,119.46,4.11
want to consume is the gum with,121.71,4.38
aspartame you want to avoid these,123.57,5.13
artificial sweeteners these are sugar,126.09,5.7
alcohols and this is a fruit and this is,128.7,4.53
from a plant,131.79,3.51
these are totally fine there's a lot of,133.23,4.11
other sugar alcohols and natural,135.3,3.689
sweeteners that you can do but these are,137.34,4.08
the common ones right here between these,138.989,5.521
two I found this one tends to give,141.42,6.539
people a little more digestive problem,144.51,6.27
it consumed in larger amounts this one,147.959,5.28
can be as well but if you're having,150.78,3.929
small amounts it doesn't seem to be a,153.239,3.631
problem but when you start making these,154.709,5.131
keto bombs or these recipes but it just,156.87,4.35
tastes so good you want to eat a lot of,159.84,3.06
it well then you'll start getting some,161.22,3.21
problems because they can act as a,162.9,4.679
laxative or give you gas and sometimes,164.43,4.529
you'll hear this idea that if you,167.579,3.24
consume anything sweet whether it's monk,168.959,4.081
fruit or stevia even know it's zero,170.819,4.5
calories it's still gonna spike insulin,173.04,4.83
i've never had a problem with that i,175.319,4.381
never see a problem with that i wouldn't,177.87,5.04
