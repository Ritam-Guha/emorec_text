peripheral neuropathy is a painful,12.719,6.091
condition which affects the extremities,16.08,5.16
it is a type of nerve pain or,18.81,4.65
neuropathic pain where there's damage,21.24,4.44
and/or dysfunction to an element to the,23.46,4.25
nervous system which leads to,25.68,4.95
hypersensitivity how does that translate,27.71,5.939
well patients will come along and,30.63,5.58
generally speaking the peripheral,33.649,5.081
neuropathy will be in their feet feet,36.21,5.57
and ankles and patients will describe,38.73,6.62
nerve type pain so they may have burning,41.78,8.049
sharp lancinating really unpleasant,45.35,7.419
types of pain electric shock like pains,49.829,5.0
that sort of thing,52.769,5.851
when you assess the patient's we need to,54.829,6.49
find out is there an obvious cause for,58.62,5.189
their peripheral neuropathy the major,61.319,4.861
things we're looking for in a patient's,63.809,6.031
history are of a diabetic is one of the,66.18,6.119
number-one ones and actually sometimes,69.84,5.34
diabetes presents with peripheral,72.299,5.751
neuropathy so it needs to be excluded,75.18,5.97
does the patient have a vitamin,78.05,5.65
deficiency a b12 deficiency is quite,81.15,5.16
common are there any other causes for,83.7,5.34
the neuropathy if they had trauma to the,86.31,6.15
feet surgery that sort of thing or do,89.04,5.43
they have vascular insufficiency is,92.46,5.61
another significant cause it's a very,94.47,9.93
painful unpleasant complaint and once,98.07,9.69
we've assessed the patient we will do a,104.4,7.56
full history and examination the history,107.76,5.94
will consist of a pain questionnaire,111.96,4.17
which we send out and we look at the,113.7,4.62
characteristics of the pain site,116.13,4.5
character duration radiation aggravating,118.32,4.71
relieving associated factors we'll look,120.63,3.9
at the previous treatments that the,123.03,4.62
patient has had and any investigations,124.53,6.89
that they've had and then we can assess,127.65,7.29
the condition as fully as possible now,131.42,5.91
it's very important when patients have,134.94,5.7
peripheral neuropathy to find out if,137.33,6.489
there is an underlying cause to that as,140.64,5.54
we've previously discussed,143.819,4.51
that's will usually require further,146.18,5.009
investigations usually blood tests or,148.329,5.351
radiological investigations such as MRI,151.189,6.091
scans to find out is there an underlying,153.68,7.009
cause because that needs to be tackled,157.28,8.28
first then we will move on to how do we,160.689,7.651
actually improve this patient symptoms,165.56,5.31
when we're dealing with peripheral,168.34,5.2
neuropathy as I mentioned before it is a,170.87,5.3
type of neuropathic pain or nerve pain,173.54,6.27
the mainstay of treatment for all types,176.17,6.789
of neuropathic pain is medication and,179.81,5.66
the medications that we use are called,182.959,6.271
anti neuropathic medications they all,185.47,6.07
tend to have started off life treating,189.23,4.229
other things so we use anti-epileptics,191.54,4.02
we use antidepressants we use,193.459,5.61
anti-arrhythmic medications and the,195.56,7.2
general principle is to use small,199.069,5.911
amounts of the medication to slowly,202.76,6.02
escalate the dose and to balance,204.98,7.649
benefits in terms of pain relief with,208.78,6.789
any side effects that the patient may,212.629,8.28
experience always always optimizing,215.569,7.441
medication is the most important,220.909,5.64
treatment option we do have other,223.01,6.3
treatment options beyond that for,226.549,5.671
example we can do pulsed radio frequency,229.31,5.19
treatment which I will speak about in,232.22,5.759
another video we also have advanced pain,234.5,5.97
management treatments and we can offer,237.979,5.79
spinal cord stimulation and dorsal root,240.47,5.729
ganglion stimulation now these are,243.769,4.731
advanced treatments and these are only,246.199,6.0
suggesting once all the usual treatment,248.5,7.599
options have been explored the other,252.199,5.76
thing that we do with patients with,256.099,4.89
peripheral neuropathy firstly we need to,257.959,5.311
break the cycle of the pain improve the,260.989,4.291
pain and get the symptoms under control,263.27,5.04
as much as possible but we do need to,265.28,6.03
rehabilitate the patient as well and,268.31,5.3
that will be physical rehabilitation,271.31,4.409
usually under the care of one of our,273.61,4.69
pain physiotherapists and that Willing,275.719,3.371
in Kali,278.3,2.92
dude strengthening training aerobic,279.09,5.34
training but also forward peripheral,281.22,6.14
neuropathy we teach desensitization,284.43,5.519
exercises now these are external,287.36,5.71
physical treatments which the patient,289.949,6.03
can do themselves on a daily basis and,293.07,5.46
they're there to try and retrain the,295.979,5.131
skin and to try and help reduce the,298.53,6.32
overall pain levels,301.11,3.74
