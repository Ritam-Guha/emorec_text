- This is Tomasz Biernacki,",3.39,1.61
"and this is the quick video
on diabetic foot ulcers.",5.0,2.6
"What causes them? How
to take care of them?",7.6,2.21
What your podiatrist can do for you?,9.81,1.71
Is it worth going to see a podiatrist?,11.52,1.689
Spoiler alert. Yes!,13.209,1.861
And we're starting right now.,15.07,1.172
(upbeat music),16.242,2.583
"Guys, thank you so much
for watching this video.",20.653,2.417
"We appreciate your likes,
your subscribes, your comment.",23.07,2.81
"We really love hearing
if this stuff helps.",25.88,2.16
It really makes a big difference for us.,28.04,1.71
"So thank you.
(mouse clicks)",29.75,1.09
What causes diabetic foot ulcers?,30.84,2.13
Number one is diabetes for a long time,32.97,3.1
that's not controlled.,36.07,1.172
"This leads to lack of sensation
on the bottom of your foot.",37.242,3.128
So what happens is,40.37,1.53
"you're putting so much
pressure on your toes.",41.9,2.56
"Your shoes can be squeezing
the front of your foot.",44.46,2.83
"It can be causing rubbing, blisters,",47.29,2.48
and you're not feeling it.,49.77,1.41
"The problem is you think you feel it,",51.18,2.17
but you don't feel it as a diabetic.,53.35,2.67
Problem number two is blood flow.,56.02,1.91
"As a diabetic,",57.93,0.97
"as you have diabetes for a long time,",58.9,2.07
your blood vessels narrow.,60.97,2.07
You're not getting as much blood flow,63.04,1.8
as when you were a teenager.,64.84,1.13
You're not healing as quickly.,65.97,1.69
"When little kids get a cut,",67.66,1.41
"they heal it like that.
(fingers snap)",69.07,1.46
"When adults get a cut, it
takes months and months.",70.53,3.48
"I have some people that it
can take them six months",74.01,2.69
"to heal a wound that a
little kid would heal",76.7,2.52
in maybe a week or less.,79.22,1.34
"Maybe that's an exaggeration,
but it feels like that.",80.56,2.31
Number three is pressure.,82.87,1.46
"Listen, when you're a teenager
who doesn't have diabetes,",84.33,3.08
you're usually pretty light.,87.41,1.37
"People who are diabetics
and have foot wounds",88.78,2.13
are usually pretty heavy.,90.91,2.06
They usually don't wear the best shoes.,92.97,1.93
"They usually don't like wearing shoes,",94.9,1.36
"and they usually don't
have normal-shaped feet.",96.26,3.19
They don't have flexibility.,99.45,1.38
"That causes a lot of pressure
every time they step,",100.83,2.96
"bruising, pounding.",103.79,1.429
Their toes are rubbing.,105.219,1.921
"That's the third part of the
triangle, is lack of sensation,",107.14,4.78
"poor blood flow, and high pressure.",111.92,2.03
And number four is an injury.,113.95,1.72
Sometimes something hits you.,115.67,1.23
"Sometimes a car runs you over,",116.9,1.368
but that's not the most common cause.,118.268,2.452
"But sometimes, that's what
makes people come into the ER,",120.72,3.41
and that's what they blame.,124.13,1.03
But it's usually those first three,125.16,1.57
that cause the problem to start.,126.73,1.677
So what's the problem with an ulcer?,128.407,2.053
"If you have an ulcer for long enough,",130.46,1.48
it's gonna give you an infection.,131.94,1.67
"You're gonna end up in the hospital,",133.61,1.56
"and eventually, it ends up in your bone,",135.17,1.69
"and eventually, you could lose your toe,",136.86,2.23
"the front of your foot, or your leg.",139.09,2.28
Don't wait.,141.37,0.833
"Come see your podiatrist
and check the forms below",142.203,2.807
if you're in Southern Michigan.,145.01,1.75
When do you come see a podiatrist?,146.76,2.13
What we would do is take your blood work.,148.89,1.58
How's your blood sugar?,150.47,0.833
What are your health conditions like?,151.303,1.787
What can we fix easily?,153.09,2.07
"What does your x-ray look
like? Are you wearing shoes?",155.16,2.25
"Do you have diabetic shoes?
Do you need a CT scan?",157.41,2.85
Do you need an MRI?,160.26,1.15
"Can we get you an
ultrasound in the office?",161.41,2.24
It's all about that workup and history.,163.65,2.31
"There's usually very correctable things,",165.96,2.15
and we need to address the risk factors.,168.11,2.52
"And we also work in our office
with a vascular specialist",170.63,3.52
"who can schedule you for an
evaluation of the blood vessels",174.15,3.81
and potentially correct those.,177.96,1.39
So you get better blood flow.,179.35,1.39
You get pressure off there.,180.74,1.23
You're already getting healthier.,181.97,1.37
You're losing weight. That's the trick.,183.34,2.4
That's how you get rid of your foot ulcer,185.74,1.59
with your podiatrist.,187.33,1.09
So another thing we do is offloading.,188.42,2.28
"If you have a wound, you
have to clean up the wound.",190.7,3.63
You have to put a nice addressing on it.,194.33,1.64
"You have to evaluate it, and measure it,",195.97,1.72
"and make sure the risk
factors are taken care of.",197.69,2.04
"But a boot like this, look it.",199.73,1.68
It holds your ankle.,201.41,1.01
It takes pressure off your heel.,202.42,1.18
"It takes pressure off
the front of your foot.",203.6,1.83
"It has a rocker bottom
so that you can walk.",205.43,2.97
"Sometimes you need a scooter.
Sometimes you need a walker;",208.4,3.79
sometimes you need to be in the hospital,212.19,1.8
and a nursing home for a little bit,213.99,1.13
"if you can't move, if
you have back problems,",215.12,1.67
hip problems.,216.79,0.86
"For a lot of people,",217.65,1.06
"if they can't fit in the
boot, I will make a cast.",218.71,2.876
"And what happens is it's
a total contact cast.",221.586,3.094
"If you have pressure, so a wound,",224.68,1.85
"I will make a donut around it,
then put padding everywhere",226.53,3.27
except for that wound.,229.8,1.44
"So that lets people walk
in this total contact cast",231.24,3.04
with very little pressure on that wound,234.28,2.61
so that the wound can heal.,236.89,1.46
They can move around.,238.35,0.833
"The tough part is it's
hard taking a shower.",239.183,1.507
"It's hard changing your extra tight pants,",240.69,2.2
"like your skinny jeans,
but it can save your leg.",242.89,3.474
"Seek care if you're red, hot, painful.",246.364,3.216
"If you have pus coming
out of there, if it's red,",249.58,1.94
"if your leg looks like a balloon,",251.52,1.57
"if you feel like you're
gonna vomit, go to the ER.",253.09,3.03
"And when you go to the ER,",256.12,1.32
"usually they call a podiatrist
like myself at my hospital,",257.44,3.43
"at the very least, where we evaluate it,",260.87,2.23
we can clean it out.,263.1,1.05
We make sure it's not in the bone.,264.15,1.41
"If it is in the bone,",265.56,1.29
"we can take a sample of the
bone or clean up the bone",266.85,3.36
and save the rest of the foot.,270.21,2.35
"And that's what needs to
be done in some cases.",272.56,2.14
"The longer you wait, the worse
the treatment usually is.",274.7,4.28
"So come in early,",278.98,1.07
call your podiatrist early.,280.05,1.79
"If you're in Michigan,",281.84,1.21
let us come see you.,283.05,1.64
We have a lot of options.,284.69,1.51
"There's a lot of great
podiatrists everywhere.",286.2,2.04
"willing to help people with
their diabetic foot wounds.",288.24,2.11
"So the longer you wait,
the more risk you take.",290.35,2.43
"Stuff to do at home,",292.78,1.05
"you gotta be careful, but always
check your feet every day.",293.83,3.07
"Wear good shoes, good fitting shoes.",296.9,2.59
"Use a mirror if you can't
see the bottom of your foot.",299.49,2.13
"Check between your toes,
anything open, anything red.",301.62,4.01
"anything painful, is terrible for you.",305.63,2.77
Even fungal toenails.,308.4,1.29
"They're not normal. That
could lead to problems.",309.69,2.85
Go check with your podiatrist.,312.54,1.78
"And if your feet are numb,",314.32,1.52
"and you wanna do something
about the numbness,",315.84,2.16
we have a great video up here that goes on,318.0,3.29
