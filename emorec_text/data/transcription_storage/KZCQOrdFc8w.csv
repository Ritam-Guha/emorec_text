my name is kevin harris i have,0.0,4.11
hemophilia B I am currently a graphic,1.53,4.979
designer and actually also developing,4.11,4.35
nutrition and fitness programs for the,6.509,3.751
hemophilia community i was diagnosed,8.46,5.13
after i started playing sports so my,10.26,5.61
parents actually kind of already knew i,13.59,4.859
was in an active lifestyle so they let,15.87,4.8
me continue but there definitely were,18.449,5.311
the drawbacks obviously playing soccer,20.67,5.58
they're definitely worth some bleeds but,23.76,4.109
it wasn't too hard to manage as a family,26.25,4.109
so it was a like I said there were ups,27.869,5.551
and downs but honestly now to make at,30.359,5.101
this point we did all right I do have a,33.42,4.409
big Fitness background I've been,35.46,3.869
personal training for quite a while now,37.829,4.621
and use most of my time my personal time,39.329,5.421
to study diet and nutrition and exercise,42.45,5.22
since I have moderate hemophilia B three,44.75,5.469
percent and I've kind of used fitness,47.67,5.19
and diet to kind of create a resilient,50.219,7.68
body I'm on on demand but luckily year,52.86,7.62
2014 I only had to infuse one time when,57.899,5.041
I first started using we actually had to,60.48,5.3
have a home health care company come and,62.94,6.929
so you know I'd have a bleed we,65.78,5.56
obviously have to call in and say hey,69.869,2.82
you know we need you to send a nurse,71.34,3.389
over we we need to infuse today and,72.689,3.871
sometimes you know that that may have,74.729,5.371
lasted three or four days so really when,76.56,5.79
I first started infusing it was a little,80.1,3.839
bit tedious and difficult only because,82.35,3.99
it was a few years before I learned to,83.939,4.29
self infuse and that definitely helped,86.34,5.01
speed things up a bit definitely the,88.229,4.171
first infusion was a little,91.35,3.54
nerve-wracking only because you know as,92.4,5.789
a young kid I'm not used to being stuck,94.89,6.63
with needles very frequently so it's,98.189,6.871
definitely an awakening and like i said,101.52,5.099
i'd probably at that point I didn't,105.06,4.019
really understand why necessarily i was,106.619,3.721
having to do it i just knew that I had,109.079,4.021
to so it was there's a little bit scary,110.34,5.16
at first getting used to everything but,113.1,4.65
you know once I started learning why I,115.5,4.619
had to and the effect it had and things,117.75,5.67
became a little easier so um,120.119,5.521
really the best advice I can give for uh,123.42,5.36
for new parents with with the hemophilia,125.64,7.02
child is that really that that fear,128.78,6.69
almost I think fear is the enemy I,132.66,5.22
really think that hemophilia is not an,135.47,4.54
end-all you know it's especially in,137.88,4.38
these days was with all of our medical,140.01,5.72
advances and everything I think that,142.26,6.449
hemophilia is can be serious but it's,145.73,4.87
very manageable if you use you know,148.709,4.411
proper precaution and you know you work,150.6,3.84
on keeping your body healthy and,153.12,3.42
resilient so like I said it can be,154.44,4.32
serious at times but i'm definitely not,156.54,4.77
anything to to take take away any,158.76,5.15
happiness from life,161.31,2.6
