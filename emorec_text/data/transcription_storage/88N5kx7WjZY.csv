alright let's dive into and stage renal,0.26,4.93
disease so if you notice in my last,2.85,3.84
video I talked about chronic kidney,5.19,2.999
disease if you didn't have a chance to,6.69,2.909
watch it going and take a look at it now,8.189,2.611
you'll probably find it in the,9.599,3.721
description below in stage renal disease,10.8,5.009
is chronic kidney disease except for to,13.32,4.289
the extreme where the kidneys are no,15.809,3.48
longer functioning or just very little,17.609,7.141
function so has saved all the same risk,19.289,7.23
factors and causes chronic kidney,24.75,2.609
disease,26.519,3.691
signs and symptoms it's just to the,27.359,5.101
extreme so really what you'll see with,30.21,3.689
these patients is their kidneys aren't,32.46,4.02
predict filtering the waste products so,33.899,4.261
if you look at the labs they're going to,36.48,3.509
have way too much potassium magnesium,38.16,4.62
phosphorus they're going to have tons of,39.989,5.721
waste that being Ukrainian we elevated,42.78,5.73
me myself I work on a rental floor when,45.71,4.39
I have one these patients are being une,48.51,2.22
crannies,50.1,2.22
just through the roof at that point you,50.73,3.39
don't even really monitor anymore you,52.32,3.6
start watching the electrolytes more,54.12,3.48
closely and making sure you maintain,55.92,4.08
those also these patients are going to,57.6,4.83
the risk of fluid overload because of,60.0,5.28
not Monica filtering out and maintaining,62.43,3.869
their fluid balance because their,65.28,3.03
kidneys aren't producing here in fact,66.299,5.43
people of NC area disease sometimes from,68.31,5.489
another very little urine or no urine at,71.729,6.39
all now these patients tribute for these,73.799,8.131
patients typically involves dialysis now,78.119,6.981
there are several varieties of dialysis,81.93,5.88
the two major would being hemodialysis,85.1,5.08
and peritoneal dialysis today I'll talk,87.81,4.349
a little bit about hemodialysis and I'm,90.18,3.24
going to have another video you'll see,92.159,3.03
later in this playlist talking just,93.42,3.87
about hemodialysis but care before after,95.189,4.68
during and different types of accesses,97.29,5.009
so for these patients you want to have,99.869,3.78
them on a renal diet which is low in,102.299,4.051
potassium phosphorus sodium and,103.649,5.58
magnesium sodium because sodium and,106.35,5.07
water go together so if they have lots,109.229,3.39
of sodium in your diet they're going to,111.42,3.059
have more fluid staying in their,112.619,3.6
bloodstream and it's going to put my,114.479,3.93
higher risk for fluid overload these,116.219,3.54
patients are going to con a fluid,118.409,3.21
"restriction typically this is 1,200 to",119.759,4.621
"1,500 cc's per day and you want to be",121.619,4.731
sure that you educate the patient,124.38,3.849
regularly to make sure they stay,126.35,4.189
restrict fluid restrictions you're also,128.229,3.631
going to have medications that are,130.539,4.111
binders such as phosphorus binders these,131.86,4.08
are medicines that the patient will take,134.65,2.729
with every meal and it binds with the,135.94,4.2
phosphorus in the food so that instead,137.379,4.44
of it going into the bloodstream it is,140.14,5.599
excreted in their defecation and,141.819,6.241
dialysis now the dialysis is what this,145.739,4.121
is going to do is it's going to correct,148.06,3.39
electron imbalances and it's going to,149.86,3.659
pull off the fluids that the patient is,151.45,5.91
no longer able to urinate out so what we,153.519,5.671
want to watch out for four of em stage,157.36,4.2
renal patients you want to watch out for,159.19,4.29
their labs going out of whack and this,161.56,5.34
is shown by them having arrhythmias they,163.48,4.83
have too much potassium they may be,166.9,3.899
having cardiac arrhythmias such as,168.31,6.0
ventricular fibrillation or v-tach SVT,170.799,5.16
you want to watch for arrhythmias,174.31,3.33
typically these patients are on a,175.959,4.201
telemetry much my own monitor you want,177.64,3.78
watch for hypertension when they have,180.16,4.139
fluid overload that's a lot more volume,181.42,4.11
that's hearts pumping around and they,184.299,3.03
may have hypertension this puts them of,185.53,5.25
course at risk for cardiac problems for,187.329,6.361
stroke you also want to watch out for,190.78,3.45
angina,193.69,2.879
the heart is funk all this extra fluid,194.23,5.25
and the electrolytes are off the heart,196.569,4.381
is at risk for developing arrhythmias,199.48,3.9
which may lead to ischemia to the heart,200.95,5.369
and so the heart you are at risk for,203.38,5.34
having myocardial infarctions and so you,206.319,3.661
want to watch out for them complaining,208.72,4.32
of chest pains also left fluid overload,209.98,4.68
will lead to pulmonary edema which is,213.04,3.18
too much fluid in the body and then it,214.66,4.35
starts depositing itself around the,216.22,4.829
lungs so when you go to listen to their,219.01,4.5
lungs you'll be hearing very moist and,221.049,4.291
wet sounds or under lungs are having,223.51,3.839
shortness of breath their own oxygen,225.34,4.14
saturations are dropping and so you want,227.349,4.32
to watch for this in the case of these,229.48,5.93
typically they may need medication or,231.669,9.21
emergency dialysis and so I want you to,235.41,7.24
go ahead and take a look if you're,240.879,3.991
sitting humid office my next video is,242.65,3.479
going to talk about what you actually do,244.87,3.899
these patients on a regular day in the,246.129,5.341
Med surg floor like a renal floor and,248.769,4.08
this is where I work every day so I'm,251.47,2.4
going to talk to you about what we're,252.849,3.121
going to do to prepare for dialysis what,253.87,3.359
we're going to do once they're actually,255.97,2.669
in dialysis and then what we do,257.229,4.07
once we get them out,258.639,2.66
