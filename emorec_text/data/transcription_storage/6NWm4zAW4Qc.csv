today's topic is gangrene macroscopic,0.079,5.671
death of tissue with superadded,3.54,5.94
purification is the definition it,5.75,5.95
affects the limbs intestines appendix,9.48,4.739
etc in this webinar I will discuss,11.7,5.61
basically diabetic angry they can be,14.219,6.361
many causes of gangrene namely arterial,17.31,5.549
occlusion like atherosclerosis embolism,20.58,4.08
from meningitis obliterans also called,22.859,3.99
as Burges disease and right right as,24.66,5.58
obliterans cervical drip etc venous,26.849,5.01
obstruction like deep venous thrombosis,30.24,3.87
can cause gangrene neurological diseases,31.859,4.621
like hemiplegia paraplegia pressure,34.11,4.98
ulcers can cause in green traumatic,36.48,4.77
gangrene due to direct trauma like,39.09,3.719
thrombosis or indirect due to crash,41.25,4.469
injuries infection boil carbuncle gas,42.809,5.221
gangrene due to cost radium diabetes,45.719,4.651
itself can cause gangrene and physical,48.03,4.41
causes like radiation corrosives,50.37,5.79
medications so let's talk about briefly,52.44,7.349
on diabetic gangrene diabetics possess,56.16,6.239
distinct problems which make their limbs,59.789,5.671
more liable to gangrene formation mainly,62.399,5.871
three factors play major roles one,65.46,5.22
sugar-laden tissues of the diabetics,68.27,4.419
lower their resistance to infection,70.68,5.34
after trivial injury to the toe or sole,72.689,5.341
of the foot of the heel within hours or,76.02,3.72
days several and necrotizing infection,78.03,3.839
may appear which spreads along the,79.74,4.35
muscular fascial plane the infecting,81.869,5.011
organism may often be gas-producing of,84.09,5.31
the classical group although any type of,86.88,4.379
infection may occur including fungal,89.4,5.789
infections second in the lower limb,91.259,6.691
however the arterial occlusive disease,95.189,5.701
mainly involves the popliteal artery and,97.95,6.419
its branches down to the pedal arches it,100.89,5.79
is important to note that in patients,104.369,4.921
who are on dialysis it is a peroneal,106.68,6.619
artery that is most commonly affected,109.29,4.009
arteries proximal to the popliteal,113.54,6.579
arteries are usually not affected and if,116.82,6.42
affected show non diabetic type Atris,120.119,6.331
chlorosis the third peculiarity of the,123.24,6.03
diabetics is diabetic neuropathy this,126.45,7.24
impaired sensation involves lower limbs,129.27,6.91
causing injuries and infections on the,133.69,5.43
plaintiff foot as a result of this the,136.18,5.73
pressure areas of the foot the heel the,139.12,5.49
ball of the foot become developed a,141.91,5.22
neuropathic diabetic ulcer and due to,144.61,4.8
neuropathy the muscular involvement may,147.13,4.13
also be seen in the form of loss of,149.41,5.01
reflexes and deformities like short cuts,151.26,5.68
for the feet may be splayed and deformed,154.42,4.2
calluses may develop and the plantar,156.94,4.77
foot and if not taken care of it favors,158.62,6.21
entry of infection the clinical features,161.71,5.64
of debris gangrene are pain in,164.83,4.38
ulceration there may be loss of,167.35,4.62
sensation Doppler signal for pulse may,169.21,5.64
be absent change of color of skin and,171.97,4.56
temperature when gangrene is impending,174.85,6.75
and there may be abscess formation both,176.53,7.2
dry and wet type gangrene are seen in,181.6,5.37
diabetics dry gangrene occurs more,183.73,6.39
frequently in old diabetic patients dry,186.97,5.7
gangrene is only possible when the,190.12,5.4
infection factor is minimum and the,192.67,4.92
occlusive factor of the artery is,195.52,5.52
maximum the gangrene slowly progresses,197.59,7.53
with a line of demarkation wet gangrene,201.04,6.89
is more often seen in younger diabetics,205.12,5.91
infection plays a major role in forming,207.93,5.59
this type of gangrene which is very much,211.03,7.71
spreading and can often be lethal the,213.52,6.93
workup that we'd like to get in these,218.74,5.16
patients are we like to see the blood,220.45,6.72
sugar log at the bedside we would like,223.9,6.33
to get hemoglobin a1c levels serum,227.17,4.53
creatinine levels at diabetic,230.23,4.5
nephropathy is a comorbidity wound,231.7,6.21
culture and sensitivity ankle brachial,234.73,6.18
index Doppler study in arterial duplex,237.91,6.24
studies an x-ray or MRI if a stream,240.91,7.829
alight is a suspected overall diabetes,244.15,7.02
should be controlled by medications or,248.739,4.891
insulin or diet control but vasodilators,251.17,5.61
likes elasto soul and pentoxifylline a,253.63,6.41
low dose aspirin often play a major role,256.78,5.73
care of the foot by avoiding injury,260.04,3.939
keeping it clean and dry,262.51,3.51
particularly attention to our 30-foot,263.979,3.451
wear is very important,266.02,3.48
and when there is infection antibiotics,267.43,5.19
should be prescribed in early cases of,269.5,5.389
course widespread incision and drainage,272.62,4.53
debridement of the wound should be,274.889,5.25
performed careful localized debridement,277.15,6.03
combined with intensive antibiotic,280.139,5.291
therapy has often been successful in,283.18,5.01
saving the lemon the most important,285.43,4.95
aspect of such a debridement is a,288.19,5.27
removal of all necrotic tissues,290.38,6.3
inadequate debridement leaving deep,293.46,5.38
necrotic tissues is the main cause of,296.68,5.94
failure of the treatment dragon green is,298.84,5.97
best treated by postponing any operation,302.62,4.29
allowing auto amputation to take place,304.81,8.329
over a period of weeks thank you,306.91,6.229
