so my name is Anna and for the last 12,0.0,3.959
years I struggled with the symptoms that,2.04,4.92
come alongside PCOS otherwise known as,3.959,5.1
polycystic ovary syndrome when I was,6.96,3.84
first diagnosed with PCOS at the age of,9.059,3.71
12 I was struggling with my way and,10.8,4.919
words like infertility and type 2,12.769,4.84
diabetes were being thrown around me at,15.719,3.511
doctor's appointments and I was,17.609,4.711
terrified no idea what was going on for,19.23,5.85
those of you not in the know lucky you,22.32,5.219
polycystic ovary syndrome is a very,25.08,3.99
common condition at which according to,27.539,3.931
the NHS affects one in five women,29.07,4.56
basically it's caused by an abnormal,31.47,4.109
level of hormones and your body,33.63,4.8
specifically estrogen testosterone and,35.579,6.121
insulin there are a couple of widely,38.43,5.37
known symptoms that come alongside PCOS,41.7,4.62
but there are several that nobody talks,43.8,4.41
about and that I am still learning about,46.32,4.82
the most common side effect PCOS is,48.21,5.31
irregular periods which can often lead,51.14,3.82
to difficulties when it comes to,53.52,3.48
conceiving other symptoms include,54.96,4.56
excessive hair growth weight gain and,57.0,4.98
darkening of skin these are just some of,59.52,4.74
the symptoms which affect women with,61.98,3.359
PCOS,64.26,3.66
some people might speeds and Fertel as,65.339,4.53
he but be underweight and how the,67.92,4.47
smoothness of phases other symptoms of,69.869,4.231
which many women experience include,72.39,4.83
anxiety and depression mood swings joint,74.1,5.4
pains here thinning and insulin,77.22,4.56
resistance going up I had some of these,79.5,4.5
symptoms but in recent years I've,81.78,3.51
learned that the ones that aren't,84.0,3.54
readily discussed all the time are the,85.29,4.439
ones that affected and continue to,87.54,3.869
affect me when I was first diagnosed,89.729,4.021
with PCOS it was a very confusing time I,91.409,5.1
was becoming a teenager which in itself,93.75,5.1
is a very confusing time but a teenager,96.509,5.4
with PCOS I was making silly life,98.85,6.93
choices I was going for fad diets and,101.909,6.39
that as a habit that I'm still trying to,105.78,5.4
break however symptoms like my mental,108.299,4.32
health was something that I was never,111.18,3.689
told about throughout my late teens and,112.619,6.42
my 20s I felt like I was going crazy,114.869,5.79
I was experiencing some of the highest,119.039,4.171
highs and the lowest lows and it wasn't,120.659,5.161
until I realized that other women who,123.21,4.74
have PCOS were also going through the,125.82,3.63
same emotions I awaked,127.95,3.75
and my mental health are something that,129.45,5.88
often go hand in hand and my fluctuating,131.7,5.49
weight gain has been incredibly,135.33,4.439
exhausting to work through from my own,137.19,4.53
personal experience and from what I was,139.769,4.47
told when I was younger and as I could,141.72,4.56
control my weight which was a direct,144.239,5.25
result of having PCOS the seven times,146.28,5.67
all of my PCOS would significantly,149.489,4.351
decrease which would then improve my,151.95,5.34
fertility so suddenly it became ironic,153.84,5.88
that the weight that I held became the,157.29,4.38
weight on my shoulders people often,159.72,5.01
thought that my PCOS was an excuse for,161.67,4.62
me being overweight and it still bothers,164.73,4.2
me when I get comments about it because,166.29,5.22
I don't know how to tell someone that,168.93,3.99
their diet,171.51,3.21
or their workout plan may not,172.92,3.69
necessarily affect me in the same way it,174.72,3.989
affects them life with PCOS is a,176.61,3.87
struggle both on the inside and the,178.709,4.68
