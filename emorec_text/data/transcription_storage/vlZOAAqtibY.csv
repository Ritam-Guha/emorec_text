so I had a question from someone that,0.03,3.24
was on metformin because they were a,1.62,3.57
diabetic and they wanted to know is that,3.27,4.2
gonna bump me out of ketosis is it gonna,5.19,4.67
prevent me getting into ketosis,7.47,5.85
well metformin is used for type 2,9.86,5.319
diabetes is also used for polycystic,13.32,5.16
ovarian syndrome and it doesn't increase,15.179,6.6
insulin like other diabetic medications,18.48,6.389
do it basically focuses on the insulin,21.779,6.481
receptor okay so it targets insulin,24.869,6.691
resistance it allows the insulin to be,28.26,5.61
more efficient and to work better in the,31.56,4.92
body okay so that sounds good,33.87,5.67
it sounds like a great strategy doctors,36.48,5.25
say it's safe you know it's all the,39.54,4.74
medications it's at least damaging then,41.73,5.97
why do they put a black box warning on,44.28,7.14
this medication okay I mean in order to,47.7,6.179
put a black box warning there has to be,51.42,6.45
some serious side effects there is small,53.879,7.741
but fatal lactic acidosis risk okay so,57.87,5.849
there's a small risk that you may,61.62,4.71
develop lactic acidosis and there's a,63.719,5.01
complication that you may die but it's a,66.33,3.78
small risk so they have to put this,68.729,4.531
black box warning so what is lactic,70.11,6.66
acidosis well it's a condition where you,73.26,5.429
become hypoxic you you decrease your,76.77,5.31
oxygen absorption to the cells your pH,78.689,5.97
becomes more acidic in the blood you get,82.08,5.1
tired electrical problems with the heart,84.659,5.46
like an electrolytes you can have heart,87.18,7.079
arrhythmias abdominal pain and this side,90.119,7.591
effect of death if you're a diabetic and,94.259,5.4
you're taking metformin or you know,97.71,5.369
someone that's taking metformin this is,99.659,6.511
what you need to know right here severe,103.079,6.591
lactic acidosis can be reversed by,106.17,7.8
thiamine that's vitamin b1 within 24,109.67,6.76
hours I'll put the data down below you,113.97,5.46
can check it out it's a very simple,116.43,7.579
solution to a very major problem okay b1,119.43,8.46
you also need to know this metformin,124.009,7.361
inhibits be warned transportation so,127.89,5.819
basically it blocks b1,131.37,4.589
the more you take metformin the more you,133.709,4.351
depleted with b1 the more you're,135.959,3.661
deficient the more you're gonna have,138.06,4.62
lactic acidosis it's kind of crazy so,139.62,5.1
you need to know that like if you're,142.68,3.54
taking that form and you want to take it,144.72,4.469
you better be taking b1 the ideal scene,146.22,6.329
is to just do healthy keto and then I'm,149.189,4.711
gonna fasting to the point where you,152.549,3.631
don't need this anymore now the other,153.9,4.47
interesting thing is this there's,156.18,4.29
certain contraindications for taking,158.37,4.64
that form in the first place if you have,160.47,5.189
kidney damage or liver damage or,163.01,5.319
cardiovascular damage they don't want,165.659,4.98
you to take that form in because it will,168.329,4.08
increase the risk of eating a lot again,170.639,5.13
so dosis now if someone's taking that,172.409,5.491
form in there probably a diabetic right,175.769,4.431
as a diabetic they probably have some,177.9,5.009
kidney liver and heart problems don't,180.2,5.05
they so I guess you have to be pretty,182.909,5.61
healthy to take neck Foreman nowadays to,185.25,6.03
prevent this risk again it's very very,188.519,6.271
simple take vitamin b1 and you can,191.28,6.209
actually greatly reduce the risk of,194.79,6.46
lactic acidosis thanks for watching,197.489,6.311
