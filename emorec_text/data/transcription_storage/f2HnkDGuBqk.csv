"Welcome to Highfalutin"" Low Carb! The",0.0,2.1
weekly web series where we find and test,2.1,2.01
"the best low carb recipes. (static)  Hey, guys",4.11,9.3
good morning.,13.41,2.01
I bet I look amazing it's early on,15.42,4.17
Monday morning don't get worried,19.59,1.89
nothing's gone wrong with the other show,21.48,1.95
it'll be back I just wanted to try,23.43,2.22
something a little bit different I've,25.65,2.61
wondered how very sleepy I've often,28.26,3.15
wondered how sweeteners artificial,31.41,2.73
sweeteners real sweeteners affect my,34.14,2.13
blood sugar so I've devised a little,36.27,2.49
plan wherein every morning I'm going to,38.76,2.25
get up and have a couple of cups of,41.01,1.38
coffee just like I normally do and each,42.39,2.22
morning I'm going to put in a different,44.61,1.08
sugar or sugar substitute and then I'm,45.69,4.56
going to use my handy-dandy,50.25,3.68
yeah nothing to test my blood sugar and,54.71,3.579
see how this goes so I can definitively,58.289,2.34
know if erythritol does or does not,60.629,2.52
spike my blood sugar or monk fruit or,63.149,2.241
equal or sweet and low whatever they may,65.39,2.38
be it's a little unnerving knowing that,67.77,2.73
I'm going to start out my days for the,70.5,1.68
next few days at least with something,72.18,3.119
that could possibly spike my blood sugar,75.299,1.921
but this is in the name of science so,77.22,3.48
I'm kind of quietly speaking because the,80.7,2.279
house is still asleep it's very early,82.979,1.591
here as you can tell so um anyway I'm,84.57,4.439
going to test my blood sugar this,89.009,1.171
morning before I have any coffee and,90.18,2.28
then today I'm not using any sweetener,92.46,2.159
just do it like I normally do with heavy,94.619,2.011
whipping cream just a tablespoon of that,96.63,1.86
so will will test that to get a baseline,98.49,3.21
of what my blood sugar does in the,101.7,1.44
morning and we'll go from there,103.14,1.589
all right guys whew it's amazing how,104.729,4.441
terrible I look at a green light at 5:45,109.17,4.17
in the morning all right I'll meet you,113.34,4.26
back here every morning it's a date bye,117.6,3.299
guys,120.899,2.18
hey guys we're back this morning blood,139.62,4.42
sugar rose a little yesterday from like,144.04,2.07
80 to 100 within the hour of getting up,146.11,3.18
didn't have any sugar in the coffee did,149.29,2.34
have two tablespoons of whipping cream,151.63,2.91
so we're going to do some black coffee,154.54,1.919
one day this week as well just to test,156.459,2.731
that today is going to be a risk for,159.19,2.28
tall so let me get a quick blood,161.47,1.95
pressure me blood pressure blood sugar,163.42,2.01
reading for this morning because I need,165.43,4.139
"some coffee. Yeah, I'm sleepy. It's odd letting",169.569,5.341
people see your bed-head and morning,174.91,2.49
sleepy time face. All of these things,177.4,6.75
are so fiddly and sharp that's a lot to,184.15,4.23
"deal with in the morning, to be honest with",188.38,2.82
you if you're diabetic this isn't fun I,191.2,3.27
guess I'm not diabetic I just happen to,194.47,2.04
have one of these that I wanted to test,196.51,2.069
sugar with just for dietary reasons so,198.579,4.711
hate that thing alright let's see what,203.29,2.46
it is 96 this morning anyway I'm gonna,205.75,4.079
bring some coffee bye guys,209.829,3.351
okay good morning we're back again very,216.42,5.25
sleepy this morning I ran out of test,221.67,3.39
strips yesterday so I had to I had to,225.06,2.73
take a hiatus for one day but we're,227.79,2.22
going to resume today and paint these,230.01,1.44
things are expensive like 25 but 29,231.45,2.94
bucks for 25 of these that's cuckoo,234.39,2.46
because I don't really need them for,236.85,2.34
medical reasons obviously munch does it,239.19,2.58
cover them so let's do this again today,241.77,2.73
what are we going to have today Oh today,244.5,2.91
is going to be Splenda which I'm scared,247.41,4.23
of and I don't really like but all in,251.64,5.01
the name of science guys all in the name,256.65,2.94
of science Oh Lord are you seeing Jesus,259.59,4.44
Christ okay okay let's do this one,264.03,5.52
anybody is going to hurt it'll YG's,269.55,2.66
he'll 102,272.21,2.38
all right time for coffee,274.59,4.94
good morning guys it's the weekend I'm,283.6,2.67
trying to be quiet we've actually got,286.27,1.35
some family in the house today we had a,287.62,1.53
family reunion I did pretty well I was,289.15,2.58
actually kind of scared about that,291.73,2.13
because as you can imagine a family,293.86,1.65
reunion in the south involves tons of,295.51,3.21
food but I did well anyway today I think,298.72,3.6
I'm going to test a monk fruit the NuNaturals,302.32,1.92
brand monk fruit a very dear,304.24,2.46
friend of mine from college hi Elin we,306.7,3.36
were chatting on Facebook and she told,310.06,1.71
me the wonderful things about monk fruit,311.77,2.75
and I told her I was skeptical of it,314.52,2.29
"because I've heard so much about the ""In",316.81,2.94
"The Raw"" brand which obviously is mixed",319.75,4.05
with dextrose and maltodextrin and I,323.8,2.76
said I was scared of what's going to,326.56,1.23
spike me and she told me of the new,327.79,2.04
naturals brands which is supposedly only,329.83,1.59
monk fruit in fact it comes in like a,331.42,2.13
salt shaker situation where you shake it,333.55,2.37
on your food because you have to use so,335.92,1.68
little of it I think it says something,337.6,2.07
like 1/64 of a teaspoon is equivalent to,339.67,4.89
two teaspoons of sugar so this stuff is,344.56,2.31
crazy strong so I'm going to try that,346.87,2.1
today and see how it goes I'm filming,348.97,2.25
I'll do just want me I guess I need to,351.22,4.02
go,355.24,2.15
hey guys guess what it's Monday morning,362.55,5.35
again. Booo. I had a wonderful weekend I've,367.9,4.079
had family in town for a big family,371.979,2.131
reunion anyway I think today I'm going,374.11,2.94
to do one of the sweeteners that I,377.05,2.91
avoided last week and I don't really,379.96,2.73
want to do and that's odd to say but,382.69,2.61
it's sugar I'm just curious what it does,385.3,4.04
but it's frustrating to know that you,389.34,3.46
know everybody wants to start a diet on,392.8,2.579
a Monday morning and here I will be um,395.379,3.921
basically sabotaging that in some way,399.3,3.22
all in the name of this whatever this,402.52,2.84
project is them I'm trying to find out,405.36,2.89
all I mean let the dog out and oh come,408.25,3.84
on if you I'm trying to keep it about a,412.09,4.139
two teaspoon equivalent for all of these,416.229,2.071
sweeteners per cup of coffee and I'm,418.3,1.679
having two cups of coffee,419.979,1.31
my 7:30 but I'm only putting three yep,421.289,4.03
tell my gluttony I actually have three,425.319,2.34
but I'm only putting sweeteners in the,427.659,1.951
first two which I'd am pretty quickly to,429.61,2.1
try to get the sugar into me and capping,431.71,3.019
so anyway I'm rambling this morning,434.729,2.59
let's take our sugar here and see what,437.319,2.25
it is this Monday morning here we go. Ow!,439.569,6.181
Surprises you every time! okay I've just,445.75,2.909
sat down out here and with my first cup,448.659,2.581
of coffee of the morning and I really,451.24,1.919
wanted to make a big deal of it and say,453.159,2.13
oh yeah sugar tastes terrible home I'm,455.289,3.81
so good now I don't even like sugar that,459.099,2.671
would be a big lie to you and to me it,461.77,2.609
tastes like magic so I want to sit out,464.379,3.9
here and enjoy it and hope to god it,468.279,2.311
doesn't screw me up for the rest of the,470.59,1.35
day and cause me to crepe everything,471.94,1.589
under the Sun I don't need that on a,473.529,1.801
Monday we got to talk,475.33,2.519
I used to don't do a video update after,477.849,2.13
I drink my coffee I just take a photo of,479.979,2.041
my blood sugar I don't know if you can,482.02,3.869
see that if you focus on that because,485.889,1.59
it's only 1:45 an hour out now,487.479,6.041
less than an hour and my sugar has gone,493.52,1.92
from 100 to 145 so wowzers I'm not,495.44,5.699
looking forward to the rest of the day,501.139,1.231
because of that either,502.37,1.139
anyway I just wanted to let you know,503.509,1.831
that sucks,505.34,1.5
bye good morning here we are again is,506.84,6.42
wicked early this morning I've been,513.26,2.31
putting off testing the pink and blue,515.57,1.74
stuff the sweet and low and the equal,517.31,3.87
because I hate to them so no matter what,521.18,3.87
it says with my blood sugar I will never,525.05,1.77
use them just because they're taste,526.82,2.43
terrible and make me feel terrible so,529.25,1.74
but I want to do it in the name of science,530.99,2.039
here so let's see what we've got,533.029,4.611
oops,540.31,1.149
oh damn my machine is in the kitchen,541.459,3.211
charging I'll be back hold on okay now,544.67,7.53
that is spitting so again these things,552.2,3.69
are fiddly yeah still bleeding you smash,555.89,2.79
on them and that's the dirty when old,558.68,2.43
when Jesus is too early to cow literally,561.11,5.46
bitch laughing you're in majare God come,566.57,2.67
be calculated by the time he gets here,569.24,1.469
come on tar out Aloha 102 I mean I guess,570.709,5.671
that's I don't really know we know some,576.38,2.1
days it's been 80 in the morning and,578.48,1.229
some days it's been a hundred so alright,579.709,1.561
I'm gonna go drink some coffee I think,581.27,1.8
I'll do the blue stuff today the equal,583.07,2.04
so beat you in the morning okay what 100,585.11,10.86
again how much right on so um today,595.97,4.559
we're going to try a product that I,600.529,2.191
really like and I have some suspicions,602.72,4.41
that it probably does spike my blood,607.13,1.709
"sugar I'm not sure. Yikes, my shirt's",608.839,2.131
coming off. Fiber Syrup. Let's try to get it in,610.97,3.359
the light can you say that Fiber Syrup,614.329,2.311
Gold this stuff is from Denmark and it,616.64,7.319
claims to have per two tablespoons,623.959,3.061
thirty total carbohydrates twenty-eight,627.02,4.08
of which are fiber and two of which are,631.1,2.1
sugars we're going to see if that's true,633.2,2.58
this stuff is delicious that's the hope,635.78,5.31
it doesn't spike me because I love this,641.09,1.86
stuff as you see the bottle is almost,642.95,1.32
all gone,644.27,0.6
it tastes like pancake syrup and I,644.87,2.58
joking is good so say no prayer for me,647.45,4.71
that this doesn't spike my blood sugar,652.16,1.32
because it's so good so I don't know how,653.48,3.24
to sell we go in coffee I probably,656.72,2.34
wouldn't put pancake syrup in my coffee,659.06,1.5
but just for the purposes of this making,660.56,2.76
everything equal in this test working,663.32,1.59
out them I'm going to use it as coffee,664.91,2.49
sweetener for today I'm following the,667.4,2.25
same exact rules using the same average,669.65,1.92
quantities of two teaspoons per cup,671.57,2.43
alright so I'm going to record this,674.0,2.16
we'll make a coffee and let's do this,676.16,1.74
again oh my god I cannot use fiber syrup,677.9,5.79
ever ever again this magic stuff that I,683.69,3.9
was talking about how fantastic it was,687.59,2.57
there's a reason that it's so fantastic,690.16,2.77
a hundred and eighty-nine one serving,692.93,7.41
size is two tablespoons of this I used,700.34,2.73
four teaspoons two teaspoons in each cup,703.07,2.64
of coffee that I had in the first two,705.71,2.88
cups of coffee and my usual creamer I,708.59,2.76
usually have a blood sugar rise of 10 or,711.35,3.03
15 points and that's probably from the,714.38,2.01
creamer we're going to test that later,716.39,1.59
in the week I'm gonna have to coffee,717.98,1.14
without the cream probably tomorrow,719.12,1.61
y'all 90 point 89 points my blood sugar,720.73,4.12
shot up that was more than the sugar,724.85,2.46
I used pure sugar 4 teaspoons of pure,727.31,2.64
sugar and my blood sugar only went up to,729.95,3.62
UM 147 it is at 189 gosh Sukrin Fiber,733.57,7.9
Syrup Gold can't do it any more sugar,741.47,2.64
booger,744.11,0.51
Gonna have to throw you in the garbage,744.62,2.24
damn stuff is good no it's pure sugar,746.86,6.6
good morning guys um I do believe this,755.24,3.61
is the last day of this little project,758.85,3.179
we've been doing here together it's,762.029,1.8
almost been to two weeks I think I don't,763.829,2.731
know exactly how many 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9,766.56,5.64
10 11 so it's been 11 days Bakcell days,772.2,2.69
there were a couple of days missed in,774.89,2.199
there so we've hit and touched on most,777.089,1.861
all of the major sweeteners so I believe,778.95,2.579
I got them all so today is the last day,781.529,2.071
I'm going to do coffee with no cream,783.6,1.979
today just black coffee the same brand,785.579,2.401
of coffee I've been using all week and,787.98,2.69
well they're from there just to see how,790.67,2.68
much the creamer actually has been,793.35,1.77
affecting my sugars and then I'm going,795.12,1.709
to compile all of this today or tomorrow,796.829,2.491
I just want to reiterate and I'm,799.32,2.13
probably going to say this in a better,801.45,1.02
way but later when awake I'm not a,802.47,3.84
doctor I am NOT diabetic I have not been,806.31,2.49
trained on how to do any of this this is,808.8,1.77
just a project for me a project for me,810.57,3.15
to tell myself how these things have,813.72,1.5
affected me and I had one little shock,815.22,1.619
there as you know with that secret fiber,816.839,2.131
gold what a disappointment and had I not,818.97,3.42
done this how many days weeks months,822.39,2.759
years what I have gone pouring that,825.149,2.37
stuff on man just but yeah this is like,827.519,2.911
our hmmm yeah it's not affecting me a,830.43,2.04
bit and meanwhile my blood sugar stood,832.47,2.97
roof so channel way back to normal next,835.44,3.12
