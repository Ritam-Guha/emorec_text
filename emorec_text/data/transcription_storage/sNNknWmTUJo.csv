hi guys in this video I want to talk,0.0,3.659
about why diabetics tend to get high,1.319,4.951
blood pressure okay well first of all if,3.659,4.77
you're a type 2 diabetic you have,6.27,4.59
insulin resistance which means you have,8.429,5.34
higher levels of insulin okay so what,10.86,5.279
happens the insulin is not working so,13.769,3.991
you have to take metformin or glucophage,16.139,3.931
to be able to get the receptor to obsess,17.76,5.67
accept insulin but then on the other,20.07,4.89
hand because there's no return,23.43,3.48
communication to the pancreas the,24.96,4.35
feedback loops you get increased insulin,26.91,5.34
by five to seven times a normal person,29.31,5.22
if you want others to understand more of,32.25,3.54
that I put a link down below but the,34.53,3.42
point is that diabetics type to have,35.79,4.589
higher levels of insulin which then,37.95,5.91
cause the retention of sodium okay which,40.379,5.551
then caused the retention of water so,43.86,4.62
they have edema swelling and yes also,45.93,4.949
increase insulin increases inflammation,48.48,5.419
in the arteries as well as certain,50.879,5.45
constriction in the tone of the vessels,53.899,4.451
but the point is that the main thing,56.329,4.0
will do is a cause retention of sodium,58.35,4.59
retention of fluid increased blood,60.329,5.61
pressure that's that's the mechanism now,62.94,4.77
the treatment of course is to go on a,65.939,4.47
low salt diet right well what's gonna,67.71,4.5
happen if you lower salt you still,70.409,4.381
haven't fixed the high insulin so now,72.21,5.61
you create a sodium deficiency so you're,74.79,6.17
going to get weakness fatigue constant,77.82,5.85
constipation things like that because,80.96,5.08
you need a certain amount of sodium for,83.67,4.949
a nerve and muscle function and then,86.04,4.619
there's you put on medication usually a,88.619,5.011
diuretic which then has a side effect of,90.659,6.301
lowering potassium well guess what,93.63,5.94
if you lower potassium which normally,96.96,4.32
lowers blood pressure you're going to,99.57,3.869
increase the relative ratio of higher,101.28,4.949
sodium when you because potassium and,103.439,4.89
sodium work together so you don't want,106.229,3.721
to lose any more potassium from your,108.329,3.9
body in fact one of the best things you,109.95,3.27
could do if you're diabetic has,112.229,3.18
increased more potassium from the diet a,113.22,4.14
lot of vegetables and even even as a,115.409,3.721
supplement as well when you can improve,117.36,3.09
the situation so you don't want to,119.13,4.26
necessarily restrict sodium too much and,120.45,4.32
then also another side effect from the,123.39,4.29
diuretic is insulin resistance which,124.77,6.12
will increase more insulin,127.68,5.37
so the medication in dips ends up,130.89,4.29
aggravating the condition in making it,133.05,5.52
worse okay why because it's not treating,135.18,5.01
the underlying cause in sort of,138.57,4.8
resistance so here's what do you do what,140.19,4.98
you want to do is get on a keto program,143.37,3.48
I put a link down below which is,145.17,2.58
basically going to reduce your,146.85,2.73
carbohydrates which will then reduce,147.75,4.2
your need for insulin which will then,149.58,4.29
reduce the need for retention of sodium,151.95,4.02
and you'll find that you'll lose your,153.87,4.589
fluid you'll actually have normal,155.97,3.87
balance of sodium and you probably have,158.459,3.781
to consume more sodium because you'll,159.84,4.8
you won't retain it anymore okay,162.24,4.41
so I watched those links down below and,164.64,5.58
let me know what you think hey you,166.65,4.95
probably already subscribed but if you,170.22,3.0
haven't press this little button down,171.6,5.48
below and I will keep you updated,173.22,3.86
