numbness or burning type pain in the bottom  ",6.8,6.96
"of your feet or your fingertips and the most 
common way you would get peripheral neuropathy  ",13.76,5.28
"is by having diabetes and so peripheral neuropathy 
first starts in the longer nerves of the body okay  ",19.84,8.88
"and it happens at the very end of that nerve and 
what's happening is you're getting a destruction  ",28.72,5.68
"of the tiny blood vessels to the nerves and 
the destruction is not necessarily coming from  ",34.4,6.72
"the high sugar directly or high blood glucose 
directly the high blood glucose is creating  ",41.92,7.12
"a lot of inflammation free radical damage and 
destruction to the proteins on the inside of your  ",49.04,9.76
"artery so it's going to clog this thing up it's 
going to starve the blood supply to the nerve now  ",58.8,5.68
"why is that blood supply there to feed the nerve 
oxygen and nutrients and so peripheral neuropathy  ",64.48,7.2
"is basically killing off the nerves so we're 
getting microvascular damage also it's happening  ",71.68,8.56
"in the eye too if you're a diabetic but what i 
want to tell you especially if you're new to my  ",80.24,4.48
"channel and you have peripheral neuropathy it is

right here start consuming low carbs that's  ",91.04,7.76
"called a healthy ketogenic diet start doing low 
carbs immediately i am blown away how many people  ",98.8,7.76
"with peripheral neuropathy don't know this 
information they're doing a high carb diet and  ",106.56,5.76
"they're on the medication and they're suffering so 
bad it's completely unnecessary this condition can  ",112.32,7.52
"be reversed so you start doing low carbohydrate

"with protein like most people do or high carb 
with fat like an ice cream something like that  ",126.32,6.16
"you're creating more damage than just carbs alone 
when you combine a carb with a protein you create  ",133.84,8.0
"something called glycation which basically 
destroys certain proteins in the body that  ",141.84,5.2
"now become permanent it's very difficult to undo 
that and it clogs up all sorts of things as in  ",147.04,7.36
"circulation you also want to make sure that you 
have very low amounts of omega-6 oils in the diet  ",154.4,8.56
"like for example the corn oil the soy oil that's 
in the salad dressing it's in so many foods  ",162.96,6.56
"especially if you go out to eat very often because 
that's what they cook everything with it's also in  ",169.52,4.88

things that can help you get relief immediately  ",186.08,7.44
"you can get these from the health of store 
benfotiamine this is a fat soluble b1 i would take  ",194.32,7.12
"four capsules a day spread them out what this 
does is it helps to lower the inflammation and  ",201.44,9.2
"the damage that's created from the high sugar 
because the high sugar in your blood has created  ",210.64,5.12
"a huge need for more b1 and so what the 
body will do is starts to deplete your  ",216.32,6.64
"b1 reserves until the point where you have no 
more and then you can't actually make the myelin  ",222.96,5.36
"sheath around the nerve which is the insulating 
fat layer so you can't make that without b1  ",228.32,6.64
"so you start putting it back in there and 
things start to heal up alpha lipoic acid  ",234.96,5.76
"is another very important one and even 
this on its own has been known to improve  ",240.72,5.28
"peripheral neuropathies so you can take 
this as a supplement you can get it anywhere  ",246.88,4.24
