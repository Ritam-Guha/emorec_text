when Alex was first diagnosed with,0.089,5.311
diabetes type 1 diabetes we were utterly,2.1,5.88
numb we had heard of diabetes our whole,5.4,4.319
lives we had never associated it with,7.98,11.79
our family you will feel that there's,9.719,11.791
not a lot of people that understand your,19.77,4.169
situation and that's completely normal I,21.51,5.55
felt that way I think in our family what,23.939,6.151
happened was even though there's a lot,27.06,5.309
of information in the beginning or a,30.09,6.0
doctor was great very supportive she was,32.369,7.021
incredibly patient there was nothing,36.09,5.43
that she thought was a silly question,39.39,5.189
and there were times when I was like how,41.52,6.3
am I going to ask this question at 3:00,44.579,6.601
on a Saturday and yet they got back to,47.82,5.91
us and yet we were never meant to feel,51.18,6.3
silly and as more time went by those,53.73,7.29
silly questions became things we knew,57.48,5.969
things that we could handle and things,61.02,5.459
that became routine for us and normal,63.449,6.451
and it was really through their help and,66.479,6.481
their patience and their guidance that,69.9,6.539
it became somewhat normal for us and all,72.96,6.93
of a sudden a couple months in a year in,76.439,6.271
a year and a half in it's just part of,79.89,5.729
your day you get up you have coffee the,82.71,6.119
Sun comes up you move on so I would say,85.619,6.93
that my daughter was diagnosed at 15 and,88.829,8.311
she's now 21 it becomes just part of who,92.549,6.78
they are and what they do and how they,97.14,5.549
live and it does become normal the,99.329,6.511
silver lining on this one is after that,102.689,6.811
normalization happens there is a new,105.84,6.029
perspective on absolutely everything in,109.5,6.54
their lives and it can be really really,111.869,7.79
a wonderful thing for them to kind of,116.04,7.35
understand and they look at life a lot,119.659,5.441
differently and I think that's been very,123.39,3.62
helpful for our family,125.1,4.7
is that if you can live with diet type,127.01,4.86
one diabetes there's not much you can't,129.8,2.67
do,131.87,2.76
