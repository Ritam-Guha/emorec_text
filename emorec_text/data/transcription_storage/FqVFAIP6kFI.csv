hey guys in this video we're gonna talk,0.03,3.72
about another part of the nervous system,1.829,4.891
that gets affected with high blood,3.75,6.63
glucose or high insulin okay in other,6.72,5.22
videos I've talked about the damage to,10.38,4.02
the brain your memory your cognitive,11.94,4.199
function I talked about peripheral,14.4,3.959
neuropathy which is damage to the nerves,16.139,5.011
in the hands and the feet because high,18.359,4.441
levels of insulin and high levels of,21.15,4.5
sugar destroy the blood vessels that go,22.8,4.08
to the nerves,25.65,3.24
but the autonomic nervous system is,26.88,3.479
another part of the nervous system that,28.89,4.38
is not commonly talked about okay,30.359,5.011
the autonomic nervous system is composed,33.27,4.53
of three different sections you have the,35.37,3.599
sympathetic nerves which is the,37.8,1.77
flight-or-fight,38.969,3.481
you have the parasympathetic nervous,39.57,5.37
system which is responsible for rest and,42.45,5.67
digest and recovering from stress and,44.94,4.86
then you also have the part which is,48.12,3.36
called the enteric which is all the,49.8,3.39
digestion so the autonomic nervous,51.48,4.62
system is that system that works below,53.19,4.65
your conscious awareness,56.1,4.38
it works on automatic so when you have a,57.84,5.28
neuropathy nerve damage of this system,60.48,4.819
you can have a problem with the bladder,63.12,5.19
retention lack of control where you have,65.299,6.07
to wear a diaper leaky valves your,68.31,5.07
genitals could be also affected in,71.369,4.5
potency you can't get an erection you,73.38,5.61
don't have a libido anymore digestion,75.869,5.131
there's a condition called gastroparesis,78.99,4.169
where your stomach just doesn't empty,81.0,5.04
very fast so everything is very slow of,83.159,4.591
course if you have a slow digestive,86.04,3.57
system you're going to end up having,87.75,4.049
constipation because you're not getting,89.61,4.32
the full digestion and then you're gonna,91.799,4.081
have problems with the heart blood,93.93,4.92
pressure either high or low pulse rate,95.88,6.239
either high or low or rhythm problems,98.85,5.58
like atrial fibrillation or heart,102.119,4.5
palpitations you can also have problems,104.43,5.82
with breathing in oxygen exchange as in,106.619,6.901
sleep apnea so the consequence of high,110.25,5.46
sugar and high insulin on the nervous,113.52,5.129
system is quite extensive but the good,115.71,4.799
news about this is that if you can,118.649,3.781
control the sugar and you can lower the,120.509,4.5
insulin you can heal some of these,122.43,5.13
disorders I'm seeing this happen all,125.009,4.321
over the place when you put people on a,127.56,3.929
healthy ketogenic diet and in the minute,129.33,3.57
fasting you,131.489,3.271
see amazing things clear up that you,132.9,3.929
wouldn't necessarily think could clear,134.76,2.46
up,136.829,3.36
you see bladder and prevent improvements,137.22,5.879
with the sex organs great improvements,140.189,5.731
with digestion cardiovascular and the,143.099,5.851
quality of sleep so just because you,145.92,4.86
have these conditions does not mean it's,148.95,4.08
permanent so I put a link down below for,150.78,4.2
those of you that are new to this you,153.03,3.9
definitely need to look into the area of,154.98,5.49
keto and in a min the fasting hey if you,156.93,6.419
