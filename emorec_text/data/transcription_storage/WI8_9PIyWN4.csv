"So the next topic that I'm going to talk
about today is insulin delivery.",5.309,4.531
"The learning objectives for this segment
are name three advantages for",9.84,4.48
"using insulin pens versus syringe,
describe the steps to ensure accuracy",14.32,5.09
"of dose when using an insulin pen,
identify lipohypertrophy and recognize",19.41,5.67
"the importance of injection site rotation,
and list three advantages of pump therapy.",25.08,6.57
"So, there really are three ways for people
at home to deliver insulin.",31.65,5.24
One is through a vial and syringe.,36.89,2.67
"I suspect you are all pretty familiar with
that approach, and some people do",39.56,5.38
"still use vial and syringe, much of it
depends on medical insurance coverage.",44.94,5.09
"There are a few people who feel better
using a syringe and vial,",50.03,4.02
"it's what they learned and it's what they
feel comfortable with.",54.05,2.88
"Most of our patients are now using insulin
pens.",56.93,4.05
"I think that some of the advantages to
using the insulin pen is that they",60.98,4.93
"can be when used properly more accurate
than using a vial and syringe.",65.91,5.55
"They also can provide some discretion when
people eat out in restaurants.",71.46,5.4
"They also provide a more frequent turnover
of the insulin.",76.86,3.56
"So in an insulin pen cartridge there are
300 units versus 1,000 units that",80.42,5.95
"is in each of the insulin vials, so people
tend to start new insulin more often.",86.37,6.528
"It is important to let patients know that
it is okay to keep their",92.898,4.462
insulin at room temperature.,97.36,2.29
"If they have extra insulin, certainly
store that in the refrigerator,",99.65,2.9
"but the insulin that they are currently
using is okay at room temperature.",102.55,5.06
"Many times patients will leave their
insulin at home",107.61,2.94
"rather than bringing it with them to a
restaurant because they're afraid of",110.55,4.0
"having it out of the refrigerator and that
can cause them to miss doses.",114.55,4.74
I am going to show you a couple of,119.29,2.75
"the different pens on the market in a
couple of minutes, and",122.04,2.85
"I'll show you how someone would give an
injection using that insulin pen.",124.89,5.35
"So next we're gonna talk about insulin
pump therapy.",130.24,3.75
"Insulin pump therapy does provide some
advantages.",133.99,5.14
"The insulin pump really is just a
reservoir of insulin that is driven by",139.13,5.3
"a pump into a infusion set and is
controlled by the patient.",144.43,5.72
"So, the insulin pump will deliver a basal
insulin, and",150.15,4.71
"this can be set very precisely to
accommodate the patient's diurnal",154.86,5.47
"patterns and insulin needs much better
than we can do with injected insulin, so",160.33,5.392
that is set and is delivered continuously.,165.722,6.198
"The bolus insulin is controlled by the
patient, so",171.92,3.97
"then the pump becomes a calculator where
the patient has to let the pump know",175.89,5.5
"what the blood sugar is, how many grams of
carbohydrates they are going to eat, and",181.39,4.72
"the pump will calculate based on
pre-programmed ratios and",186.11,5.04
calculations how much insulin is needed.,191.15,4.18
"What's also nice,",195.33,0.89
"is that the pumps nowadays will keep track
of doses that are still out there.",196.22,5.14
"So, assuming that a dose of Humalog,
Novolog,",201.36,4.576
"Apidra, rapid acting insulin will last
about four hours,",205.936,4.164
"this can be programmed so that the pump
remembers when the last dose was.",210.1,4.2
"This helps patients to prevent stacking
insulin and causing hypoglycemia.",214.3,6.53
"So some of the reasons that people like to
wear pumps,",220.83,3.67
is that it can be more convenient.,224.5,2.94
"They can probably get better blood sugar
control just because of the precision of",227.44,5.7
"the basal insulin dosing, the precision of
the bolus dosing,",233.14,5.43
"and also because of the convenience, so
they're less likely to miss injections.",238.57,6.29
"It's easier to give multiple injections at
buffets or times when they eat out",244.86,6.23
"when they don't really know what they're
going to have in their entire meal.",251.09,3.89
"Certainly there are some disadvantages to
wearing the pump.",256.36,3.52
They are expensive.,259.88,1.52
"Most insurance companies will cover an
insulin pump, but",261.4,4.42
"they do require ongoing supplies and we
encourage patients to also",265.82,4.9
"have a backup to be able to give
themselves insulin if for",270.72,3.64
"some reason the pump fails or something
happens to the infusion set.",274.36,4.87
"So there are really three pieces that are
required for the insulin pump.",279.23,5.56
One is the infusion set itself.,284.79,2.84
"Then there is tubing that leads to a
reservoir that patients fill with insulin,",287.63,6.08
and then the pump itself.,293.71,1.79
"There's also an increased risk of ketones
when patients are on a pump,",296.69,5.0
"and the reason for that is that if there
is some problem with the pump,",301.69,5.44
"in other words a pump failure, if there's
a problem with the insulin delivery",307.13,5.23
"into the infusion set, or a problem with
the infusion set, the infusion",312.36,4.87
"sets are generally little plastic
catheters that sit underneath the skin.",317.23,5.27
"You can't see them once their under the
skin and if they become crimped or bent,",322.5,4.63
"the insulin delivery can be interrupted,
and this can lead to a lack of insulin,",327.13,5.66
"which would be the reason that people
would sometimes develop ketones.",332.79,4.84
"and the person, the wearer would not know
that they had that crimp and",337.63,2.63
"that they were not getting the insulin
until their",340.26,2.8
"blood sugars were not responding to the
insulin itself.",343.06,4.76
"So there's a great deal more of
problem-solving that goes into",347.82,4.37
"trying to figure out what is wrong when a
blood sugar rises and",352.19,4.11
"whether it has to do with the pump or if
it has to do with the wrong dose,",356.3,4.58
"the wrong carbohydrate count, illnesses
and stress.",360.88,3.76
"So people who are on pumps don't have that
chunk of insulin that sits underneath",364.64,7.3
"the skin and delivers the insulin to them
continuously through a 24-hour period.",371.94,5.59
"People on pumps can actually develop
ketones really quite rapidly so",377.53,3.75
"just to review, why would somebody develop
ketones?",381.28,3.37
"It could be because the insulin's gone
bad,",384.65,3.36
"could be that there's a problem with their
pump, could be that for",388.01,3.59
"some reason they maybe even just forgot to
put their pump on.",391.6,3.86
"They had a shower, they disconnected, they
left the house and",395.46,3.25
forgot to connect their pump.,398.71,2.64
"So I'm going to show you a couple of the
different pumps that are available on",401.35,4.68
the market.,406.03,0.95
"I think that it requires a fairly savvy
patient to really take",406.98,4.85
"advantage of the options that a pump can
allow, and an experienced provider",411.83,5.68
"to help to figure out what the settings on
the pump should be.",417.51,4.44
"So the last thing I'm gonna cover in this
segment is lipohypertrophy.",421.95,4.58
"Many patients because they do these
injections so",426.53,3.21
"often, get into the habit of injecting
into the same areas.",429.74,4.94
"This can cause scaring kind of fatty
tissue to develop,",434.68,5.15
"and insulin does not absorb very well in
these areas.",439.83,4.0
"So you can see on this picture that in
these areas here is where",443.83,5.19
"this person has been doing their
injections and so it really",449.02,5.64
can cause some kind of swelling to occur.,454.66,5.43
"Those are areas that these will probably
won't absorb very well.",460.09,4.73
"So if you have patients who don't seem to
be responding well to the insulin that",464.82,4.47
"you're increasing the doses but not really
seeing big changes in their blood sugars,",469.29,3.91
that would be the thing to look for.,473.2,1.66
"We've gotten into the habit of looking at
injection sites at every visit and",474.86,4.57
you'll be surprised what you find.,479.43,1.66
"It's really not that hard to recognize
when it's happening, and it's a really",481.09,5.16
"simple way to improve blood sugars pretty
rapidly.",486.25,6.13
"And so now, let's take a look at some of
the injection delivery systems,",492.38,5.957
including the pens and the insulin pumps.,498.337,3.507
"All right, so as I mentioned,",501.844,1.736
"I'd like to show you some of these insulin
delivery devices.",503.58,3.02
"So, the first is the vial and syringe.",506.6,1.77
Everybody has seen that.,508.37,1.96
no mystery there.,510.33,1.805
"The next thing I'm gonna show you are the
insulin pumps, and",512.135,2.86
then we're gonna move to the insulin pens.,514.995,2.93
"So this is just a smattering of three of
the different",517.925,3.34
pumps that are available out there.,521.265,1.49
"There are several others that are also
available.",522.755,2.98
So this is the Medtronic version.,525.735,2.932
"It is the one that can be integrated with
the CGM and",528.667,6.013
"how this works is that a syringe is filled
with insulin by the wearer.",534.68,6.43
That syringe is dropped into the pump.,541.11,2.92
"The tubing then delivers the insulin into
the infusion set that the user",544.03,5.06
"also inserts into their skin, so every
three days, that system is changed out,",549.09,5.775
"and a new set of insulin and insulin set
are put in.",554.865,4.492
"So, now we're gonna look at the insulin
pens.",561.05,3.02
"There are a couple of different insulin
pens.",564.07,2.512
"Some are durable, where the cartridge is
disposed of but",566.582,5.208
"the pen is not and the others are
disposables.",571.79,3.43
"So, let's look at the the durable pen
first.",575.22,2.93
"When the patient picks up their
prescription from the pharmacy,",579.46,2.47
they will get five cartridges of insulin.,581.93,3.66
"In this case this would be Humalog,
generally",585.59,5.36
"all of these cartridges are kept in the
refrigerator, until the patient uses one.",590.95,4.39
"The pen comes apart here, and the
cartridge goes inside.",597.23,4.776
[BLANK_AUDIO],602.006,4.27
"Attached to that then is a pen needle, so",606.276,4.048
"there's a paper back, and that just screws
together.",610.324,5.606
"What's nice about these durable pens is
that they can dial in half-unit dosing,",617.43,5.77
"and for people who are on very small doses
of insulin, that can be helpful.",623.2,4.13
"That could be someone who has been newly
diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes,",627.33,4.575
"who is still making some insulin or could
be someone",631.905,5.3
"who has had diabetes for a very long time
who really doesn't need much insulin.",637.205,4.78
"So, you can see that that's the pen with a
needle on it.",643.035,4.445
"Because it's a mechanical device, we teach
the patients to do an air test",647.48,4.63
"before every dose, to make sure that there
is insulin flowing, and",652.11,4.39
that the insulin pen needle is primed.,656.5,2.97
"In order to dial the dose, I'm just going
to dial on the bottom here",659.47,5.11
"a couple of units, then with the pen,
upright, I'm gonna push on the plunger,",664.58,5.45
"and I wanna see some insulin coming out of
that needle.",670.03,3.86
"So we teach our patients three drops, that
was one and a half,",673.89,4.97
so let's do that again.,678.86,1.88
Two more units.,680.74,0.88
"We wanna see at least three drops of
insulin, so that's a successful air test.",682.892,4.858
We know that this pen's going to work.,687.75,1.9
Now we can dial our dose.,689.65,1.409
"If you listen to the clicks you can hear
how much insulin you're dialing.",692.11,4.81
"This is very helpful for people who have
visual impairments who can't",696.92,4.855
"see a syringe or who have dexterity
problems.",701.775,3.685
"So if you listen, each click is a half of
a unit.",705.46,3.625
[SOUND] So I can count the clicks but,709.085,3.1
"I can also look to see how many units I
have.",712.185,4.001
So I should have two units.,716.186,2.054
"We inject at a 90 degree angle, straight
in to the skin,",718.24,4.58
"push down on the plunger end, that brings
us back to zero, then we count to ten.",723.99,6.32
"And the reason that we count to ten is
that the insulin pens deliver the insulin",730.31,3.62
"a little bit slower than a syringe does
and we don't want that insulin to",733.93,4.3
"leak from the site, so after we've counted
to ten we can pull the needle out.",738.23,5.05
We can cap that needle and remove it.,743.28,3.14
"So that pen is now ready to go for the
next meal.",748.59,3.31
"The disposable pens work much the same
way.",754.87,2.71
"The pharmacy will provide these in a
five-pen pack, so four pens go in",759.0,4.56
"the fridge, one that you're using is good
at room temperature for a month.",763.56,3.63
"Taking the lid off of that, the needle
goes on the very same way,",768.72,6.603
"two caps,",775.323,6.357
"again we're going to dial to make sure
that the pen is working.",781.68,6.87
"This is the air shot, two units.",788.55,2.55
"And now remember that this pen is dialing
in one unit increments so",791.1,4.1
each click on this pen is one unit.,795.2,3.25
"So pushing on the plunger, I wanna see
those three drops, and I do.",798.45,4.73
Then I can dial my dose.,804.62,1.96
"So that's one, two, three, four units.",806.58,4.498
"Same thing, 90 degrees, push the insulin
in,",811.078,6.732
"that brings us back to zero, we count to
ten and we pull the needle out.",817.81,4.41
That is how the insulin pens work.,825.05,2.42
"It's important to use them correctly
because you can get",827.47,3.81
"incorrect dosing if you don't follow all
of the steps.",831.28,3.55
"And people really appreciate using the
pens because they're easy.",834.83,3.213
