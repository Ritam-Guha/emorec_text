hey folks I just want to talk about the,4.91,4.75
glycemic index real quick it's created,7.26,3.75
by a nutritionist of researchers in the,9.66,2.49
80s who are looking for a more accurate,11.01,3.6
way to describe carbohydrates of,12.15,3.659
different food groups rather than just,14.61,2.58
comparing the total number of carbs,15.809,3.3
which is generally considered to be,17.19,4.079
inaccurate as far as how its impact on,19.109,5.58
the human metabolism and so this,21.269,5.221
glycemic index compares different,24.689,3.84
carbohydrates and then the way that it,26.49,3.359
evaluates them is based on how much it,28.529,3.691
brings up your blood sugar so they'll,29.849,5.131
take you know a tablespoon of sugar a,32.22,5.61
piece of white bread a piece of grain,34.98,5.46
bread a muffin whatever glass of milk,37.83,4.38
and then they'll compare all of those,40.44,3.48
based on how high they raise your blood,42.21,3.96
sugar so how are the glycemic index the,43.92,3.42
more increases your blood sugar that's,46.17,3.63
pretty intuitive so in general you could,47.34,3.96
say the lower the glycemic index the,49.8,2.76
better generally there's three,51.3,4.29
categories high medium and low things,52.56,4.95
that are high or greater than 70 things,55.59,4.17
that are lower less than 55 so again the,57.51,4.29
lower the better and then the usefulness,59.76,4.08
of this index is it sort of allows you,61.8,3.78
to easily compare different types of,63.84,3.27
carbohydrates regardless of whether,65.58,3.69
they're simple or complex just sort of,67.11,4.499
across-the-board standardizes them so,69.27,4.379
there's there is some evidence to back,71.609,4.62
up the use of the glycemic index there's,73.649,4.08
strong evidence to suggest that diets,76.229,3.261
rich in food with a high glycemic index,77.729,3.99
are associated with an increased risk of,79.49,4.269
diabetes as well as increased,81.719,3.51
triglycerides and insulin resistance,83.759,4.61
which is like sort of pre-diabetes,85.229,5.731
also there's evidence that says that low,88.369,4.96
glycemic index actually can reduce the,90.96,4.109
risk of developing diabetes can reduce,93.329,4.021
the risk of macular degeneration as well,95.069,5.37
as coronary heart disease so it's,97.35,5.939
definitely important to understand and,100.439,5.28
it's a good way to compare carbs so one,103.289,4.32
limitation of the glycemic index is that,105.719,3.121
it does not account for the amount of,107.609,3.69
carbohydrates consumed just the type so,108.84,5.61
that's important to recognize and then,111.299,4.92
it's utility and mixed meals and,114.45,3.869
long-term studies are a couple of the,116.219,4.56
factors that limit its utility so you,118.319,3.631
don't always see people talk about the,120.779,2.971
glycemic index and that's sort of,121.95,4.11
why you may also hear about the glycemic,123.75,4.92
load that's sort of the next the second,126.06,4.68
generation glycemic index basically what,128.67,3.21
that does it adjusts for both the,130.74,3.36
quantity and the quality of the,131.88,3.3
carbohydrates that you're going to,134.1,2.55
consume whereas the guy stomach index,135.18,3.45
only adjusts for quality it doesn't,136.65,5.19
factor in the quantity the usefulness to,138.63,5.13
physicians and population at large is,141.84,3.36
sort of debated about the glycemic load,143.76,3.33
but you can still use it to guide your,145.2,4.86
food choices and then the rule for,147.09,4.83
either of these which you'll see more,150.06,3.66
often will be the glycemic index the,151.92,3.39
rule for both them is simple the lower,153.72,3.66
the better for sure so just keep that in,155.31,4.77
mind lower glycemic index is better on a,157.38,4.41
table on the left you see low glycemic,160.08,3.15
index foods on the right you see high,161.79,4.23
and so just to give you a sense there's,163.23,4.77
obviously a lot more that could followed,166.02,3.27
either these categories but you can take,168.0,2.4
a chance here and look at some of these,169.29,4.08
you know oatmeal pumpernickel sweet,170.4,4.44
potatoes skim milk those are low,173.37,3.69
glycemic index foods on the right side,174.84,4.02
is the instant rice french fries soda,177.06,4.77
crackers but mashed potatoes ice cream,178.86,4.26
you know those things really drive your,181.83,2.25
blood sugar up so those are high,183.12,2.82
glycemic index foods so it's good to,184.08,3.24
understand that and hopefully this was,185.94,3.41
helpful,187.32,2.03
