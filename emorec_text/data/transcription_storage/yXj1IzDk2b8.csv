hello everyone and welcome back to,0.48,3.12
clinical cousins youtube channel where,1.839,5.281
today we're going to be going over nph,3.6,6.88
insulin also known as humulin n,7.12,6.0
this is classified as an intermediate,10.48,5.119
acting insulin and is given for diabetes,13.12,5.239
mellitus 1 and 2 and general,15.599,4.401
hyperglycemia,18.359,5.241
now you cannot take this drug or insulin,20.0,6.08
with alcohol or if your patient has,23.6,3.999
hypoglycemia,26.08,3.92
and this drug has not been proven to be,27.599,4.0
safe in pregnancy,30.0,4.399
now what we need to know is that this,31.599,5.441
drug binds to the transmembrane,34.399,5.761
receptors and starts a cascade of,37.04,5.519
actions that eventually result in the,40.16,6.559
placement of glute4 transporters into,42.559,6.0
the cell membrane,46.719,5.281
this allows glucose to enter the cells,48.559,5.68
by facilitated diffusion,52.0,5.199
this also means that the glucose level,54.239,4.401
in the plasma,57.199,3.2
will decrease,58.64,4.559
now it is very important that we also,60.399,5.521
know that insulin has another very,63.199,4.321
important action,65.92,4.8
it will make potassium leave the blood,67.52,5.599
and enter our cells,70.72,5.12
insulin activates a chain of reactions,73.119,4.161
that eventually,75.84,6.16
stimulate our sodium potassium atpases,77.28,6.72
these atp aces,82.0,5.759
push sodium out of the cell and bring,84.0,6.159
potassium in the cell,87.759,4.801
this is very important because food has,90.159,5.28
a lot of potassium if our bodies were to,92.56,5.28
just simply absorb all this potassium,95.439,5.04
and do nothing about it it may cause us,97.84,5.44
to have paralytic and potentially fatal,100.479,4.161
arrhythmias,103.28,4.4
this is why it is a smart idea to intake,104.64,7.439
glucose and potassium at the same time,107.68,6.24
you should be aware that your patient's,112.079,4.64
insulin need will increase as their body,113.92,6.159
experiences stressors like surgery,116.719,6.481
sickness trauma and fever,120.079,5.36
also be aware of the possibility of,123.2,4.6
developing a temporary,125.439,5.841
hypokalemia with insulin administration,127.8,6.439
now we should also know that this drug,131.28,6.319
will begin to work in about one hour,134.239,6.881
it will have a peak effect or a,137.599,4.921
very low,141.12,5.199
hypoglycemic effect at 8 hours and it,142.52,6.439
will last for 24 hours,146.319,4.081
some of the common side effects of this,148.959,3.721
medication may include,150.4,4.08
hypoglycemia,152.68,4.36
pallor and tachycardia,154.48,3.839
weight gain,157.04,2.08
and,158.319,4.161
lipo hypertrophy at the injection site,159.12,5.52
some commonly tested material about this,162.48,6.16
medication is that its address is 1 8,164.64,8.08
24. meaning that it will take an hour to,168.64,7.92
work meaning the onset is an hour,172.72,8.08
it will have a peak hypoglycemic effect,176.56,7.84
at 8 hours and it will last or have,180.8,7.68
effects for a total of 24 hours,184.4,5.199
now,188.48,2.56
it's always important when you're,189.599,3.841
administering insulin to monitor for,191.04,4.559
both hypoglycemia,193.44,2.96
and,195.599,3.121
hypokalemia,196.4,3.68
