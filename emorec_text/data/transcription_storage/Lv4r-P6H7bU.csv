all right so our next topic is blood,0.48,3.52
sugar,3.04,3.68
and this is a really popular one with,4.0,4.639
all the clients that i talk to because i,6.72,3.28
feel like when i started,8.639,3.521
in my practice 10 years ago when i would,10.0,3.36
talk to people about their blood,12.16,2.0
pressure,13.36,2.72
they may or may not have known what it,14.16,3.6
was and it was kind of like,16.08,4.88
oh my friend over there has diabetes and,17.76,5.359
now i feel like it's everybody knows,20.96,4.239
somebody who's diabetic,23.119,5.121
um you know it's all over the place so,25.199,4.721
blood sugar is something that is really,28.24,3.68
really concerning in most diets,29.92,3.76
regardless of where you live,31.92,4.96
how old you are um blood sugar is a big,33.68,3.84
issue,36.88,2.32
now we do think about blood sugar when,37.52,3.199
it comes to diabetes,39.2,3.92
and basically what happens is when you,40.719,3.68
eat,43.12,4.32
carbohydrates or sugar of any sort that,44.399,4.48
goes through your digestive system,47.44,4.24
pretty quickly and then once it hits,48.879,4.081
your bloodstream,51.68,3.68
it acts like no other nutrient does,52.96,4.0
proteins fat they kind of take their,55.36,3.6
time getting into your bloodstream,56.96,4.239
but carbohydrates hit it immediately and,58.96,3.84
you have that immediate rise,61.199,4.561
in blood sugar then what happens is you,62.8,5.28
get this signal sent to your pancreas,65.76,5.44
and your pancreas releases insulin and,68.08,5.6
insulin is a hormone so it's released it,71.2,4.559
takes all that blood sugar swooshes it,73.68,4.799
into your cells where your cells then,75.759,4.481
use that blood sugar,78.479,3.28
to do the things they need to do help,80.24,3.519
give you energy help you focus when,81.759,3.04
you're at work,83.759,3.281
um all those things that we think of,84.799,4.161
that carbohydrates actually do that are,87.04,3.119
good for us,88.96,4.4
however the problem is again,90.159,6.96
we get too much there we have diets that,93.36,4.719
are way too high,97.119,4.32
in sugar way too high in refined carbs,98.079,6.481
therefore our pancreas just kind of gets,101.439,5.441
tired and it's not able to produce as,104.56,3.76
much insulin as it needs,106.88,4.4
it's not able to keep up and so what,108.32,3.52
happens,111.28,2.96
is that blood sugar is then stored as,111.84,3.2
fat,114.24,3.28
in the body and eventually your pancreas,115.04,3.439
just starts,117.52,3.12
not working as well as it should that's,118.479,4.081
when somebody tends to go on insulin,120.64,2.88
that's when,122.56,4.239
um you get the diagnosis of diabetes,123.52,6.4
so it's really important to know,126.799,6.001
what your blood sugar levels are kind of,129.92,4.48
where you're at,132.8,4.56
and you know i know that there's a lot,134.4,4.0
of people out there and you start to,137.36,2.72
feel like well i can do this i can live,138.4,3.6
with diabetes and you can,140.08,4.799
but the goal would be to not go on,142.0,5.12
medication with diabetes that you can,144.879,4.0
actually control it with your diet and,147.12,2.56
exercise,148.879,1.761
which you're probably going to get,149.68,3.04
really tired of hearing me say that you,150.64,3.28
could deal with things with diet and,152.72,1.92
exercise,153.92,3.679
but it's true and you know of course,154.64,4.56
there is the genetic factor and i'm,157.599,3.121
going to talk about that next,159.2,4.08
but when you look at it you really want,160.72,3.36
to try,163.28,2.64
to live a lifestyle that's going to,164.08,3.12
allow you to not,165.92,3.599
put all your money into maintaining your,167.2,3.84
health and medication,169.519,3.681
instead taking that money and putting in,171.04,3.919
a place that is going to help,173.2,4.48
you be healthier it's going to allow you,174.959,4.481
to exercise you can,177.68,4.96
get the access to exercise access to,179.44,5.6
healthy foods supplements that you need,182.64,4.48
all those things instead of putting all,185.04,3.199
your money,187.12,3.759
at the pharmacy so again blood sugar,188.239,3.681
very important thing,190.879,3.201
know your numbers when it comes to that,191.92,3.44
and know that you can control it with,194.08,5.76
diet and exercise,195.36,4.48
