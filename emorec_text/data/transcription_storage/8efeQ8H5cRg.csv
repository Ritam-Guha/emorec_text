Northern Ireland have a genetic variant,15.72,4.68
which affects DNA methylation and this,17.64,4.5
predisposes them to higher blood,20.4,5.039
pressure these people have around a 20%,22.14,5.97
greater chance of cardiovascular disease,25.439,4.701
than those who fight the genetic variant,28.11,4.83
we are working with professor Mary Ward,30.14,4.72
at the Northern Ireland Centre for food,32.94,2.58
and health,34.86,3.57
his latest research has shown that the B,35.52,5.49
vitamin riboflavin can significantly,38.43,4.86
lower blood pressure in people with this,41.01,4.92
genetic variant I write with flavin,43.29,5.1
influences hypertension is not clear but,45.93,3.96
it is a part that there are other,48.39,4.74
factors at play in our Northern Ireland,49.89,5.01
chest heart and strokes on the project,53.13,3.69
we want to see if there are any,54.9,4.74
differences in DNA methylation between,56.82,4.59
people with the genetic risk factor,59.64,3.96
compared to those who fight and we also,61.41,4.709
want to see if riboflavin has any effect,63.6,5.879
on DNA methylation and these people to,66.119,5.971
do this we are going to analyze blood,69.479,6.121
samples from people taken before and,72.09,5.73
after a six-week supplementation of,75.6,4.74
riboflavin we already have these blood,77.82,4.95
samples back we've determined the,80.34,5.51
genotype of the people who have given us,82.77,5.66
we're excited by our early results which,85.85,4.8
indeed show that DNA methylation is,88.43,3.51
Alderton people who have taken,90.65,3.3
riboflavin and who have this genetic,91.94,4.289
variation through our Nixa funder,93.95,4.71
project we're going to widen our search,96.229,4.921
to look at more genes we hope that this,98.66,4.05
project will provide important,101.15,4.859
information on our diet and genes and,102.71,6.299
how this influences hypertension we hope,106.009,4.681
that this research will provide the,109.009,3.451
basis for new and more effective,110.69,5.03
treatments for hypertension,112.46,3.26
