hello its Lisa here from pens and I'm,3.53,5.55
going to demonstrate for you how to use,6.56,5.249
the trusty of a pen properly so the,9.08,4.889
first thing I want you to do is take the,11.809,5.941
pen cap off and we are then going to get,13.969,7.921
an alcohol way and I want you to wipe,17.75,7.699
the tip of the pen needle off to be as,21.89,6.51
sterile as possible and then what you're,25.449,4.42
going to do is grab your pen needle,28.4,3.81
there's a little blue paper tab on the,29.869,4.531
outside of the needle I just want you to,32.21,5.58
pull that tab off there there is an,34.4,6.54
outer pen needle and an inner pen needle,37.79,5.82
cap so what you're going to do is just,40.94,5.939
take the needle and kind of press and,43.61,7.5
then turn clockwise until that it stops,46.879,6.0
turning and then you're going to take,51.11,4.62
the outer pen needle off and just place,52.879,4.891
it on the table near you you know the,55.73,2.82
inner pen needle,57.77,4.05
I want you then to take the inner pen,58.55,5.789
needle off and immediately discard this,61.82,4.98
so that you don't accidentally try to,64.339,3.871
recap the needle and prick yourself,66.8,3.929
because that wouldn't be fun and what,68.21,4.589
you're going to do is give yourself an,70.729,3.661
air shot and the reason we're doing that,72.799,3.511
is just to make sure that the pen needle,74.39,3.269
is clear and you're going to get the,76.31,3.48
right dose of insulin so what you do is,77.659,3.78
you just put your what you're going to,79.79,4.98
do first is dial in two units on the pen,81.439,6.031
dial put your thumb on the little white,84.77,5.489
button here point it away from you as,87.47,4.35
you don't make so that we score yourself,90.259,4.081
and just press until you hear the little,91.82,4.47
clip to know that the dose is done and,94.34,4.02
you should see one to two drops of,96.29,3.57
insulin come through the tip of the,98.36,3.689
needle so so that you know we're good,99.86,4.5
now what you're going to do is dial in,102.049,4.261
the correct dose of insulin that you,104.36,5.009
need at that time so for example let's,106.31,5.28
say I'm going to dial in four units of,109.369,4.381
insulin so I'm at the number four on the,111.59,5.04
pen dial you're going to hold the pen,113.75,6.6
like a dagger and put your finger on the,116.63,5.76
little white button there for today's,120.35,3.39
purposes I'm going to use this little,122.39,4.079
cushion here to give the insulin,123.74,4.469
normally you might want to pinch a,126.469,3.24
little bit the pen needles are really,128.209,3.341
short which makes it nice these,129.709,4.181
is to use the pen needle that's the,131.55,4.71
shortest so you're going to pinch and,133.89,5.16
then what you do is just pop the pen in,136.26,6.0
and press the wait button at the end of,139.05,6.69
the pen until you hear the click once,142.26,4.62
you hear the click you know that the,145.74,3.12
correct dose of insulin has been given,146.88,4.68
and at that time I want you to count to,148.86,5.25
10 to make sure that you get the full,151.56,5.19
dose and there's no leak back so sing a,154.11,4.74
song or count one one thousand two one,156.75,4.44
thousand till you get to ten and then,158.85,4.65
take the pen needle out and then what,161.19,5.37
you're going to do is grab the outer pen,163.5,4.89
needle that we talked about earlier and,166.56,5.37
just pop it on to the pen needle you,168.39,5.34
kind of need to squeeze it a little bit,171.93,3.78
and then turn it counterclockwise until,173.73,4.17
it comes off and then you're going to,175.71,5.34
immediately discard it in a sharps,177.9,6.6
container and then you're going to recap,181.05,6.54
your pen and that's it for today's,184.5,5.82
demonstration of the trace eva pen hope,187.59,5.81
to see you in pen soon,190.32,3.08
