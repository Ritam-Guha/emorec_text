polycystic ovaries is sort of a,3.49,7.63
multi-symptom disease process and I,7.729,5.551
think for for many years was was very,11.12,7.44
misunderstood or under diagnosed the,13.28,6.72
most common symptom of polycystic,18.56,5.1
ovaries is irregular periods patients,20.0,6.41
will skip periods for months at a time,23.66,8.16
or weeks you know go into 45 days beyond,26.41,7.81
45 days 3 months 6 months at a time,31.82,5.22
they'll skip periods and then when they,34.22,6.96
have them they can be fairly heavy it's,37.04,6.24
also a disease process where we think,41.18,4.92
insulin resistance um plays a role we,43.28,6.95
see some abnormal hair growth we see,46.1,7.2
some skin changes associated with it we,50.23,5.649
see acne so there's a variety of,53.3,5.43
different symptoms that that can present,55.879,6.241
that might patient off to recognizing,58.73,5.539
that maybe there's a problem here,62.12,5.64
certainly if if you're not ovulating and,64.269,6.311
triggering a period then it also can be,67.76,5.22
difficult to attain a pregnancy because,70.58,5.07
you certainly have less opportunities in,72.98,6.23
a year's time period to to get pregnant,75.65,7.59
and it's estimated right now that,79.21,5.89
upwards of 15 percent of women in the,83.24,5.64
United States probably have some variety,85.1,6.51
of polycystic ovaries it's a large,88.88,4.86
number and I think that's consistent,91.61,4.86
with what I see in my practice for the,93.74,5.82
most part you know polycystic ovaries is,96.47,5.88
not dangerous to people um it's a,99.56,5.03
problem that needs to be simply managed,102.35,5.58
so if people have irregular periods and,104.59,6.13
have some of these other symptoms they,107.93,5.7
should see their gynecologist and have a,110.72,5.31
discussion about trying to determine,113.63,5.61
what is the cause of their irregular,116.03,6.6
periods kind of the old adage that oh I,119.24,5.07
didn't get my period I must have been,122.63,4.23
stressed is really not an accurate,124.31,4.35
assessment of,126.86,4.17
people's problems and so if people are,128.66,5.46
regularly skipping periods they should,131.03,4.83
be seen by a physician they should be,134.12,4.95
evaluated because if left untreated over,135.86,5.13
years and years it is a problem that,139.07,4.5
that can give people some issues down,140.99,6.3
the road such as you know premature,143.57,6.42
coronary disease it can cause you know,147.29,6.18
diabetes or not cause diabetes but it,149.99,7.2
can be a pre pre symptom to someone who,153.47,6.66
may develop diabetes and and certainly,157.19,6.27
in a material cancer if people go years,160.13,6.39
and years and years without regulation,163.46,5.07
of their cycles um it can promote the,166.52,4.32
risk of endometrial cancer and so it is,168.53,4.47
a problem that should be managed it,170.84,4.41
should be evaluated and then a,173.0,3.75
discussion and understanding of the,175.25,3.15
disease process between the patient and,176.75,4.31
the physician the treatment really is,178.4,6.96
management of the ill effects of the,181.06,7.93
disease process so if one of the,185.36,7.32
problems is that I have some insulin,188.99,6.6
resistance then certainly changing diet,192.68,8.61
and exercise and weight loss can prolong,195.59,8.369
or decrease the chance that someone,201.29,5.64
might develop diabetes down the road the,203.959,4.951
regulation of the cycles through a,206.93,6.93
variety of medications can prevent the,208.91,8.549
risk of endometrial cancer over time and,213.86,7.28
so the treatments don't fix the problem,217.459,6.571
necessarily the treatments really are,221.14,6.58
designed to manage the problem so that,224.03,6.69
people don't have long term ill effects,227.72,6.18
of it the the easiest and best way to,230.72,5.22
probably try to reverse some of the,233.9,4.2
effects of polycystic ovaries is through,235.94,5.15
good diet and weight loss,238.1,2.99
