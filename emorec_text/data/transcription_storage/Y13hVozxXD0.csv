hi guys I had another question from,0.03,2.879
someone that wanted to know why is,1.5,4.92
having high blood sugars bad for us okay,2.909,6.15
it's really two main reasons with a lot,6.42,5.91
of secondary reasons - one is that and,9.059,4.981
I'm gonna start with number 2 micro,12.33,2.939
hemorrhaging of the vessels are,14.04,3.48
basically tiny little leaks okay like,15.269,4.321
your your blood vessels are leaking,17.52,4.259
blood so what's gonna happen is your,19.59,3.54
body's gonna then try to patch it up,21.779,4.891
with a type of protein called fibrin so,23.13,5.069
you can have high levels of fiber gin,26.67,3.3
when your sugars are high and that's,28.199,4.831
what what gives you sticky blood okay if,29.97,5.46
from that you get clots clots in the,33.03,4.92
arteries which create a stroke hardening,35.43,4.23
of the arteries high blood pressure,37.95,4.019
because you lose the elasticity and then,39.66,4.44
loss of vision where you have the retina,41.969,3.93
being destroyed you also get cirrhosis,44.1,3.959
of the liver so we get micro hemorrhage,45.899,4.201
and then the Fabra Djinn and number,48.059,4.261
three you can get a fatty liver so I had,50.1,4.139
this guy come in one day and I had him,52.32,3.48
lay on the table and I'm chucking him,54.239,4.081
and he told me his hands and his legs,55.8,5.04
just got completely dead they're numb he,58.32,4.53
can't even feel them and but he's not,60.84,3.84
really concerned about that because when,62.85,3.54
he sits up and he could just kind of tap,64.68,3.99
it and it comes back to life so I says,66.39,5.67
what are you eating okay so not only,68.67,6.51
does he eat pancakes every morning but,72.06,6.629
he consumes an entire glass of syrup,75.18,6.27
okay he puts all the syrup on there high,78.689,5.401
fructose corn syrup and that's just his,81.45,3.989
breakfast I don't want to tell you what,84.09,3.24
his lunch and dinner is it's just pure,85.439,4.201
sugar and this guy was a pre-diabetic,87.33,5.64
and he wasn't even interested in,89.64,5.79
changing his diet he would kind of come,92.97,4.32
in just for some relief with his back,95.43,3.66
about six months later I go in my office,97.29,3.36
I opened the door and there is with his,99.09,5.13
sister with these dark glasses on with a,100.65,8.16
little cane completely blind okay micro,104.22,7.8
hemorrhage Fabra gin because he didn't,108.81,5.309
take care of his high sugars so here's a,112.02,4.5
situation that can be totally avoided if,114.119,3.6
he would have done something about it,116.52,4.08
three things get rid of this sugar two,117.719,6.211
in a minute fasting and if you have any,120.6,5.1
of these symptoms start taking an enzyme,123.93,4.23
called Sarah pet taste at about a,125.7,4.369
hundred and fifty thousand I,128.16,4.64
that will clean up some of the scar,130.069,4.861
tissue that's in the arteries alright,132.8,3.63
thanks for watching,134.93,4.02
hey thank you so much for watching keep,136.43,6.199
spreading the word and share this video,138.95,3.679
