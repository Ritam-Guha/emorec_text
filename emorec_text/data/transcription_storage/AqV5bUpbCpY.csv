why does a very low carb diet sometimes,3.38,9.25
give a higher blood glucose reading the,7.649,6.691
question being sometimes you're led to,12.63,2.879
believe that if you go on a low,14.34,4.62
carbohydrate diet that your diabetes,15.509,7.201
will be treated forever well if you it's,18.96,5.46
true if you lower the carbohydrates you,22.71,3.84
basically stabilize insulin but what,24.42,4.89
happens you push them way down well the,26.55,5.28
brain needs carbohydrates and it gets,29.31,5.249
desperate up there so what it does it,31.83,5.34
calls out for extra carbohydrates by,34.559,4.711
sending out a signal to the pink to the,37.17,4.68
adrenal glands to put secrete more,39.27,5.699
cortisol cortisol will break down your,41.85,5.88
muscle to make glucose the brains happy,44.969,4.801
you're losing muscle mass but the brain,47.73,4.68
is happy but as you have more cortisol,49.77,4.71
up there what happens you develop,52.41,4.05
insulin resistance and now blood sugar,54.48,4.829
levels begin to rise again so that's why,56.46,5.31
when you talk about hormones you cannot,59.309,5.371
talk about any one hormone in absence of,61.77,5.31
how other hormones affect it so if I,64.68,5.369
push you know insulin to low the body,67.08,5.91
responds by pushing up cortisol and what,70.049,5.57
this course I'll do it makes you fatter,72.99,7.41
sicker and dumber so of that's why you,75.619,6.341
have to basically that's why I call the,80.4,5.46
zone diet there are zones it's a matter,81.96,6.81
of balancing and of once you basically,85.86,5.07
say what kind of Bounce I have protein,88.77,3.779
carb right and fat I'm going to try to,90.93,3.99
find the best balance that can keep all,92.549,5.03
my hormones which are directly or,94.92,5.73
indirectly affected by the foods we eat,97.579,5.981
in that therapeutic zone and the best,100.65,4.95
way no you you're in that zone you're,103.56,5.72
simply not hungry throughout the day,105.6,3.68
