I'm David Adams and I'm professor of,5.71,4.53
surgery at the Medical University of,8.65,3.45
South Carolina and co-director of the,10.24,4.08
digestive disease center I've been here,12.1,5.4
for 30 years and my practice has been,14.32,5.48
taking care of people with complicated,17.5,5.31
disorders of their abdomen and the,19.8,5.439
organs that lie inside the abdominal,22.81,5.46
cavity one of the organs that can be,25.239,6.241
really pain just a terrible cause of,28.27,6.36
suffering is the stomach and what I'm,31.48,5.34
talking about today are patients who,34.63,4.979
have stomachs that stopped working for a,36.82,6.12
variety of reasons we call this gastric,39.609,5.581
paris's and it means paralysis of the,42.94,5.459
stomach it occurs frequently in patients,45.19,7.47
who have diabetes and it also occurs for,48.399,6.68
reasons that we don't understand,52.66,4.649
sometimes we think there may be some,55.079,4.631
viral illness that causes a dysfunction,57.309,5.12
but it shows up in a large number of,59.71,5.54
women in the middle years of their life,62.429,5.441
most patients with gastric Parris's can,65.25,4.57
be managed with a variety of medicines,67.87,5.88
but there's some patients in whom all,69.82,6.119
the medicines in the world are given to,73.75,5.34
and they continue to have debilitating,75.939,7.021
nausea vomiting and frequently have,79.09,6.87
weight loss which may require feeding,82.96,6.57
with feeding tubes or even intravenous,85.96,6.269
feeding it's possible to correct this,89.53,4.71
condition when medical treatment fails,92.229,4.771
with a surgical procedure which involves,94.24,5.269
putting a pacemaker into the stomach,97.0,5.31
similar to what you do for a heart that,99.509,4.691
has a malfunction in its electrical,102.31,5.46
system Medtronic has developed this,104.2,7.589
system and what it is it's a small disc,107.77,6.9
shape generator it has a battery in it,111.789,5.94
that gets placed underneath the skin and,114.67,7.309
it's connected by wires into the stomach,117.729,7.261
there are two leads that get placed into,121.979,5.021
the wall of the stomach and they,124.99,4.5
stimulate the electrical system of the,127.0,4.71
stomach with an intermittent pulse of,129.49,5.31
electricity in many patients this is,131.71,6.06
miraculous they may wake up from surgery,134.8,4.87
in nausea which is,137.77,4.95
and present for years is suddenly gone,139.67,6.0
they are able to eat they were able to,142.72,6.76
get off of feeding tubes intravenous,145.67,6.63
feeding it can really be life-changing,149.48,6.99
for many patients in particular young,152.3,6.75
diabetics seem to do very well with this,156.47,5.43
procedure because the electrical signal,159.05,6.3
seems to interrupt the signals that give,161.9,8.43
them nausea so that a young diabetic,165.35,8.1
patient who spends his days and weeks in,170.33,5.939
and out of the emergency room for poo,173.45,6.89
poor blood sugar control for dehydration,176.269,7.621
suddenly is able to take a diet where,180.34,6.52
they can control their diabetes where,183.89,5.84
they can nourish themselves by mouth and,186.86,6.629
avoid the repetitive visits to emergency,189.73,7.089
rooms and hospitalizations we've been,193.489,7.53
doing this at MUSC for over five years,196.819,7.941
that have done over a hundred patients,201.019,7.231
and it doesn't work in everyone some,204.76,6.9
patients it's effective immediately,208.25,6.299
others it may take two to three months,211.66,5.859
for the electrical architecture of the,214.549,4.981
stomach to remodel so that they benefit,217.519,7.081
from it the Pacers are run by a small,219.53,8.37
battery and for patients who have the,224.6,6.12
Pacers effective at a low setting the,227.9,5.0
battery may last for six to eight years,230.72,6.21
other patients require running the,232.9,6.76
generator at high settings and the,236.93,5.82
generators in that case may run out in a,239.66,7.049
year's time sometimes even less when the,242.75,6.51
battery runs out of juice it's an,246.709,5.12
outpatient procedure to replace it,249.26,5.55
patients come in to the hospital go to,251.829,6.31
the operating room and in a 30 minute,254.81,6.899
procedure we remove the generator and,258.139,6.361
replace it with a new one I think,261.709,6.241
the placement of a gastric stimulator,264.5,7.08
can be a life-saving,267.95,7.05
procedure for many patients who have not,271.58,5.369
benefited from traditional medical,275.0,4.919
therapy it definitely can improve the,276.949,7.171
quality of life and it's a procedure,279.919,7.74
that has a low complication rate low,284.12,7.41
risk rate and I'm very pleased that we,287.659,6.121
can offer it here in South Carolina to,291.53,4.919
many patients who need it and many,293.78,4.47
patients who may not be aware that it's,296.449,4.56
available and that is a possible,298.25,6.21
solution to what could be years of,301.009,8.31
nausea vomiting malnutrition and need,304.46,7.859
for multiple emergency room and hospital,309.319,5.211
visits,312.319,2.211
