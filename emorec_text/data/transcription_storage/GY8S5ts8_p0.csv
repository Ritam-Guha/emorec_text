some of the diagnostic tests you may,3.77,5.829
encounter when diagnosing diabetes the,6.33,5.189
first time the first diagnostic test,9.599,3.511
that we've noted in this case was a,11.519,4.77
c-peptide Pro insulin which is produced,13.11,5.16
by the pancreas is cleaved into insulin,16.289,4.83
and c-peptide both are then secreted,18.27,4.58
from the pancreas into the bloodstream,21.119,4.801
when you see a high level of C peptide,22.85,6.099
in the in the blood usually this implies,25.92,6.089
that the body is producing insulin so in,28.949,5.281
response to high blood glucose the,32.009,4.261
pancreas will produce insulin and in,34.23,4.169
conjunction with it it will produce the,36.27,6.09
peptide a low level of C peptide implies,38.399,7.621
that there is a low or even absent level,42.36,5.85
of insulin produced by the body and this,46.02,4.23
is the type of manifestation that you're,48.21,4.64
likely to encounter in type 1 diabetes,50.25,5.28
ketone bodies acetoacetate and,52.85,5.29
beta-hydroxybutyrate as well as acetone,55.53,5.009
are the hallmarks of the metabolic,58.14,5.55
acidosis that is encountered in usually,60.539,5.131
type 1 but also potentially in type 2,63.69,4.499
diabetes when you see these ketone,65.67,4.949
bodies in the urine and more alarmingly,68.189,4.68
in the blood stream this usually implies,70.619,3.901
that the patient has a metabolic,72.869,4.171
acidosis due to the production of excess,74.52,5.16
ketone bodies it also implies a,77.04,5.7
decreased insulin State and is actually,79.68,5.52
one of the Emergencies associated with,82.74,4.29
diabetes mellitus that we will discuss a,85.2,5.82
little bit later in the lecture finally,87.03,6.06
some of the auto antibodies we mentioned,91.02,5.809
in the immune forms of type 1 diabetes a,93.09,7.95
gad65 and an ia 2 antibody can sometimes,96.829,6.04
also be used for confirmation of the,101.04,3.439
diagnosis of type 1 diabetes,102.869,5.061
interestingly enough antibodies to gad65,104.479,6.521
persists longer than those of two islet,107.93,5.829
cells in the case of ia 2 after the,111.0,5.189
development of diabetes and may be a,113.759,5.79
better test to diagnose immune related,116.189,7.981
type 1 diabetes in type 1 diabetes you,119.549,6.241
usually see this in the setting of,124.17,3.289
insulin deficiency,125.79,4.8
about 5% of the diagnosis of diabetes,127.459,4.841
are associated with type 1,130.59,4.41
diabetes underlying mechanisms are,132.3,4.23
destruction of insulin producing,135.0,4.41
pancreatic beta-cells and clinical,136.53,4.47
manifestations we can usually at around,139.41,5.07
80 to 90 percent destruction these as,141.0,5.76
mentioned can be autoimmune or immune,144.48,5.07
mediated they can be idiopathic or they,146.76,4.56
can be acquired from infiltrative,149.55,4.7
conditions such as hemochromatosis,151.32,5.07
typically it affects children and,154.25,4.42
adolescents in the age range of five to,156.39,4.8
fifteen there is an image that,158.67,4.71
accompanies the slide that shows a young,161.19,4.32
girl with the manifestations of,163.38,5.28
dehydration you can see her eyes sunken,165.51,3.93
inner orbits,168.66,4.02
she has pallor she's wasted and thin,169.44,5.31
which is a feature of her type 1,172.68,4.65
diabetes and if you look closely at her,174.75,4.71
rib cage you can see that the clinical,177.33,4.71
sign of intercostal recession this is,179.46,5.97
usually manifested by children who have,182.04,5.82
respiratory distress so in the setting,185.43,3.99
of this constellation of clinical,187.86,3.66
findings one would want to work up this,189.42,3.75
patient for the presence of diabetic,191.52,5.939
ketoacidosis autoimmune mediated type 1,193.17,5.97
diabetes is usually a disease of,197.459,4.201
children and young than adults but it,199.14,5.31
can occur at any age or body mass index,201.66,5.76
range the initial presentation ranges,204.45,5.16
from minor elevations in glucose levels,207.42,5.85
to diabetic ketoacidosis beta cell,209.61,6.21
destruction varies it is frequently more,213.27,4.58
rapid in children compared to adults,215.82,4.56
some patients with absolute incident,217.85,5.109
insulin deficiency have no evidence of,220.38,4.53
autoimmunity and have no other known,222.959,4.5
cause for beta cell destruction this is,224.91,5.13
quite rare and when this occurs these,227.459,4.561
patients are said to have idiopathic or,230.04,6.35
type 1 relieved diabetes mellitus,232.02,4.37
