so when a human ingest carbohydrate I,6.84,5.83
will show you that and in my view it's,10.12,5.31
not what we were designed to do but I'll,12.67,5.3
have to present that information and,15.43,5.28
because we cannot allow the glucose in,17.97,4.6
the bloodstream to rise excessively and,20.71,4.92
because we only have 5 grams of glucose,22.57,5.67
in the bloodstream and we eat a hundred,25.63,4.11
grams at a sitting,28.24,3.299
suddenly brothers hundred grams of,29.74,4.05
carbohydrates which got to be stored in,31.539,5.011
a blood system that can only take five,33.79,5.67
grams and you have to ask the question,36.55,5.91
if glucose is so essential to humans why,39.46,4.98
do we only have five grams in the,42.46,4.079
bloodstream so you've got this hundred,44.44,3.959
grams coming to trying to stuff itself,46.539,4.051
into a space that it only take five,48.399,4.89
grams and the response that the humans,50.59,4.649
have evolved is to secrete the hormone,53.289,5.131
insulin an instant drives the glucose as,55.239,4.291
I'll show you into the fat cells,58.42,3.54
particularly including the fed cells in,59.53,5.37
the liver and that then brings the,61.96,6.0
glucose down so hyperinsulinemia is a,64.9,5.28
state where the insulin is higher than,67.96,4.77
it should be in response to the glucose,70.18,5.55
challenge and one of the key differences,72.73,6.09
in in people today the way we eat then,75.73,6.57
we ate in the 1500s is in the 1500s we,78.82,6.6
ate once a day and that is documented,82.3,7.08
across Europe we ate once a day that,85.42,5.64
meant even if you had an insulin,89.38,5.37
response you had 23 hours for the system,91.06,6.42
to get back to normal what we do now as,94.75,4.47
we eat every three hours and we told to,97.48,2.49
eat every six,99.22,3.21
we're told that eat six meals a day that,99.97,4.38
means if it's carbohydrates we get this,102.43,4.47
insulin response so every time we eat,104.35,4.2
we've got this in Parkinson emic,106.9,3.54
response and if you have insulin,108.55,3.24
resistance like people with diabetes,110.44,4.08
like myself the response is exaggerated,111.79,5.31
so every time you eat you're damaging,114.52,3.96
your liver and you're damaging your,117.1,3.83
arteries,118.48,2.45
you,127.06,2.059
