hello everyone my name is dr. Myers I am,2.54,5.979
a practicing endocrinologist at Columbia,5.85,5.13
Hospital highball and I have my own,8.519,3.66
clinic in Vijay Nagar,10.98,4.02
which is known as health routes clinics,12.179,6.221
[Music],15.0,6.94
in any condition some normal or,18.4,6.73
pre-diabetes or having diabetes the,21.94,6.88
blood glucose level will increase after,25.13,7.65
eating food or taking any glucose or any,28.82,8.04
other eatables or liquid substance so it,32.78,7.17
the amount of glucose excursion depends,36.86,5.699
on two factors one is the body's ability,39.95,5.28
to metabolize so the form we take it in,42.559,4.891
whether it is a solid or a liquid form,45.23,4.59
second is whether it is containing,47.45,4.35
simple sugars or it contains complex,49.82,4.41
sugars with fat and protein if it,51.8,5.13
contains simple sugars the blood glucose,54.23,5.09
levels after 30 minutes can range from,56.93,5.879
anything between 100 to up to 200 or,59.32,7.18
sometimes even 250 if we take food that,62.809,6.631
is rich in complex carbohydrates with,66.5,5.37
fiber content and fat then the glucose,69.44,4.41
excursion is not very high it may just,71.87,5.4
reach around the 100 240 or hundred and,73.85,6.27
60 so if you take a fruit juice or,77.27,5.879
simple sugar drink or eat food like,80.12,6.209
white rice and potato rich food then the,83.149,5.671
sugar levels will really go high even,86.329,4.801
after 30 minutes it can reach up to 200,88.82,4.92
or even more than that sometimes but if,91.13,4.62
you take food that is rich in fiber and,93.74,4.68
low in carbohydrate then the glucose,95.75,5.789
levels will go from 100 to maximum 140,98.42,5.64
sometimes once it doesn't go so high,101.539,5.61
because it blows my body metabolizes eat,104.06,5.25
it when a slow thing and if you take,107.149,4.351
solid foods also the glucose excursion,109.31,4.739
will be a little late as compared to the,111.5,5.579
liquid freedom so glucose levels can,114.049,4.951
vary depending on the type of food and,117.079,5.43
the form in which we take that is the,119.0,5.429
liquid form and whether it is,122.509,4.881
carbohydrate rich,124.429,2.961
you,127.88,2.059
