hi everyone happy new year,7.639,5.531
I'm Cheryl Christian from low-gi meals,10.71,7.68
and I am a passionate fitness person but,13.17,7.26
I'm also very very passionate about,18.39,4.799
teaching nutrition I myself did not,20.43,4.679
understand the correlation of how,23.189,4.561
important it was to eat right to get the,25.109,4.801
best out of your workout and to live a,27.75,4.38
really healthy lifestyle so I want to,29.91,5.37
start off with just a very few simple,32.13,5.46
points there are six classes of,35.28,3.9
nutrients let's start with that so you,37.59,4.05
have your carbohydrates proteins and,39.18,4.92
fats and then there's vitamins minerals,41.64,4.649
and water I only want to talk right now,44.1,4.139
about the first three because those are,46.289,3.36
the ones that are going to provide an,48.239,4.021
energy source to you and fuel your,49.649,5.82
activities so what I want to also talk,52.26,4.77
about is the importance of the low,55.469,4.531
glycemic index now a lot of people are,57.03,4.829
just starting to hear about this so I'm,60.0,4.409
going to try and quickly explain what,61.859,4.651
it's all about to you so first of all,64.409,5.011
we're talking about carbohydrates so in,66.51,4.92
that food group you're going we're,69.42,6.269
talking about your breads rice pastas,71.43,6.299
your fruits and vegetables these are all,75.689,5.22
carbohydrates they give you energy,77.729,6.721
sometimes instant energy we don't want,80.909,5.221
you to focus on those foods that give,84.45,3.36
you instant energy and I'm going to tell,86.13,4.41
you why right now here's my chart and,87.81,4.26
let's just say in the morning you have,90.54,4.59
at breakfast and you have let's just say,92.07,6.119
whole-wheat toast and some juice those,95.13,5.76
foods break down very quickly to blood,98.189,4.621
glucose or blood sugar okay they're,100.89,3.6
gonna break down into a sugar in your,102.81,4.379
system they're going to raise your blood,104.49,5.37
Sugar's really quickly and what happens,107.189,5.101
at that peak point is the body's,109.86,5.31
pancreas is going to release insulin now,112.29,6.0
insulins job is to drive that energy,115.17,5.46
into the muscles so we can be active and,118.29,5.219
have lots of energy but what's happening,120.63,6.36
now is we are getting too much a surge,123.509,6.631
from a lot of our refined products that,126.99,5.34
we're eating when that happens,130.14,5.91
when the insulin drives the blood sugars,132.33,8.76
down you have this fast rise and a fast,136.05,7.68
drop when you bottomed out you become,141.09,4.95
hypoglycemic and you often become a,143.73,4.68
little bit shaky you don't feel so good,146.04,3.96
and what happens you start craving,148.41,3.9
carbohydrates again you want something,150.0,4.14
sweet a sticky bun you want something,152.31,4.53
some chocolate you want another cup of,154.14,5.1
coffee because you're feeling low your,156.84,4.89
Energy's down so what happens we eat,159.24,5.75
those carbohydrates back we go up and,161.73,6.84
again insulin is secreted from the,164.99,6.46
pancreas and if we have too much of this,168.57,5.7
insulin it is a fat storage hormone so,171.45,5.13
this overabundance of insulin,174.27,4.74
circulating in our system actually puts,176.58,5.82
us into a weight gain mode so that's not,179.01,5.79
what we want and we call this the roller,182.4,4.53
coaster effect we eat a high glycemic,184.8,4.56
food we crash we eat a high glycemic,186.93,4.86
food we crash what we want to do is,189.36,4.44
bring our blood Sugar's down so when we,191.79,3.96
eat a low glycemic breakfast choice so,193.8,4.05
let's just say we're having some yogurt,195.75,3.69
and fruit would be a great choice and,197.85,3.81
there's so many other wonderful choices,199.44,4.41
you could have your blood Sugar's just,201.66,6.36
rise slowly and they come down slowly we,203.85,6.03
are now in control of what we're eating,208.02,5.34
our energy supply is more constant we're,209.88,5.42
not getting that huge fluctuation so,213.36,5.04
we're now our body is able to start,215.3,6.61
releasing body fat plus we have,218.4,6.09
consistent energy so I'm quickly going,221.91,5.4
to show you a few food choices that you,224.49,5.7
might want to consider click cook,227.31,4.77
oatmeal is actually really high on the,230.19,5.73
glycemic index anything can over 65 to a,232.08,6.26
hundred is considered high glycemic,235.92,4.74
whereas a slow cook oatmeal is only,238.34,5.22
forty to sixty so much better choice,240.66,5.69
pasta you can have pasta but we,243.56,5.05
recommend you go al dente so it's,246.35,4.45
slightly undercooked rather than that,248.61,4.44
overcooked pasta which can send your,250.8,5.58
blood sugars rising so quickly there's,253.05,5.4
some good cereals on the market but not,256.38,4.289
too many people are surprised like bran,258.45,4.26
flakes cheerios etc can be very high,260.669,2.531
glassing,262.71,2.05
Micke they actually break down into,263.2,4.44
sugar really quickly in your system for,264.76,4.65
those who are vegetarian there's awesome,267.64,5.16
choices so the legumes quinoa if you,269.41,5.19
haven't tried it as a great source it's,272.8,4.74
a protein in a carbohydrate sweet,274.6,5.82
potatoes versus a whole white potato a,277.54,4.86
russet potato russet potatoes are really,280.42,5.16
high glycemic so simple choices dietary,282.4,5.4
changes in your diet can give you a,285.58,3.96
better workout they can help you manage,287.8,4.95
your weight feel better and but will,289.54,4.77
actually the list goes on and on so,292.75,3.63
anyways that's my little bit today I,294.31,4.32
just wanted to get you thinking about,296.38,5.04
your nutrition it's so important they're,298.63,4.89
