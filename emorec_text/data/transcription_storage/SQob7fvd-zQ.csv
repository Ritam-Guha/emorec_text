welcome to pregnancy and postpartum tv a,0.24,3.92
lot of my moms in my gestational,2.72,2.96
diabetes facebook group,4.16,2.8
have been complaining that they are,5.68,3.52
super sick of eggs and they were asking,6.96,2.559
for,9.2,2.559
breakfast recipes that can still get,9.519,3.761
good blood sugar so today i'm going to,11.759,1.92
share,13.28,2.88
a list of breakfast ideas that aren't,13.679,3.041
eggs,16.16,2.24
that will still get good blood sugar,16.72,3.36
this is one video in a series of videos,18.4,3.12
that i continuously add to for,20.08,2.8
gestational diabetes so if you like,21.52,2.32
videos like these,22.88,2.639
please subscribe hit the notification,23.84,3.12
bell and share this video with another,25.519,3.201
community of moms who has gestational,26.96,2.559
diabetes,28.72,3.839
the first one is porridge so you may not,29.519,4.961
be able to have the quick,32.559,4.0
porridge because of the higher glycemic,34.48,3.84
index but you might do better with,36.559,3.68
a little bit of steel cut oats or even,38.32,3.28
large flake oats,40.239,2.801
but if you're still struggling with your,41.6,3.119
blood sugar after that then,43.04,3.999
you may do better with note meal which,44.719,3.441
is made with,47.039,4.081
nuts and almond flour and coconut flour,48.16,4.32
and i'm going to link to that in the,51.12,3.439
description box below and you could add,52.48,3.44
low glycemic index,54.559,3.52
berries or you could add one of the,55.92,3.439
sweeteners that doesn't increase your,58.079,2.96
blood sugar so that would be equal,59.359,4.081
or splenda and those are artificial,61.039,4.321
sweeteners i actually prefer,63.44,4.32
something like stevia or monk fruit,65.36,5.04
which are made from plants so stevia is,67.76,4.399
a green leafy plant i used to grow it in,70.4,3.92
my garden dehydrate it and that sweetens,72.159,4.161
food but you can also buy,74.32,4.64
the drops from the store or monk fruit,76.32,4.56
is a berry that comes from china and it,78.96,3.839
also doesn't increase blood sugar,80.88,4.96
as well okay so the next one is waffles,82.799,3.281
or,85.84,2.08
pancakes so again you can kind of get,86.08,4.079
keto versions or make keto versions of,87.92,4.08
these so i know kodiak,90.159,3.6
has pancakes and waffles that a lot of,92.0,3.439
the moms in the gestational diabetes,93.759,2.641
group are enjoying,95.439,3.121
but you can also make them with almond,96.4,4.399
flour and cottage cheese,98.56,4.08
and again they're really delicious and,100.799,4.401
similar to the oatmeal you could add,102.64,5.839
fruit or berries you could add,105.2,7.04
for example unsweetened greek yogurt or,108.479,4.241
even an,112.24,2.159
unsweetened whipped cream to make it,112.72,3.359
really delicious or use any of the,114.399,3.04
sweeteners that don't increase your,116.079,2.241
blood sugar,117.439,2.96
okay so if you're craving something like,118.32,3.28
hash brands you can make,120.399,3.04
cauliflower hash brands and i'm also,121.6,3.839
going to share a recipe to a vegan,123.439,2.96
homemade,125.439,3.201
mayo which is delicious with those as,126.399,4.161
well but doesn't contain raw egg,128.64,4.88
which makes it safe during pregnancy the,130.56,4.319
next one i'm going to talk about is if,133.52,2.96
you're looking for something super easy,134.879,3.681
so just a bowl of cottage cheese and,136.48,4.72
then adding berries and nuts,138.56,4.64
this recipe that i'm going to share has,141.2,3.92
pomegranate seeds chia seeds and,143.2,4.64
hazelnuts and it's really delicious,145.12,5.36
i'm also going to share a recipe for,147.84,3.28
chia,150.48,2.8
raspberry pudding which is delicious you,151.12,3.6
can make it the day before and it can be,153.28,2.48
ready to go,154.72,3.92
the next day i did another video also on,155.76,4.479
a gestational diabetes,158.64,3.2
breakfast smoothie so i'm going to link,160.239,3.761
to that and i'll also link to it in the,161.84,4.96
cards above if you're on your phone you,164.0,4.48
could do something like keto chocolate,166.8,3.04
chip cookies or i'm going to share,168.48,4.399
another sunflower cookie recipe,169.84,5.119
leftovers is also a great breakfast so,172.879,3.921
if you have something like chicken or,174.959,4.881
meat and even a little bit of sweet,176.8,4.719
potato from the night before you could,179.84,2.8
make that into,181.519,2.881
a breakfast pretty easily by just,182.64,3.44
warming it up again i hope that gave you,184.4,2.88
some breakfast ideas,186.08,3.439
we do tend to struggle with blood sugars,187.28,4.08
earlier in the morning as we sleep we,189.519,2.961
produce hormones,191.36,3.04
and these hormones cause insulin,192.48,4.399
resistance so our insulin isn't able to,194.4,3.6
move our sugar from,196.879,3.841
our blood stream into our cells as,198.0,4.159
easily in the morning hours,200.72,4.48
so some women do find it more helpful to,202.159,4.321
help control their sugars,205.2,3.119
by having a lower carb amount at,206.48,3.44
breakfast so if you're looking for more,208.319,3.041
ideas you can always,209.92,4.399
search search up keto breakfast ideas,211.36,3.439
and then,214.319,2.321
add in the amount of carb that you,214.799,3.841
decided with your dietitian or your,216.64,3.04
doctor with,218.64,3.44
some women can handle up to 45 grams of,219.68,4.479
carbohydrate at breakfast but this isn't,222.08,2.879
necessary,224.159,2.72
and i find a lot of women do better if,224.959,3.761
they're having around 20 grams of,226.879,3.761
carbohydrate for their breakfast,228.72,3.36
