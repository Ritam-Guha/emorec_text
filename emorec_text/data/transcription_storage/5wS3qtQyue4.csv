hey everyone so today's talking Tuesday,0.03,3.48
was a request and I got a comment from a,1.74,3.36
user who was asking about this condition,3.51,3.3
that she has I'm gonna try to pronounce,5.1,3.69
it and if I butcher it I'm sorry it is,6.81,5.52
called a cam ptosis nigricans and I'm,8.79,5.28
not sure I pronounced that right but,12.33,3.24
what it is it's kind of like this,14.07,3.78
pigmentation this darkening of the skin,15.57,4.2
and it kind of appears on the body it,17.85,4.259
can't happen elbows knees usually it's,19.77,4.339
in the armpits or in the folds of skin,22.109,3.901
some people who have a little bit more,24.109,3.851
stomach flaps or things that really hang,26.01,2.4
over,27.96,2.489
they might get this discoloration there,28.41,3.809
and it's not something that you can get,30.449,3.54
off it's actually change in the skin,32.219,3.84
also be found here and folds in the neck,33.989,4.381
a lot of us have these natural folds and,36.059,3.961
some of those and some people have,38.37,3.029
larger folds than that this are here on,40.02,3.18
the chin and a lot of times this,41.399,4.051
condition will show up the groin and the,43.2,4.17
forehead and really any of these areas,45.45,3.69
that you will find some of these folds,47.37,3.24
happen which is the intent of the elbow,49.14,4.2
or the exterior dent of the knee now as,50.61,4.379
far as treatment goes there really is,53.34,3.239
nothing topical that you guys can apply,54.989,3.601
to get rid of this but the main thing is,56.579,4.261
to kind of treat the underlying cause,58.59,4.199
what is causing it in the first place,60.84,3.87
and I totally believe that for instance,62.789,4.44
acne just don't just zap does it treat,64.71,4.56
what's causing visit in the first place,67.229,4.171
you know what I mean so that's exactly,69.27,4.83
the way medical professionals treat this,71.4,4.23
condition there are a couple of things,74.1,3.54
that kind of onset it it can be highly,75.63,4.02
genetic and in that case you just want,77.64,3.99
to do some lifestyle changes just to,79.65,3.84
kind of help circulate blood and really,81.63,3.3
just kind of try to remove that and,83.49,2.94
prevent it from getting worse there are,84.93,2.939
some medications out there but you,86.43,2.43
really should talk to your doctor,87.869,2.671
something over-the-counter that may help,88.86,3.6
is fish oil or foods they're really,90.54,3.78
really high in that omega-3 there are,92.46,3.63
some topical medications that have been,94.32,3.99
effective but again this isn't foolproof,96.09,5.04
so I'm Tetra niacin some lactaid creams,98.31,4.349
have been shown to help sometimes,101.13,3.36
hydroquinone which is a skin lightening,102.659,3.451
agent of course with all of these do you,104.49,2.909
want to make sure that you avoid sun,106.11,3.0
exposure and apply sunscreen whenever,107.399,2.4
you're out and about,109.11,2.64
sometimes even accutane is shown and,109.799,4.11
taken orally to kind of help that but,111.75,4.35
again don't do this unless your doctor,113.909,3.57
kind of tells you to and unless you have,116.1,2.339
medical supervision,117.479,2.881
sometimes contraceptives such as birth,118.439,3.151
control or even things like,120.36,3.359
microdermabrasion um some of these skin,121.59,4.529
treatments can help but those are really,123.719,5.07
for extreme cases a lot of times these,126.119,5.37
kind of flare-ups can be precursors of,128.789,4.051
tumors so if,131.489,3.661
guys have a ton of these and they're not,132.84,3.75
genetic you may want to get checked for,135.15,3.69
cancer or diabetes because diabetes can,136.59,4.2
also onset this people who are,138.84,3.42
overweight or even if you're not,140.79,3.12
overweight and have this condition you,142.26,3.18
should get a cancer screen to see if,143.91,2.969
there's any tumors that are altering,145.44,3.689
hormone levels and things like that also,146.879,4.291
increase your exercise and clean up your,149.129,4.411
diet diet exercise have everything to do,151.17,3.929
your body is kind of like a machine,153.54,2.91
everything goes together and if one,155.099,2.581
thing goes wrong everything else is,156.45,3.78
gonna go wrong so if you guys exercise,157.68,4.71
you can lower those insulin levels if,160.23,3.78
you eat right you lower those insulin,162.39,3.42
levels the lower those insulin levels,164.01,3.69
are the less likely you're going to be,165.81,3.39
to have these kind of outbreaks and,167.7,3.78
create this pigmentation and kind of,169.2,4.17
increased melanin patches in these areas,171.48,3.93
of skin also the less of these folds you,173.37,3.929
have you know do some exercise get rid,175.41,3.57
of these folds it's not going to be as,177.299,3.541
noticeable there are surgical procedures,178.98,3.33
where you can take out the folds and,180.84,3.239
take out the color but again that's in,182.31,3.63
very extreme cases and I really,184.079,3.571
recommend diet and exercise just to kind,185.94,3.21
of help clean that up a lot of people,187.65,3.419
who are insulin resistant or who have,189.15,4.08
diabetes will have this condition so if,191.069,3.81
that's you keep on taking your,193.23,4.319
medication and then really really really,194.879,4.471
try to just lower those insulin levels,197.549,3.541
naturally do that by eating small meals,199.35,3.66
throughout the day snacks all day long,201.09,4.2
don't eat meals eat things that are low,203.01,4.17
on the glycemic index scale and really,205.29,3.69
really really get your exercise up now,207.18,3.51
also increased blood flow which will,208.98,3.119
increase blood flow to the top of the,210.69,3.449
skin and really help break down all that,212.099,4.441
stuff I personally think that with diet,214.139,4.801
exercise maybe a little bit of,216.54,4.08
hydroquinone to lighten that up or even,218.94,3.54
lemon juice and then lots of sunscreen,220.62,4.38
that mild cases of this can be treatable,222.48,4.349
but of course please talk to your doctor,225.0,3.239
first and really see what options are,226.829,3.27
best for you so I hope this kind of,228.239,3.391
helps you guys I don't currently have,230.099,3.841
this condition I hope I never get it but,231.63,3.84
it can be genetic or people can develop,233.94,3.51
it over time so if you guys have it if,235.47,3.419
you know someone that has it or if,237.45,2.7

wondering about it but if you've never,242.4,2.97
