hey it's jen eden here founder of the,6.64,3.44
sugar freedom method,8.559,3.841
and i get asked all the time about hey,10.08,5.28
jen so i eat sugar i drink wine,12.4,5.52
i live my life how do i flush this stuff,15.36,4.4
out of my system fairly quickly,17.92,3.439
so i am going to talk to you about that,19.76,4.16
today um but before i do that i always,21.359,4.24
ask if you could please,23.92,4.88
hit subscribe join my community and i'd,25.599,4.481
be eternally grateful,28.8,4.96
okay so get this there are ways to get,30.08,6.08
sugar out of the body fairly quickly it,33.76,4.24
does take many days you have to know,36.16,3.36
once you eat it i call it,38.0,3.84
taking a hit it's not just like tomorrow,39.52,4.16
you're going to be fine,41.84,5.36
could take 72 hours plus at 72 hours,43.68,4.32
plus,47.2,2.96
but i've talked about this before in,48.0,4.0
other educational videos,50.16,4.44
that our skin is our largest,52.0,4.64
detoxification organ,54.6,5.24
so the more you can sweat and get in,56.64,4.399
movement,59.84,4.24
okay the quicker you can get sugar,61.039,6.001
out of your bloodstream out of your body,64.08,4.64
and you feeling better so that's number,67.04,3.36
one,68.72,4.719
number two you might giggle at this one,70.4,5.759
but i need you to stop eating it,73.439,5.36
your body will naturally work chemicals,76.159,3.681
like sugar,78.799,3.921
and wine out of your body but it can't,79.84,4.88
do that if you keep adding it,82.72,5.039
in so number two is i need you to stop,84.72,5.439
consuming that which is inflaming your,87.759,3.441
body,90.159,3.92
and give your body time to get it out of,91.2,4.72
your system okay it might sound simple,94.079,3.601
but we don't always think about it,95.92,3.519
and then we just keep compounding the,97.68,3.759
issue and we wonder why we don't feel,99.439,2.64
well,101.439,2.401
and we're on these sugar highs and lows,102.079,4.32
it's because we keep consuming it,103.84,4.239
okay and then number three this one,106.399,3.841
might seem obvious but i have to say it,108.079,4.241
because it's not to everyone,110.24,5.04
when we drink water yes and i know,112.32,4.64
nutritionists say half your body weight,115.28,2.799
in ounces,116.96,4.32
i'm not a fan of that um i believe,118.079,5.04
you should drink more than that,121.28,4.24
especially if you're feeling dehydrated,123.119,4.32
and you're thirsty all the time you are,125.52,4.32
so dehydrated so drink more than that,127.439,6.401
um please consider that and on days when,129.84,5.28
we're eating sugar,133.84,3.92
we're having tons of processed foods um,135.12,3.52
alcohol,137.76,2.559
one of the quickest ways to get it out,138.64,3.52
of our system other than sweating,140.319,4.321
and not having more of it is to number,142.16,3.12
three,144.64,3.36
drink water okay we are 80 plus percent,145.28,3.679
water,148.0,2.959
our bodies and so i need you to drink,148.959,3.92
water to flush,150.959,5.201
out the toxins and the sugar so take,152.879,4.961
that in a second i need you to drink,156.16,2.159
water,157.84,2.88
wake up and drink it drink it before,158.319,4.321
lunch drink it after lunch,160.72,3.44
but definitely don't drink it right,162.64,4.56
before bed because i need you to sleep,164.16,5.76
okay but that is um three really fast,167.2,4.96
ways to get sugar out of your body so,169.92,3.52
if you tend to eat sugar and you're,172.16,2.96
drinking wine which turns to sugar,173.44,3.439
