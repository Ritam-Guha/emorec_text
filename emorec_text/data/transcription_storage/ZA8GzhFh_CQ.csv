"Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM.",8.44,1.0
"We're going to continue our series today of
our 8 Best Exercises.",9.44,3.53
"This time covering the 8 Best Bodyweight Exercises
you can do.",12.97,2.88
"And we're going to mix it up guys, it's not
just strength training exercises but conditioning",15.85,3.67
as well.,19.52,1.0
"If you want to be an Athlete, you've got to
train like an Athlete.",20.52,2.03
"We're going to combine both strength and conditioning
to cover each of these 8 exercises.",22.55,3.58
And guess what?,26.13,1.0
"We're going to cover your whole body too and
the only piece of equipment that you'll need",27.13,3.57
"to manipulate your own bodyweight for a few
of the exercises is a single Pullup Bar.",30.7,3.86
"Guys if you don't have one already, invest
in one.",34.56,2.08
"10 to 15 bucks is well worth your development
here.",36.64,3.419
So let's get it started.,40.059,1.801
The 8 Best Bodyweight Exercises you can do.,41.86,1.8
"Alright let's kick this list off the right
way, with the old classic Pull Up.",43.66,4.21
"There's no way that we can get through an
8 Best Exercises list without including this",47.87,3.449
one,51.319,1.0
"because it simply is one of the best things
you can do for your upper body and it is a",52.319,2.791
great Bodyweight option.,55.11,1.71
"Now let's say you are not getting enough out
of a Pull Up.",56.82,3.039
"Or you're looking for something more advanced
or more difficult,",59.859,2.781
"we can involve more muscles in the exercise
by simply switching our grip.",62.64,4.0
"And the thing here guys you will see, the
common theme with all these exercises is there",66.64,3.62
are certainly ways to modify,70.26,2.01
"to make these exercises more of a regression
to make them easier or make them a progression",72.27,4.0
to make them harder.,76.27,1.0
And being able to master that is the key.,77.27,1.952
"Because you never want to get stagnant with
any of your upper body exercises or any of",79.222,2.858
your Bodyweight exercises period.,82.08,1.95
"So here if I switch my grip up to what we
call the Commando Pull Up.",84.03,3.43
"Now I've got a Core involvement because my
body wants to twist in one side as soon as",87.46,3.68
you take this over under grip.,91.14,1.48
You can't let that happen.,92.62,1.15
"We're going to let our Core kick in and actually
help us to stay stable while we Pull Up to",93.77,4.6
each side of the bar.,98.37,1.0
"Of course a little bit extra Forearm involvement
here, a little bit of Biceps, never a bad",99.37,3.57
"thing here when we're trying to Amp Up the
intensity of the exercise.",102.94,3.68
"Let's stick with that theme though, as we
move to number 2.",106.62,2.68
Let's get those Biceps a little bit more involved.,109.3,2.08
"And of course let's get that Core a little
bit more involved too just by flipping the",111.38,3.23
"grip all the way over to what we call a Chin
Up Knee Up.",114.61,3.1
"And you can see as I do this exercise, it's
two parts.",117.71,3.04
"The first part is getting my head up over
that bar through a natural Chin Up.",120.75,3.26
"Which we know that positioning will work our
Biceps a lot more than it would in a normal",124.01,3.81
Pull Up positioning.,127.82,1.0
"And of course, let's involve those Abs as
well by finishing with the Knee Up.",128.82,4.42
"Guys a great way to get more out of your Bodyweight
Exercises and Training is to put more in them.",133.24,3.932
"And you can see this exercise gives us that
opportunity.",137.172,2.808
"Add a few more muscle groups, make the movement
a little bit more complex but you're going",139.98,4.16
"to get the rewards that you're looking for,
much quicker.",144.14,2.43
"Ok, let's throw the equipment away altogether
and shift to the other half of our body, our",146.57,4.85
Legs.,151.42,1.0
"And by far one of the most difficult lower
body exercises you can do is a Bodyweight",152.42,4.72
"exercise and it's a the Slick Floor Bridge
Curl.",157.14,1.84
"And you can see, all you need to do is put
on a pair of socks, find some kind of a slick",158.98,4.37
floor.,163.35,1.0
"Which here I'm using tile, you can use a wood
floor.",164.35,2.23
"Anything that you can actually just slide
your socks on and you've got one of the best",166.58,3.91
Glute Hamstring developers in your arsenal.,170.49,2.66
"The great thing about the Slick Floor Bridge
Curl is you're actually training your muscles",173.15,3.43
to work the way they're supposed to work.,176.58,2.18
"You don't ever want to have your Hamstrings
trying to work without the help of the Glutes.",178.76,4.44
"You see far too often, when the Hamstrings
have to do all the work, that's when you get",183.2,3.98
a Hamstring injury.,187.18,1.0
"Let the bigger stronger Glutes kick in and
this exercise forces you to do that by holding",188.18,4.22
"your Bridge up high and then initiating the
Hamstring Curl.",192.4,3.94
"Of course we can't neglect the front side
of our legs and this exercise gives us an",196.34,3.74
opportunity to make sure we don't.,200.08,2.45
This is our Levitation Squat.,202.53,1.94
"The Levitation Squat is actually a really
good exercise for those particularly those",204.47,4.31
"that have a hard time maybe even attempting
a Pistol Squat.",208.78,4.12
"The Pistol Squat puts our leg out in front
of us which makes it a lot harder for us to",212.9,4.14
even balance.,217.04,1.0
"It's not necessarily that you don't have the
single leg strength to execute it, but you",218.04,3.701
"might not have the single leg strength combined
with the balance to execute it.",221.741,4.379
"Now, can you progress yourself to a Pistol
Squat?",226.12,2.369
"By all means, Yes.",228.489,1.021
"And you can actually self spot yourself by
hanging on to a bar when you perform it, until",229.51,4.559
"you build the adequate strength and balance
to do it.",234.069,2.731
"But I'm going to tell you, I still love the
Levitation Squat.",236.8,2.0
It makes my knees feel a little bit better,238.8,1.85
"and I'm able to actually push and get a little
bit more out of every single rep and therefore",240.65,4.26
"for me, I put it right at the top of my list.",244.91,3.18
"Ok, you knew that no Bodyweight list would
ever be complete without some variation of",248.09,3.41
a Pushup.,251.5,1.0
"Right, we know that we're going to have to
target our Chest with some type of Pushup",252.5,3.03
"because that really is the best option outside
of Dips.",255.53,3.5
"But we're trying to limit the equipment here,
right, I always said only a Pull Up Bar.",259.03,3.93
"The bodyweight Pushup that I like here is
the Divebomber Pushup because if you perform",262.96,4.429
"this exercise correctly you're not just targeting
your Chest,",267.389,3.051
"but you're actually heavily targeting your
Shoulders, your Chest and your Triceps at",270.44,4.37
different ranges in the motion.,274.81,2.27
"See when you first start your descent, you're
actually working a lot on your Shoulders and",277.08,3.96
when you get down to the bottom of the rep,281.04,1.45
"you're really maximizing your Chest and as
you come back up and out, you're really contracting",282.49,4.84
"the Triceps as you get a little bit of extension
back behind your body.",287.33,3.41
"You can make this even more difficult and
more rewarding and even target, either the",290.74,4.49
"Triceps or the Shoulders a little bit more,",295.23,2.08
"by simply performing as I'm showing you here,
a one and a half rep style of the exercise.",297.31,4.2
"So come down into the front, if you want to
work your Triceps and instead of coming all",301.51,3.45
"the way back up, head back up for one more
half a rep and then come back up.",304.96,4.27
"Or if you want to work your Shoulders a little
bit more, just simply stay at the top range",309.23,3.7
of the motion for just that extra half rep,312.93,1.73
"and you'll be able to give your Shoulders
just that little extra that they might need",314.66,3.27
to start making them pop even more.,317.93,1.44
"Speaking of Shoulders, there's actually a
way that we can work them and still get in",319.37,4.16
"those conditioning benefits that I talked
about earlier in the video.",323.53,3.16
And the perfect example here is a Mule Kick.,326.69,2.42
"This exercise is incredibly demanding, trust
me, if you haven't tried one, try it.",329.11,4.63
"What happens is you've got to support your
entire body weight, whatever that might be",333.74,4.1
and push your legs up towards the ceiling.,337.84,2.4
"Every rep is basically a version of a dynamic
or explosive Shoulder Press with your Shoulders",340.24,5.37
still in contact with the ground.,345.61,1.55
"So instead of trying to push the Dumbbells
up and away from you, you're trying to push",347.16,3.16
your body up and away from the ground.,350.32,2.12
"And definitely a challenging exercise and
one you should try and talk about the conditioning",352.44,4.6
benefits?,357.04,1.0
"Do this for a minute straight and I'll tell
you, your Heart will be pumping and you'll",358.04,3.56
likely be breaking a serious sweat.,361.6,2.1
"Of course one of the most classic conditioning
exercises you can do when you're talking Bodyweight,",363.7,4.719
is a Burpee.,368.419,1.151
But a Burpee alone is boring.,369.57,1.93
"We can do a lot more guys, if you want to
train Athletic, again challenge yourself to",371.5,3.68
do more things.,375.18,1.049
"Challenge yourself to do things in not just
the sagittal plane, up and down but make yourself",376.229,4.351
more athletic by involving some rotation.,380.58,2.75
"And the version I'm showing you here of the
Burpee is certainly a way we can do that.",383.33,3.251
"This is the Side Kickthrough Burpee or just
a plain old Kickthrough Burpee.",386.581,3.618
"This is a bitch but I love it, because it
will get those lungs burning in no time, I",390.199,4.321
promise you.,394.52,1.0
"And again, it's combining a great amount of
athleticism to do it.",395.52,3.85
"Yeah, there's some coordination involved here
too but I promise if you just practice it",399.37,3.63
"a couple times,",403.0,1.15
"you're going to master this exercise and in
doing so, get control of one of the best conditioning",404.15,4.68
bodyweight exercises that you can ever do.,408.83,2.13
"Ok, last but certainly not least, let's break
out the Pull Up Bar one last time and ratchet",410.96,4.36
"up the difficulty level just a little bit
more",415.32,2.28
"for one of the most rewarding upper body Bodyweight
exercises that you can do and that is the",417.6,3.83
Front Lever.,421.43,1.1
"The Front Lever is going to demand two muscle
groups work together that don't normally prefer",422.53,4.35
"to work together and that is the upper back
and the Core.",426.88,2.74
"See you can do this because we know that the
Core is going to have to provide the stability",429.62,3.44
"to fight that force of gravity that's trying
to bend you in half every single time you",433.06,4.06
lift yourself up.,437.12,1.0
"And oh by the way, the only way you're going
to be able to lift yourself up is by having",438.12,3.1
"the adequate strength in your upper back to
perform what is essentially",441.22,3.38
"a Straight Arm Pushdown without weights to
get your body up and against that force of",444.6,4.2
gravity.,448.8,1.0
"This is absolutely one of the best exercises
that you can do and it's one that commands",449.8,2.92
"respect because everybody knows, it's pretty
damn hard to do.",452.72,2.93
Don't be discouraged if you can't do it.,455.65,1.76
"You can always break out an assisted band
to try to anchor your feet in until you've",457.41,4.41
"built up the strength to be able to do the
exercise fully.",461.82,2.77
"But still, whatever way you wind up doing
it, it's still a great exercise and one of",464.59,3.88
"the best to add to your bodyweight exercise
routines.",468.47,2.43
"Alright guys, so there you have it, 8 exercises
to prove once again, that Bodyweight training",470.9,4.37
does not have to be inferior training.,475.27,2.01
"As a matter of fact, our ATHLEAN XERO Program,
we're going to throw away the Pull Up Bar,",477.28,4.09
"give you all new ways to work your back and
your Biceps without it",481.37,2.76
"and not to mention, combine strength and conditioning
always and give you progressive ways to help",484.13,4.78
you to build muscle.,488.91,1.12
"That is available guys, at ATHLEAN XERO @ ATHLEANX.COM.",490.03,3.18
"In the meantime, if you found this video helpful,
make sure you leave your comments and thumbs",493.21,3.07
up below.,496.28,1.0
"And remember, Bodyweight training, you can
change the way you do exercises just like",497.28,2.95
"we did with the Divebomber Pushup to elicit
all new responses from those movements.",500.23,3.839
"You can change the way you group exercises
together.",504.069,2.401
"You can change the progresses and you can
regress if you have to.",506.47,2.52
"It's all about how you put the exercise together
that determines what you get out of them.",508.99,3.929
"Alright guys, I'll see you back here again
soon.",512.919,2.15
"Let me know whatever else it is that you want
to see and I'll do my best to bring it to",515.069,2.52
you here three times a week.,517.589,0.07
