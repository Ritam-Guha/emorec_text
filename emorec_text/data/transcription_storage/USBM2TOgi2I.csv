My name is Matthew Deluhery.,7.504,1.166
"I'm an emergency
medicine physician",8.67,2.15
"with Wheaten Franciscan
Healthcare, an emergency",10.82,2.6
"medicine specialist, working in
Milwaukee and Waukesha County.",13.42,3.92
"Today's lecture is going
to be about the GI tract,",17.34,2.84
"as well as the GU and
reproductive tract.",20.18,2.674
"We're going to spend
quite a bit of time",22.854,1.666
"on the pathology of those
particular tracts, that's",24.52,6.81
going to be towards the end.,31.33,1.37
"The first part of this is going
to be a review of the anatomy",32.7,2.8
"and physiology of both the macro
and micro parts of the anatomy.",35.5,6.54
We'll get right into it.,42.04,1.06
"The GI system, I think we're
all very familiar with.",43.1,3.17
"It's for the digestion
of food and then",46.27,2.59
"you absorb your water
and your nutrients.",48.86,3.29
"It's also part of the
detoxifying system,",52.15,2.1
"we'll talk quite about that when
we talk about the liver as well",54.25,4.19
as the GI role with it.,58.44,4.04
"Any disturbance, certainly
in the GI system,",62.48,2.18
"not only affects that
particular system",64.66,2.24
"but can affect the body's
homeostasis in its entirety",66.9,4.95
with it.,71.85,2.9
"Grossly, I think we're quite
familiar with the GI system.",74.75,3.25
"It makes a lot of intuitive
sense to paramedics.",78.0,3.09
"They've dealt with
it quite a bit.",81.09,2.18
"All we have to envision is
what happens when you eat",83.27,2.3
"and when you swallow, starting
with the oral cavity going down",85.57,3.9
"into the pharynx, the
esophagus, into the stomach,",89.47,2.91
"small intestine, large
intestine, and the rectum.",92.38,2.844
"The important take
home point, and it'll",95.224,1.666
"be emphasized several times,
is that the GI system is not",96.89,3.36
"only the physical areas that
the food touches, but also all",100.25,3.57
"the different organs that
contribute to this homeostasis,",103.82,4.01
"like the liver, the gallbladder,
the saliva producing glands",107.83,5.05
with it.,112.88,0.5
"And that's very
important to remember",113.38,1.61
"when you consider the GI system
as a whole and different areas",114.99,4.28
"that can go wrong with it
that critical care paramedics",119.27,2.66
need to be familiar with.,121.93,2.67
"In particular, some of
these accessory organs,",124.6,2.23
"like the salivary glands,
we don't necessarily",126.83,2.77
"think of when we think
of the GI system,",129.6,2.31
"but certainly
they're immediately",131.91,2.5
"needed to produce different
sorts of enzymes and buffers",134.41,3.39
"in order to aid in the initial
secretion from your mouth",137.8,4.62
on down.,142.42,2.35
"Moving now to more of the micro
components of the GI system.",144.77,4.36
"When we look at the
walls of these tracts,",149.13,1.81
"they're actually divided
into four different layers,",150.94,2.84
"the mucosa, submucosa,
the muscularis externa,",153.78,3.01
and the serosa.,156.79,1.76
"Those four layers
are moving from what",158.55,2.13
"the food touches all
the way to the outside.",160.68,2.88
"The books tend to
emphasize these four layers",163.56,2.35
"and find them to be very
important that the paramedics",165.91,3.15
"are familiar with these
four different layers.",169.06,3.74
"As we start on the inside
with the mucosa layer,",172.8,3.27
"we have a lot of
the plicae in here,",176.07,2.46
the lamina propecia in there.,178.53,2.57
"This is where a lot
of the smooth muscle",181.1,2.11
lives within the GI tract.,183.21,4.39
"As we move out to the submucosa
and the muscularis areas",187.6,4.56
"we see a little bit more of
the glands being produced.",192.16,3.33
The blood vessels are in there.,195.49,2.48
"And this is where we get a lot
of the parasympathetic nervous",197.97,2.81
system in these outer layers.,200.78,2.2
"And so, as you can see, as
you move into these deeper",202.98,3.63
"layers of it, we start to
see more of the neuromuscular",206.61,4.44
areas.,211.05,1.09
"Then in the very
end, the part that's",212.14,2.58
"furthest away from the
food, or the first part",214.72,2.45
"that a surgeon would touch
is this the serosa layer.",217.17,3.41
"And this is the covering
of the GI tract.",220.58,5.47
"Moving back out, as we kind
of work our way down the GI",226.05,2.58
"system, we'll kind of touch each
of these particular areas one",228.63,4.87
at a time.,233.5,0.5
"We start with the oral
cavity, the pharynx.",234.0,2.74
It's in the mouth.,236.74,1.48
"And I think that
this particular part",238.22,1.64
is very intuitive for people.,239.86,2.4
It's the mechanical digestion.,242.26,1.58
"The actual chewing,
using your teeth,",243.84,1.92
"the breaking down of the
carbohydrates, in particular,",245.76,4.83
with your teeth and your tongue.,250.59,2.68
"Saliva is produced from a
lot of these salivary glands",253.27,4.28
in the mouth.,257.55,2.039
"And then, as you swallow, the
pharyngeal muscles contract",259.589,4.456
"and you push down
into the esophagus.",264.045,3.982
"And as you move down
in the esophagus,",268.027,1.583
"you get this idea
of peristalsis.",269.61,2.4
"That's a word that's
very commonly used,",272.01,2.6
"it's a very complex
neuromuscular pattern.",274.61,3.18
"Your book doesn't
emphasize all that,",277.79,1.64
"so I'm not going
to get into that.",279.43,1.82
"It's essentially the
way your body moves",281.25,1.75
"the food from the mouth all
the way down into the stomach.",283.0,4.56
"It has a very rich
vascular supply to it",287.56,3.26
"from carotid, the
different arteries.",290.82,2.915
"We often divide the esophagus
into three different parts,",297.11,2.96
"the superior, the mediastinal,
and the inferior part.",300.07,4.88
"The esophagus doesn't do much
for breaking down the food.",304.95,3.11
"It is purely a pipe that moves
material down into the stomach.",308.06,6.6
"As the food gets
into the stomach,",314.66,1.65
"the stomach is divided
into four different areas,",316.31,3.54
"the cardiac sphincter,
the fundus, the cardia,",319.85,2.68
"there's the body,
and then the pylorus",322.53,1.85
is at the very end of it there.,324.38,2.89
"These are not areas
that are grossly seen.",327.27,2.42
"You can't look at a
stomach and say, ah yes,",329.69,1.96
there's clearly the fundus area.,331.65,2.18
"These are areas that are
seen both histologically",333.83,5.9
"and are just vaguely
drawn anatomically.",339.73,4.18
"The stomach is more on the
left side of the abdomen.",343.91,2.79
It's in the left upper quadrant.,346.7,2.21
"It is immediately
under the diaphragm.",348.91,3.53
"The exact size can vary
quite a bit on individuals.",352.44,3.23
"It can vary depending
on your food intake",355.67,2.81
"and how you have been digesting
over the last couple of days.",358.48,5.11
"And then, obviously, the stomach
ends with the pyloric sphincter",363.59,4.15
"that empties into
the small intestine.",367.74,2.46
"The four areas do have slightly
different anatomical parts",373.55,5.75
to it.,379.3,0.5
The body being the largest part.,379.8,2.22
"The pylorus being
the part that's",382.02,2.23
"richest in the blood supply,
needed mostly to help",384.25,5.79
"get the food into
the small intestine.",390.04,2.64
"There are three main
arteries or the blood supply",392.68,2.53
"that helps keep the stomach
rich and full of nutrients.",395.21,2.98
"There is the left gastric
artery, the splenic arteries,",398.19,3.04
"and then one called the
common hepatic artery.",401.23,4.627
"And that is something that
the book emphasizes and could",405.857,2.333
"be used for testing, which is,
what are the different blood",408.19,2.8
supplies to the stomach?,410.99,3.7
"The stomach clearly is
a digestive process.",414.69,2.49
It is very active.,417.18,1.4
"The food moves around
in the stomach.",418.58,3.36
It is very active.,421.94,0.97
"People can hear their
stomach growling.",422.91,1.73
"They can hear the food
being broken down.",424.64,3.424
"And as a food breaks down it
breaks into something that we",428.064,2.416
"call, chime, C-H-I-M-E,
some people do pronounce it,",430.48,3.87
"C-H-Y-M-E, it can be
spelled either which way.",434.35,4.29
"And that is just the
breakdown product of the food",438.64,2.71
as it digests.,441.35,2.43
"And then this chime
actually exists the stomach,",443.78,2.51
"through the pyloric sphincter,
and into the small intestine.",446.29,3.815
"The small intestine is somewhere
between 15 and 25 feet,",450.105,3.485
"if you were to take it and
stretch it all the way out.",453.59,2.45
"However, in your body,
it's somewhat balled up.",456.04,2.01
"It takes a very
loop-de-loop type of track.",458.05,5.25
"And so it is not
clearly 25 feet long.",463.3,3.9
"It touches every
quadrant of your abdomen.",467.2,2.53
"Is a very frequent insult and
a stabbing, or a shooting,",469.73,3.53
"or any kind of penetrating
injury, only because it's",473.26,3.94
"this kind of a twisting
and turning type of path.",477.2,6.06
"It is divided into
three different parts,",483.26,2.14
just to exhaust us more.,485.4,1.34
"You can't just call it
the small intestine.",486.74,2.1
"The first part is the
duodenum, the do-a-di-num,",488.84,2.63
some people call it.,491.47,0.97
"Then comes the jejunum,
and then the ileum.",492.44,2.76
"All three of these
parts do different types",495.2,2.25
of digestion for the nutrients.,497.45,2.29
"And so we will talk about all
three of these separately.",499.74,4.15
The duodenum is the shortest.,503.89,2.17
It is very C-shaped.,506.06,1.55
"One part of it is
hooked up to the stomach",507.61,2.27
through the pyloric sphincter.,509.88,1.27
"And the other part is
hooked up to the jejunum.",511.15,3.8
"It is predominantly in the
retroperitoneal cavity.",514.95,2.295
"We're going to talk a
little a bit about what",517.245,1.875
that means in a little bit.,519.12,2.37
"And it certainly
aids quite a bit",521.49,2.049
in the digestion of nutrients.,523.539,4.671
"The jejunum is where the bulk
of the digestion and absorption",528.21,3.95
of all your nutrients is.,532.16,2.62
"People find this
quite interesting.",534.78,1.69
"It takes nearly halfway
through the GI tract",536.47,2.996
"until you're seeing the
bulk of the digestion",539.466,1.874
"and absorption in
the jejunum part.",541.34,3.4
"You're not seeing the majority
of it in the large intestine,",544.74,3.37
"or the stomach, which is a
common mistake that people",548.11,2.9
think.,551.01,0.5
"But it's predominantly
the small intestine,",551.51,2.37
"in the middle of the
small intestine, where",553.88,1.98
"a lot of your absorption
actually takes place.",555.86,3.39
"The ileum is the
terminal, or the end part,",559.25,3.11
of the small intestine.,562.36,1.78
It is about eight feet long.,564.14,1.54
"It actually has a
valve at the end of it.",565.68,2.86
This is quite emphasized.,568.54,3.24
"At the end of the
small intestine",571.78,1.65
"and the beginning of
the large intestine is",573.43,2.23
"the valve, the ileocecal valve,
is what is particularly called.",575.66,7.19
"Predominantly to halt or to
control the flow of nutrients",582.85,4.05
into the large intestine.,586.9,3.5
"The large intestine is almost
a square shaped process.",590.4,4.95
"It ends, as you can see, in
the right lower quadrant,",595.35,3.14
"the end of the small intestine
where your ileocecal valve is",598.49,3.3
dumping into the cecum.,601.79,2.41
"The intestine, the
large intestine,",604.2,2.53
"is one of the more odd
structures, in that you",606.73,2.38
"actually ascend the
first part of it.",609.11,2.41
"And you actually move up into
the right upper quadrant.",611.52,4.196
"It's one of the few
places in your body",615.716,1.624
"that you actually
go against gravity.",617.34,2.7
"The food, at that
point, then moves",620.04,2.34
"across the transverse colon,
down the descending colon,",622.38,2.76
"and into the sigmoid before
it moves into the rectum.",625.14,4.47
"The one thing I will emphasize
on this slide, is the appendix.",629.61,4.24
"It's noted in the right
lower quadrant there,",633.85,1.99
just next to the cecum.,635.84,2.56
"We hear quite frequently
of appendicitis.",638.4,3.3
"It's a frequent
transport for paramedics.",641.7,2.84
"It's right lower quadrant
pain, nausea, vomiting.",644.54,2.72
"We clinically think quite a
bit of appendicitis there.",647.26,3.45
"And so, I will note that
the appendix is actually",650.71,2.3
part of the large intestine.,653.01,2.23
"It looks like a rat tail it's
often frequently described.",655.24,4.11
"We suspect that it plays
parts in the lymphatic system.",659.35,3.47
"It is not actually a part
where the food or the breakdown",662.82,4.99
takes place.,667.81,0.93
"And as you can see
graphically from this,",668.74,1.82
"to take out that appendix
does not significantly",670.56,3.12
"limit your large intestine
in any way, shape, or form.",673.68,3.99
"The large intestine is
about five feet long.",677.67,2.32
"It's responsible, also, for
ending the re-absorption,",679.99,3.97
"electrolytes, and vitamins.",683.96,1.61
It is a very large intestine.,688.14,4.23
"It's much bigger in diameter
than the small intestine.",692.37,2.56
"It's very visually
able to be seen.",694.93,2.91
"It has quite a bit
of arteries that",697.84,4.33
"help keep it very much
rich in blood supply,",702.17,3.73
"as it is such a large object
in your abdominal wall.",705.9,5.24
"Breaking it down
again, the cecum",711.14,2.19
"is the part that the small
intestine material dumps into.",713.33,4.95
It is quite small.,718.28,1.17
It's often described as a pouch.,719.45,2.44
"As you can see, it is
right next to the appendix.",721.89,2.18
"So, if you were to have
a particularly bad bout",724.07,2.86
"of appendicitis,
you could actually",726.93,1.6
"get some cecal irritation,
or infection, with that.",728.53,4.72
"The ascending colon
is in the right side.",733.25,2.83
"It moves from the
lower abdominal wall",736.08,2.2
"up to the upper abdominal wall,
going right near your liver,",738.28,4.1
in the right upper quadrant.,742.38,1.98
"The colon then turns
and heads sideways",744.36,2.04
"from the right side to the left
side in the transverse colon",746.4,4.5
here.,750.9,1.28
"As it continues, the sigmoid
dumps down into the rectum.",752.18,5.72
"The rectum is the very end
of the large intestine.",757.9,2.09
"It is still considered part
of the large intestine.",759.99,3.15
"It's about the last
five to six inches",763.14,2.96
of your large intestines.,766.1,1.31
"And that area is certainly
for your fecal material.",767.41,4.47
"All digestion has been
done at this point in time.",771.88,6.76
"Stepping away from
the actual GI tract,",778.64,2.01
"but looking at your
abdominal cavity as a whole.",780.65,2.89
"If you were a surgeon and you
were to cut into your abdomen,",783.54,2.61
"and you were to look inside,
we divide the abdominal cavity",786.15,3.62
"into three spaces,
the peritoneal cavity,",789.77,2.86
"the retroperitoneal cavity,
and then the pelvic cavity.",792.63,3.99
"These are not very
easy to understand.",796.62,3.22
"This is something that's
often very new for paramedics",799.84,3.13
to understand.,802.97,0.87
"It's very common
that the surgeons",803.84,1.56
"were to speak of
these three spaces.",805.4,2.78
And you may hear a mention.,808.18,2.5
"Particularly, we use it when
somebody's bleeding in there",810.68,3.61
cavities.,814.29,0.66
"The surgeons will
use terms like,",814.95,1.67
"this is a retroperitoneal
bleed, or a peritoneal bleed,",816.62,2.89
"or the bleeding
is in the pelvis.",819.51,2.96
"Different organs are considered
to be in these three spaces,",822.47,3.83
in particular.,826.3,1.76
"And we do appreciate them,
when we open somebody up.",828.06,3.61
"The peritoneal
space contains most",831.67,2.37
"of the organs of
your abdominal area.",834.04,4.23
"It would be more anterior, or in
the front closer to your belly",838.27,3.89
button.,842.16,0.75
"The stomach, the duodenum,
the liver, the gallbladder,",842.91,2.85
"the spleen are all in
this particular area.",845.76,3.05
"So as you can
imagine, a stabbing",848.81,2.95
"near your belly button,
or to your abdomen,",851.76,2.84
"is very likely to cause
a peritoneal bleed.",854.6,4.88
"Towards the back, we
have a couple organs",859.48,2.63
"in this retroperitoneal
space, predominately",862.11,2.23
"the kidneys, the ureters
that come out of the kidneys.",864.34,3.48
"The end of the duodenum, some
colon, and then your pancreas",867.82,3.21
is in the back.,871.03,0.95
"So stabs to your back,
stabs to the sides,",871.98,4.3
"are more likely to cause
a retroperitoneal injury.",876.28,4.33
"And that's a very
common term that we",880.61,1.59
would use in the emergency room.,882.2,1.78
"And a critical care paramedic
transporting a trauma,",883.98,4.526
"it would be very wise
of them to understand",888.506,2.414
"where this bleeding
is coming from,",890.92,1.91
"as we could understand what
organs would be affected",892.83,2.64
"by a peritoneal or
retroperitoneal injury.",895.47,4.71
"The pelvis is in the inferior
part, or the lowest part,",900.18,3.54
of your abdomen.,903.72,1.17
"This contains your
bladder, rectum,",904.89,2.09
"and then the female
ovaries, fallopian tubes.",906.98,6.05
"And so, as you could
imagine, with gravity,",913.03,2.85
"if somebody were walking
around with a bleed,",915.88,1.99
"most of the bleeding,
using gravity,",917.87,2.51
"would fall towards the bottom
of the abdominal compartment,",920.38,3.06
or in the pelvic space.,923.44,1.79
"Any injury to the female
reproductive system",925.23,3.28
would cause pelvic bleeding.,928.51,2.64
"And so that is why
we use these terms,",931.15,2.82
"and I think it's
important that paramedics",933.97,1.89
are familiar with these terms.,935.86,1.49
"Although you won't be able
to clinically diagnose",937.35,2.99
"whether something's in the
peritoneal or retroperitoneal,",940.34,2.8
"but if you get report of one
of these types of issues,",943.14,2.53
"it should help you understand
where exactly they're",945.67,2.51
bleeding from.,948.18,2.595
"Couple other terms
I wanted to mention.",950.775,1.625
"They're not organs
of the GI tract,",952.4,1.83
"they are in the
abdominal cavity.",954.23,2.69
"And they are things that I don't
think our commonly understood",956.92,5.82
"in the layman's
terms, are the ideas",962.74,2.45
of an omentum and a mesentery.,965.19,1.947
"And I wanted to spend a
couple of minutes on these",967.137,2.083
"because many of you may never
have heard these terms before,",969.22,3.77
"but they're quite
important to the surgeons.",972.99,1.85
"And any time a surgeon
opens somebody up,",974.84,2.23
"they're stuck dealing with
the mesentery and omentum.",977.07,3.15
"The mesentery is essentially a
conduit, or a vascular network.",980.22,6.82

a sheet of paper",987.04,2.97

organs so that they don't move.",990.01,3.26

a car, your intestines",993.27,3.37

to the left side.,1001.65,0.77
"Everything kind of stays stuck
to where it's supposed to be.",1002.42,3.3

is this connection",1005.72,3.26

everything where it's supposed",1008.98,4.77

you're running, or",1013.75,2.31
"in an aggressive
athletic activity,",1016.06,3.72
"things don't rearrange
inside of you.",1019.78,3.1
"It's almost like the glue that
keeps everything together.",1022.88,3.31
"And within this area is all the
nerves and the blood vessels",1026.19,3.669
"that run throughout
your abdominal wall.",1029.859,3.21
"And as you could
imagine, if you need",1033.069,2.01

to dissect, or a cut out,",1035.079,3.811
"part of this mesentery in
order to get to the origin.",1038.89,3.59

nicely scoop out your liver.",1042.48,3.05
"You have to kind of cut out
the mesentery, or the glue,",1045.53,4.12
"that sticks this into
its particular area.",1049.65,4.35
"Similarly, is this
idea of the omentum.",1054.0,2.307
There's two of them.,1056.307,0.833
"We call it the greater
and the lesser omentum.",1057.14,3.64
"And it literally looks
like a yellow sheet,",1060.78,3.11
"like a shade that's
on a window that you",1063.89,4.47
"encounter in your
abdominal wall.",1068.36,4.07
"And it is, in the same way,
it's fat, it's adipose tissue.",1072.43,3.38

through the omentum.",1085.32,3.06

this, and the surgeon",1112.22,2.51

omentum and a mesentery",1142.79,3.01
"after those have been
removed or destroyed.",1145.8,3.04
"We've now gone through
the entire GI tract.",1151.81,2.907
We started with the mouth.,1154.717,1.083
We went down the esophagus.,1155.8,1.5
We talked about the stomach.,1157.3,1.47
"We talked about the small
intestine, the large intestine,",1158.77,2.81
and the rectum.,1161.58,0.99

about what all those organs",1162.57,2.41

in that regard.",1164.98,3.6

all these accessory muscles,",1168.58,3.48

help aid all these GI",1172.06,4.66
organs in what they need to do.,1176.72,3.37
"We'll talk quite a bit about
the liver, the gallbladder,",1180.09,2.426
"and the pancreas, as
those are the three most",1182.516,1.874
"important organs
that your body uses.",1184.39,3.01
"The liver is
absolutely gigantic.",1187.4,2.2

easy to palpate,",1192.82,4.35

feel your liver.",1197.17,1.51
"You can feel it often in
babies and in small children.",1198.68,2.97
"It is in the right
upper quadrant.",1201.65,1.7
It's right underneath your ribs.,1203.35,3.59
"And it is divided into two
main parts, the right lobe",1206.94,3.17
and the left lobe.,1210.11,3.2

right down the middle dividing",1213.31,2.89

"The falciform ligament that's
a very visible ligament.",1217.3,4.11
"We see it quite a bit when
we do operations on people.",1221.41,5.41

terres as well.",1226.82,4.021
"And then hiding, as you
can see in this picture,",1230.841,1.999
"directly under the liver
is the gallbladder.",1232.84,2.55
"In fact, they're often what
we call adhered, or stuck",1235.39,3.03
together.,1238.42,0.76
"They're very close in atomic
position to one another.",1239.18,6.34
"The blood supply to the
liver is very important.",1245.52,2.62
"The liver's main job
is detoxification.",1248.14,3.38
You only have one liver.,1251.52,1.73
"You can't live
without your liver.",1253.25,1.8
"And so, most of the blood
through your body at some point",1255.05,3.83
goes through your liver.,1258.88,1.83

blood that runs to your liver,",1260.71,4.19
is the hepatic artery.,1264.9,2.19

one pump of your heart,",1267.09,3.08
"25 percent of that
blood is ultimately",1270.17,2.059
going to go right to the liver.,1272.229,1.291
"That's how important the
liver is to your body.",1273.52,3.67
"And then after the
liver does what",1277.19,2.82
"it needs to do,
the venous output,",1280.01,1.96
"or where the blood comes
out of, is the hepatic vein,",1281.97,3.98
"going directly
into the vena cava.",1285.95,4.02
The liver does quite a bit.,1289.97,1.43
"I don't think that we truly
know everything the liver does.",1291.4,3.61
"We find that the predominant
things that it does",1295.01,2.86
"is number one, is
the regulation of",1297.87,2.06
different metabolic features.,1299.93,2.0
"It helps circulate, break
down, the carbohydrates, fats,",1301.93,3.47
"and amino acids, the
life supply of your body.",1305.4,3.56
"It also helps circulate
new red blood cells.",1308.96,3.0
"It helps to eliminate those
toxins from your body.",1311.96,3.77
"And then it also
produces bile that",1315.73,1.73
"helps break down
fat, in particular.",1317.46,3.92
"After bile is made it
dumps into the gallbladder,",1321.38,2.77
"which is essentially
just a storage device.",1324.15,2.18
"And then it is excreted
into the duodenum.",1326.33,2.96
"And as you recall,
most of them break down",1329.29,2.6
"of all of your nutrients
is in your small intestine.",1331.89,3.55
"And as you remember,
the duodenum",1335.44,2.13
"is the very first part
of your small intestine.",1337.57,2.18
"And so this makes a lot of
sense that the bile that",1339.75,2.89
"helps break down fats,
and all the nutrients",1342.64,3.13
"that your liver
creates is broken down",1345.77,2.45
"into the first part of
the small intestine.",1348.22,2.72
"It's not broken down into
the esophagus or the stomach,",1350.94,2.94
"it's broken down
into small intestine.",1353.88,2.95
"And that predominantly
is because that's",1356.83,1.84
"where the liver does dump
in all of these nutrients.",1358.67,5.19
"The gallbladder, as I
mentioned, is actually",1363.86,2.61
attached to the liver.,1366.47,2.13
"And it will store, and it
will concentrate your bile.",1368.6,3.43
"At times, it will overly
concentrate your bile",1372.03,2.73
"and form gall stones,
which is something",1374.76,2.06
"I think we're all
very familiar with.",1376.82,2.28
"And oftentimes, when
your right upper quadrant",1379.1,2.32
"hurts after food,
the problem is not",1381.42,2.327
"that something's
wrong with you liver,",1383.747,1.583
"but it's often the gallbladder,
because it's directly",1385.33,2.87
behind the liver.,1388.2,2.8
"The gallbladder stores this
bile for when it's used.",1391.0,3.48
"When is it needed, well when you
have a particularly fatty meal.",1394.48,3.55
"Bile only breaks down fats,
not carbohydrates, only fats.",1398.03,5.11
"And so when it is
needed, the cystic duct",1403.14,2.75
"connects the gall
bladder to the duodenum.",1405.89,1.966
"This bile knows it
needs to come out",1411.8,2.27

of CCK, that is to the, go,",1414.07,6.25

will, that the bile is",1420.32,2.94

really is not",1426.76,3.42
a critical organ in your body.,1430.18,2.04

their gall bladder every day.",1432.22,3.64
"It is purely a storage
device for the bile.",1435.86,3.12
"Bile is not made
in the gallbladder.",1438.98,2.06
"And that is a
common test question",1441.04,2.13
"in the critical care is,
where's the bile made?",1443.17,2.56
"The answer is,
actually in the liver.",1445.73,1.8
"The gallbladder is purely
a storage device for it.",1447.53,3.95
"Many people get their
gallbladder removed.",1451.48,1.885
Do they still make bile?,1453.365,1.225
Yes.,1454.59,0.86
"Does the bile still
go into the duodenum?",1455.45,2.11
Yes.,1457.56,0.607
Does it go into the gallbladder?,1458.167,1.333
"No, the gallbladder is
gone at this point in time.",1459.5,3.95
"And so yes, you can live
without your gallbladder.",1463.45,2.6
It is purely the storage device.,1466.05,4.694
"Moving now from the
right upper quadrant",1470.744,1.666
"to really the middle part
of your upper abdomen,",1472.41,2.83
is the pancreas.,1475.24,0.8
"The pancreas is very deep
in your abdominal cavity.",1476.04,3.97
It's near your back.,1480.01,1.09
"It's closer to your spine
than it is to your front.",1481.1,2.64
"Therefore, it's in the
retroperitoneal surface.",1483.74,2.73
"So if your pancreas
were to rupture open,",1486.47,2.017

bleeding, you would",1488.487,1.583

retroperitoneal bleed.",1490.07,2.43

as a gelatinous structure,",1494.38,3.3
like jello.,1497.68,0.97
"You can't just
grab your pancreas",1498.65,1.85
"and whip it out, because
it actually somewhat melts.",1500.5,4.43

blood supply to it",1504.93,2.22
"predominantly through pancreatic
and pancreaticonduodenal",1507.15,3.51
artery.,1510.66,2.06

in very close contact",1512.72,2.92

your small intestine,",1515.64,2.04

awful lot of enzymes.",1519.35,4.01
Some of them are for digestion.,1523.36,2.01

bit about the bile",1525.37,1.99

functions of the pancreas.",1547.1,2.16

common with is insulin.",1549.26,2.86
"If you're a diabetic, you
don't have enough insulin.",1552.12,3.23

was either created wrong,",1555.35,3.36

book doesn't emphasize it,",1565.003,2.706

insulin is the glucagon,",1568.75,2.49

these three accessory organs,",1582.6,2.93

goes in the liver,",1585.53,1.604

close to one another.",1592.29,2.53

it couple of times.",1624.697,1.583

on the GI particular part",1628.87,3.34
"of the physiology, which
is the salivary ducts.",1632.21,2.54

the submandibular glands,",1634.75,4.12

right and left kidney.",1697.51,3.24

is to filter the blood.",1700.75,2.9

sure that your body is not",1703.65,2.29

detoxifies your body,",1705.94,4.37

creates urine.",1710.31,3.39

different parts.",1741.43,2.412

look at one of these nephrons,",1766.38,4.51

we talk about what",2147.93,2.89

or what can go wrong,",2164.65,3.35
in these different tracts.,2168.0,2.69

a bit about GI problems.",2170.69,2.61
"It's unfortunately,
a particular system",2173.3,2.35
that can fail quite often.,2175.65,2.95
"We're going to talk
about not only how",2178.6,1.61
"to assess if something's going
wrong with the GI system,",2180.21,2.68
but ultimately how to treat.,2182.89,1.3
"The first thing we're going
to talk about is GI bleeding.",2187.335,2.375
"I'm sure it's something,
as paramedics,",2189.71,1.74
you have seen quite a bit.,2191.45,1.6
"The first part that we
try to do as physicians",2193.05,2.29
"is trying to figure out
where are they bleeding from.",2195.34,2.49
"We divide it into an upper GI
bleeding and lower GI bleeding.",2197.83,3.8
"And we really try
to inquire, is it",2201.63,1.98
"bleeding from the upper
part, or the lower part?",2203.61,2.017
"Because it's going to make a
difference in the medicines",2205.627,2.333
"we give and how
exactly we treat it.",2207.96,2.1
"And so we ask patients, or
if the patients can't talk,",2210.06,2.884
"we're going to ask
the paramedics,",2212.944,1.416
were they vomiting blood?,2214.36,2.48
"Making me think it's more
of an upper GI problem.",2216.84,2.83
Was it black or tarry stools?,2219.67,2.284
"Which would mean that
the bleeding is probably",2221.954,1.916
"in the upper part
and by the time",2223.87,1.51
"it gets all the
way to the rectum,",2225.38,1.87
"that it's already
black and dark.",2227.25,2.08
"So black stools or
tarry stools are",2229.33,1.92
more of an upper GI problem.,2231.25,2.32
"Or is it actually
bright red blood",2233.57,1.84
that's coming from the rectum?,2235.41,1.61
"And these are things
that are very important.",2237.02,2.02
"So if a patient
calls you and says,",2239.04,1.65
I just bled in the toilet.,2240.69,1.48
"As disgusting as it sounds, it's
very helpful to take a look.",2242.17,3.25
"Is it bright red blood
that's coming out?",2245.42,1.98
"Is it black blood
that's coming out?",2247.4,2.1
"Is it somewhere in between,
almost maroon, or purple blood?",2249.5,3.94
"That will help us tell
if the bleeding is coming",2253.44,2.11
"from the stomach,
the small intestine,",2255.55,1.84
or the large intestine.,2257.39,1.717
"The other part of GI
bleeding that we like to know",2259.107,2.083
"is, is it briskly bleeding?",2261.19,1.49
"Are they actively
bleeding right now?",2262.68,1.68
"Is there blood on your
sheets from the transport in?",2264.36,3.33
"And how long has this
bleeding been going on for?",2267.69,3.84
We always talk about ABCs.,2271.53,2.14
"We want to make sure that if
the patient's bleeding is very",2273.67,2.67
"brisk, that we're
monitoring their airway,",2276.34,1.93
"we're checking
their vital signs.",2278.27,1.39
Are they very tachycardic?,2279.66,1.31
"Is their blood
pressure very low?",2280.97,2.09
Is it hard to feel pulses?,2283.06,1.62
Are they very threaded pulses?,2284.68,1.34
"These are all
things that we need",2286.02,2.16
"to know when we're
managing a GI bleed.",2288.18,2.88
I wouldn't feed anybody.,2291.06,1.63
There should be no water.,2292.69,1.409
"Nothing to eat or drink when
they're having a GI bleed,",2294.099,2.291
"because the ultimate
problem is that food may",2296.39,3.63
"obstruct our views to see
where they're bleeding from.",2300.02,3.58
"And so make sure that the
patient doesn't eat or drink",2303.6,2.27
"anything when you get
in contact with them.",2305.87,3.6
GI bleeding can be very fatal.,2309.47,2.21
"We have a lot of
medications that",2311.68,1.93
"can thin your blood that can
make bleeding very worse.",2313.61,2.93
"It feels like everybody
nowadays is either",2316.54,1.84
"on aspirin, Plavix, Coumadin.",2318.38,2.31
"There's these new
medications out there",2320.69,2.58
that can also thin your blood.,2323.27,1.65
"And so we get very
aggressive with making",2324.92,1.91
"sure there are two
IVs in these patients.",2326.83,2.37
We want large-bore IVs.,2329.2,1.81
"We want to get very
aggressive in making sure",2331.01,2.31
"that we can stabilize
these patients.",2333.32,2.32
"Even if they're not
briskly bleeding right now,",2335.64,3.04
"your entire GI tract
could be filled with blood",2338.68,2.82
"and we just don't know yet
how bad this bleeding is.",2341.5,3.01
"So I would urge
paramedics, particularly",2344.51,2.37
"with long transports,
for a GI bleed patient",2346.88,3.39
"to be very aggressive in
getting that second IV in place.",2350.27,2.98
"And not just settling for
a 22-guage IV in the thumb.",2353.25,3.867
"But really putting in
aggressive antecubital",2357.117,1.833
"IVs in these GI
bleeding patients.",2358.95,4.37
"We fluid resusc
these patients, we",2363.32,1.65
"don't want them
to go into shock.",2364.97,1.56
"We're very aggressive with
starting normal saline boluses",2366.53,3.91
in these patients.,2370.44,1.26
"When they get to
the emergency room,",2371.7,1.51
"we're very aggressive
in making sure",2373.21,1.55
"that we're typing and
crossing their blood type.",2374.76,2.72
"That we are ready to give them
more blood, if at all possible.",2377.48,4.0
"We would encourage
the paramedics,",2381.48,2.49
"if you are able to give
blood, that if blood",2383.97,2.6
"is being hung for a GI
patient, I want a critical care",2386.57,2.93
"paramedic that is capable of
continuing that blood in route,",2389.5,3.49
"because that is ultimately what
the patient is going to need.",2392.99,2.77
"Blood loss of anything
over about a liter,",2398.51,2.55
"a liter and a half,
is going to need",2401.06,1.61
"to start to have
blood replacement.",2402.67,2.19
"And it is very easy to lose a
liter of blood in the GI tract,",2404.86,4.95
it's very long.,2409.81,1.08
"If your stomach is
bleeding, by the time",2410.89,2.16
"it moves all the way through
the pyloric sphincter",2413.05,2.95
"through your small intestine,
your large intestine,",2416.0,2.54
"that entire area can
be filled with blood.",2418.54,2.42
"And if they have one
urge to defecate,",2420.96,2.14
"and they lose all
that blood, it's",2423.1,1.79
"very easy that you're
already needing blood supply.",2424.89,3.4
"And so that's why we
get very aggressive",2428.29,1.95
with these GI bleeding.,2430.24,1.9
"And we want you to really
watch the human dynamics.",2432.14,2.61
"The first sign that the
bleeding may be severe",2434.75,2.04
would be some mild tachycardia.,2436.79,2.32
"They may feel a
little weak and dizzy",2439.11,1.81
"when you stand them
to get onto your cot.",2440.92,2.1
"Those are all things we need
to know as the physicians,",2443.02,3.29
"because those are signs
that this GI bleeding could",2446.31,2.85
be very extreme.,2449.16,1.66
We like to watch them on EKGs.,2450.82,2.25
"All this blood loss can
lead to arrhythmias.",2453.07,2.18
The heart can suffer from this.,2455.25,1.73
"It's not uncommon to actually
suffer a small heart attack",2456.98,2.89
"while having a GI bleed
because of the blood loss.",2459.87,3.61

on the cardiac monitor.",2463.48,2.9

what their heart rate is.",2466.38,2.884

and the heart rate",2469.264,1.541

bleeding onto your cot",2478.03,3.25

internally into their GI tract.",2481.28,3.22

like, are they incontinent?",2484.5,2.83
"Are they having a large
amount of diarrhea?",2487.33,2.24
Are they constipated?,2489.57,1.0
Have they been vomiting all day?,2490.57,2.04

factors that we",2492.61,1.97

our paramedics.",2494.58,3.76

times more common than lower.",2498.34,3.82

about 10% in these.",2529.75,1.94

are stomach ulcers.",2564.62,1.87

they need to have an endoscopy.",3612.26,4.11

how big is the blood vessel?",3620.0,3.09

diverticular bleeds just",3623.09,3.14

on how many they",3627.49,1.76
"have, how many times
they're bleeding,",3629.25,1.93
sometimes they need surgery.,3631.18,2.31
"The way we tell this is that
we do what's called, endoscopy.",3633.49,2.97
"We put a camera either down
their mouth or up their rectum,",3636.46,3.42
"and we are able to
visualize what is going on.",3639.88,3.0
"Now this can be a little
difficult at times.",3642.88,3.8
"If they're bleeding
quite heavily,",3646.68,1.48

suction to really see",3648.16,2.95

is coming from.",3651.11,2.49
"If they're bleeding
too briskly, we",3653.6,2.12

the bleeding is coming from.",3655.72,2.53
"Secondarily, if they just
ate a Big Mac on the way in,",3658.25,3.08

get in the way of seeing",3661.33,2.99

thing that we start with to try",3673.34,3.51

can do is we can",3680.2,2.39
"do what we call a tagged
red blood cell scan.",3682.59,4.1

some red blood cells,",3686.69,2.28

We take out your blood.,3694.7,0.98
We put this tag on.,3695.68,1.16
"And we actually put the
blood back into your body.",3696.84,2.64

of your GI tract.",3699.48,2.63
"And we try to figure out
where those tagged blood",3702.11,3.04
"cells are coming out
and bleeding from.",3705.15,2.67

GI doctors, and our surgeons,",3707.82,2.87
"a clue for what part of the
GI tract is bleeding from.",3710.69,3.41
"Do those red blood
cells come out",3714.1,1.52
"from the stomach, the small
intestine, the large intestine?",3715.62,3.502
"We also use this if
we think that they're",3719.122,1.708
bleeding in the small intestine.,3720.83,2.01
"If we do what's called an EGD,
or we do an endoscopy down",3722.84,4.49

only get to the duodenum.",3727.33,3.81
"We cannot scope from the mouth
and get all the way through",3731.14,3.19
the GI tract.,3734.33,1.26
"Similarly, when we
do a colonoscopy,",3735.59,2.02
"we can only get to the ileum, or
the and of the small intestine.",3737.61,6.38
"And so, most of the duodenum,
the ileum, and the jejunum,",3743.99,4.45
we can't get with endoscopy.,3748.44,1.93
"And if we think you're
bleeding in that middle part,",3750.37,3.58
"these tagged red
blood cell scans",3753.95,1.77
"are something that we can
use, because endoscopy",3755.72,2.47
won't help us.,3758.19,2.44
"The other thing that's rarely
done nowadays that we can do",3760.63,2.45
"is, we can actually
poke somebody",3763.08,1.78
"in a leg, or an artery, and
we can snake a little coil up,",3764.86,4.89
"and we can actually put it in
all these different arteries,",3769.75,2.89
"and see which one
has broken loose.",3772.64,2.5
"Now that's a lot of contrast,
that's a very invasive study.",3775.14,3.1

somebody to sleep.",3778.24,1.79
"You have to snake these
angiography coils into all",3780.03,5.12

to see what is bleeding,",3785.15,2.4

we have to do angiography,",3787.55,3.27

done nowadays in particular.",3790.82,4.01

because it is so common,",3794.83,2.36

with ABCs, normal saline,",3803.06,4.83

them on a cardiac monitor,",3807.89,2.98

of other things",3814.14,1.96
that we do in rare instances.,3816.1,1.69
"We'll talk about some
balloon tamponade.",3817.79,1.83
We'll talk about octreotide.,3819.62,1.91
"Octreotide, balloon
tamponade, TIPS procedures,",3821.53,3.3
"are all used for these variceal
bleeds, these cirrhotics who",3824.83,3.98
"can rupture open veins
anywhere in their GI tract.",3828.81,5.2
"We'll show you a picture of a
balloon, the Blakemore Tube,",3834.01,3.49
in a little bit.,3837.5,1.49
"Octreotide is a medicine
that is given as a drip.",3838.99,2.37
It won't help all GI bleeds.,3841.36,1.78
"It really only
helps patients who",3843.14,2.06
are having a variceal bleed.,3845.2,2.15
"TIPS is an emergency
surgery where",3847.35,1.82
"we try to decrease the
pressure in these veins.",3849.17,3.53
"You can't do it
while somebody is",3852.7,1.56
"having an active,
variceal bleed,",3854.26,2.7
"but it is a liver
surgery that can",3856.96,2.72
"be done to try to
decrease the pressure.",3859.68,2.77
"And so if you have a patient
who is having a GI bleed,",3862.45,2.63
"and they tell, aw, I've
had a TIPS procedure done,",3865.08,2.63
"or I've a couple of
TIPS procedures done,",3867.71,3.709
"you should be very concerned
that what they're actually",3871.419,2.291
having is a variceal bleed.,3873.71,3.82
"And I'll mention NG
tubes now, quite a bit.",3877.53,2.781
"We're going to show
you very briefly",3880.311,1.499
"how to put these in later
in this presentation.",3881.81,3.59
"But if you put an NG tube down
the nose into the stomach,",3885.4,3.71
"and what's coming up
is bright red blood,",3889.11,2.01
"you can be very concerned
that that bleeding",3891.12,2.32
"is coming from the
esophagus, or the stomach.",3893.44,2.62
"If they're vomiting blood,
you put an NG tube down,",3896.06,2.8
"and all that's coming
up is stomach acid,",3898.86,1.86
"yellowish-green stuff,
but no blood, then you",3900.72,2.744
"can assume that the
bleeding is probably",3903.464,1.666
"coming from lower in
the small intestine,",3905.13,2.46
"or the large intestine, or
the bleeding has stopped.",3907.59,3.72
"So putting down
an NG tube allows",3911.31,2.73
"us to analyze the contents
of what is coming up,",3914.04,2.71
"and help us ascertain where
this bleeding is coming from.",3916.75,3.18
"Oftentimes, we will give
antacids in these GI bleeds",3923.39,3.71
"because peptic ulcers
are so common for causing",3927.1,3.52
these bleeds.,3930.62,0.59
"And so, you'll very commonly see
us give IV antacid medications,",3931.21,5.32
"in an attempt to
try to help heal",3936.53,1.8
the ulcers that have worn away.,3938.33,2.7
"And so, I put this slide in
only because you will frequently",3941.03,2.75
"transport somebody who
is on an antacid drip.",3943.78,2.95
"The most common we
see is IV protonics.",3946.73,3.124
"And it would be very
common for you to show up",3949.854,1.916
"to transport a patient
having, most likely,",3951.77,2.3
"an upper GI bleed
from peptic ulcers,",3954.07,2.33
"and they'll be getting
IV fluid, possibly blood,",3956.4,3.3
"and they may be on a
protonics drip as well.",3959.7,2.76
"And that is because
we are assuming",3962.46,1.79
"that this is ultimately
a peptic ulcer bleed.",3964.25,2.44
Endoscopy is very common.,3969.77,1.73
"We can see the bleeding
quite actively.",3971.5,2.29
"The nice thing about
doing these endoscopies",3973.79,2.44
"is not only can we see the
ulcer, the diverticular",3976.23,2.39
"bleed, the Mallory-Weiss, the
varices that are bleeding,",3978.62,4.98
but we're also able to fix them.,3983.6,2.29
"These are done by
GI specialists,",3985.89,1.77
"we don't do them as an
emergency physician.",3987.66,2.27
"There are some surgeons
that can do this",3989.93,1.91
"so that they can analyze if
the bleeding is brisk enough",3991.84,3.21
"that they actually need
to take them to surgery.",3995.05,3.254
"But you can often, they'll
come down to the emergency room",3998.304,2.416
and do this.,4000.72,1.88
"And this is usually they go
to that we will ultimately",4002.6,3.41
"do to not only figure out what
the bleeding is coming from,",4006.01,4.25
"but they can also
inject epinephrine.",4010.26,2.39
"They can try to
coil the bleeding.",4012.65,2.55
"And endoscopy, in
most situations,",4015.2,2.31
"are actually able to fix the
bleeding within endoscopy.",4017.51,3.97
"And then, they'll go in
days, to weeks, later",4021.48,2.78
"and they will watch
the bleeding to make",4024.26,1.78
"sure it hasn't re-blood, to make
sure the ulcers are healing up.",4026.04,3.59
"And so endoscopy
is really the way",4029.63,2.37
"that we can
identify, ultimately,",4032.0,2.35
what this bleeding is.,4034.35,1.12
"And we can often
fix the bleeding",4035.47,2.34
"by injecting medicines or
coils through an endoscopy",4037.81,4.43

the other pathology",4047.75,2.22

we see is pancreatitis.",4052.04,3.21

pain, nausea, and vomiting,",4055.25,4.11

about pancreatitis.",4059.36,2.53

are very toxic to the body.",4061.89,3.8
"A lot of the breakdown
of your food can occur.",4065.69,4.74

gets inflamed,",4070.43,2.96

all those enzymes,",4073.39,2.96

into overdrive.",4076.35,2.025
"An inflamed pancreas can be
an extraordinarily painful",4081.52,4.14
phenomenon.,4085.66,0.65
"You'll see patients yelling,
screaming, writhing in pain",4086.31,3.78
with it.,4090.09,0.71
"All of that pain is due to
the release of these enzymes",4090.8,2.65
that the pancreas produces.,4093.45,2.18
"And the blood flow
to the pancreas,",4095.63,2.5
"and the fact that the pancreas
is in the retroperitoneum,",4098.13,2.49
"and it's very deep,
makes this pain",4100.62,2.6
"to be very profound
for patients.",4103.22,3.19
They're often nauseous.,4106.41,1.11
They're often vomiting.,4107.52,2.11

releases of all these enzymes",4109.63,3.21

released so aggressively.",4112.84,4.86

pancreatitis can be",4117.7,3.949

complications that",4129.77,1.66

serious, GI pathology.",4164.135,3.835

normally flow very nicely",4181.88,4.45

more, and more enzymes.",4193.66,2.43

"Some of the complications that
can happen from pancreatitis",4257.56,3.41
"is that the pancreas,
with all these enzymes",4260.97,2.79

also wear a way into a blood",4263.76,2.614
"vessel, and they can
have some bleeding.",4266.374,1.666

pancreatitis.",4268.04,2.454

signs we see of that",4270.494,1.666
"is called Gray Turner's
or Cullen's sign.",4272.16,3.22

get some bruising,",4275.38,3.41

around the belly button,",4278.79,2.75

something that is quite rare.",4281.54,3.95

that we should be looking for,",4285.49,3.16

pancreatitis has converted",4288.65,2.95
to a hemorrhagic pancreatitis.,4291.6,2.93
"The way we check for
it in the hospitals,",4294.53,2.02
"we can check to
see what the level",4296.55,2.07
of these pancreatic enzymes are.,4298.62,2.34
"Now we can't check for every
enzyme in the blood work,",4300.96,2.39
"and the most common we look
for is amylase and lipase.",4303.35,3.41

more sensitive, and specific.",4306.76,3.46

will only check lipase.",4310.22,2.8

the amylase and the lipase.",4313.02,3.18

elevated, we get concerns",4316.2,2.7

pancreatitis because there's",4318.9,2.295

enzymes in the blood.",4321.195,4.745

of other data points,",4325.94,2.79

that you can understand where",4328.73,2.74

how sick this pancreatitis is.",4331.47,3.777

they're very anemic.",4338.87,2.49

calcium is very low.",4342.78,2.11

look like it's",4375.13,1.5

pancreatitis is.",4384.33,3.9

patients to make sure",4394.565,3.145

their pancreatitis is.",4397.71,3.537

with pancreatitis that we need",4401.247,2.583

can, what's called, form cysts,",4403.83,3.01

are just like an abscess,",4406.84,4.56

secondary to pancreatitis,",4411.4,3.72

with your finger, or a piece",4952.995,2.375

long to stick the tube down.",4955.37,5.54

so it goes down very smoothly.",4960.91,4.89
"And when you put it
in the nose, you often",4965.8,2.39
"want to put it
straight back, and we",4968.19,1.78

medical students, paramedics,",4969.97,3.91

back, the tube",4984.94,1.52

drink, or sip, water",4990.26,2.75

open up the esophagus.",4993.01,3.82

resolve itself",5014.75,1.72

the placement is just so.",5047.2,3.27

can listen over the stomach,",5053.8,3.22

back a little bit,",5067.25,1.72

in my opinion, is",5075.81,1.51

very long, and they",5131.37,1.78

to a problem with one",5206.69,3.24

the duodenum, that",5224.55,1.62

G part of the tube.",5252.2,2.71

the J part of the tube,",5254.91,3.3

they just happen",5261.93,2.37

taped down and secured.",5268.49,3.324

there's no bleeding, infection,",5271.814,2.416

is the specimen that's",5339.66,2.94

have a T tube in place,",5343.63,3.25

couple of things.",5346.88,1.79

draining out is bile.",5352.78,2.325

at risk for either",5458.882,1.458

"An air embolism is just
what it sounds like.",5471.99,2.03

you're changing these IVs.",5478.03,3.87

given in a regular IV.",5481.9,3.47

a pick line, or a central line,",5485.37,4.44

a major blood vessel, not",5489.81,2.96

are transported",5502.28,1.9

often, long periods of time,",5520.17,3.8

to these bleeds.",5605.04,4.79

put them on a pulley system",5609.83,3.95

them, and then we",5613.78,1.88

so that it is nice and taut.",5615.66,3.76

ways of doing this,",5619.42,3.19

putting down an NG tube,",5625.79,4.23

a Blakemore tube,",5630.02,2.58

the Blakemore tube",5632.6,1.86
"to the face guard of
a football helmet.",5634.46,3.53

in the storage rooms of the ER",5637.99,3.84

helmet in the storage room?",5641.83,3.34

most often, in case",5645.17,2.84
"we have one of these
bad variceal bleeds.",5648.01,2.145
"Internally, they
look like this, where",5652.93,1.94

try to tamponade right",5654.87,2.77

stomach border.",5657.64,3.95

of these tubes are put in.",5679.1,6.23

large amount of blood,",5688.79,2.09

fluids, and blood.",5690.88,2.93

of you will ever see a Blakemore",5696.26,3.84

variceal tube placed.",5700.1,3.294

at least make sure",5703.394,1.416

intubating the patient",5713.86,2.46
"before transporting, if
they have one of these in.",5716.32,3.67

a big concern,",5719.99,2.28
"would be that you
inflate the balloon",5722.27,1.84

gets so dilated, that you're",5724.11,2.94

tied, and that they don't",5746.35,3.96

talk about, is an ostomy bag.",5762.3,3.31

a bit about these ostomies,",5792.61,3.33

can see, are they pink?",5839.31,4.15

look at that intestine",5879.03,2.76

of the wound.,6175.13,1.78
"They are open on one side,
and so the blood or the pus",6176.91,2.86
"will often just drain
right out from them.",6179.77,2.49
"Therefore, some four-by-fours,
or some gauze around them,",6182.26,3.66
would be very good idea.,6185.92,2.43
They're often stitched in there.,6188.35,1.36
They don't come out.,6189.71,1.18
"We often stitch
those into place.",6190.89,2.019
"But I want to make
you aware of them,",6192.909,1.541
"so that you know what a
Penrose drain looks like.",6194.45,4.96
"A little bit more formal
than a Penrose drain,",6199.41,2.06
"is what we call a JP drain,
or a Jackson-Pratt drain.",6201.47,3.13
"They're often called
grenade drains, as well.",6204.6,3.24
"The interesting
thing about these,",6207.84,1.53
"is these are often to
collect blood, in a surgical.",6209.37,2.82
You can place them anyway.,6212.19,1.12
"They're very common
after breast surgeries,",6213.31,1.94
"neck surgeries,
abdominal surgeries.",6215.25,2.5
There's often more than one.,6217.75,1.23
"I've seen up to five or six of
them placed in big surgeries.",6218.98,3.88
"The thing about them is
that they are under suction.",6222.86,3.07
"And so if the grenade
is fully blown up,",6225.93,2.28
"or looks like a grenade,
they need to be opened,",6228.21,2.58
and they need to be emptied.,6230.79,2.06
"But for the suction to
actually be activated,",6232.85,2.77
"you have to squeeze them so
that there are flattened,",6235.62,4.17
"and then you close them for
the suction to actually work.",6239.79,4.21
"That they will not
work, if they're just",6244.0,1.72
kept in the grenade fashion.,6245.72,3.26
"The hemovac drain,
looks similar.",6248.98,2.82
"They're a little more rigid than
then the Jackson-Pratt drain.",6251.8,3.68
They will be the same thing.,6255.48,1.53
"They will be held into
place by a stitch,",6257.01,3.2
"and they will slowly
drain the blood.",6260.21,2.31
"They are a little
harder than the usual,",6262.52,3.05
"but they are drained
by the same exact way.",6265.57,2.12
"They must be flattened in
order for the suction to work.",6267.69,3.02
"They work exactly
similar to a JP drain,",6270.71,3.36
"but they are circular
instead of grenade.",6274.07,1.865
"Peritoneal dialysis
is very common.",6278.75,2.48
"We see these patients
often able to manage",6281.23,3.14
at home all by themselves.,6284.37,1.54
"Unlike patients who have a
fistule in their arm or leg,",6285.91,4.45
"peritoneal dialysis is
done in the abdomen, often",6290.36,2.56
the lower abdomen.,6292.92,1.95
"Peritoneal dialysis
is often done at night",6294.87,2.9
while the patient sleeps.,6297.77,1.4
"They are often able to
manage it all by themselves.",6299.17,2.65
"Unfortunately, because people
do it all by themselves,",6301.82,2.84
"these drains can get
infected, and their abdomen",6304.66,2.17
"can get infected,
so-called peritonitis.",6306.83,3.53
"These patients are
actually often smart enough",6310.36,2.06
"that they can give themselves
IV antibiotics at home,",6312.42,3.27
"through the drain, when
they start to get infected.",6315.69,3.48
"Unfortunately, these
catheters can fall out,",6319.17,2.19
"the infections can
get quite severe,",6321.36,2.75
"and they can be called
for transport in.",6324.11,3.67
"Any newly placed catheter
is at risk for bleeding.",6327.78,3.0
"So please make sure
they're properly secure,",6330.78,1.855
"that the patient, or
yourself, doesn't accidentally",6332.635,2.125
"pull them out while
being transferred.",6334.76,2.569
"And please note, that
these catheters often",6337.329,1.791
"go very deep, even into
the retroperitoneal area,",6339.12,3.9
"or the pelvic area,
of the abdomen.",6343.02,2.989
"And so you want to be very
cautious with removing them,",6346.009,2.291
"because there could be
up to a foot, even more,",6348.3,2.35
"of the catheter actually
into the patient.",6350.65,2.43
"A general checklist
for all these tubes",6355.79,2.32
"certainly needs to be considered
by a critical care paramedic.",6358.11,2.96
"You want to know what's their
purpose, what fluid is coming",6361.07,3.22
"out of them, is it properly
secured, has it been emptied,",6364.29,3.46
"what are the potential
complications",6367.75,2.6
that can arise from these tubes.,6370.35,2.51
"So that you sound knowledgeable,
and that you're up to date",6372.86,3.34
"on what these lines
are for these patients",6376.2,2.97
"when they are taken
into the hospital.",6379.17,4.66
That's my last slide for this.,6383.83,2.52
This has been a long lecture.,6386.35,1.29
"There's a lot of
information in it.",6387.64,1.68
"It's exhausting, not only to
lecture about, but to hear.",6389.32,5.0
There's a lot of anatomy.,6394.32,1.46
"There's a lot of
physiology to take in.",6395.78,2.17
"I did not read every
slide verbatim.",6397.95,1.77
"Please make sure you're reading
the book referencing the slides",6399.72,4.06
"to make sure that you are
aware of all the information.",6403.78,4.76
"This is not an exhaustive
anatomy and physiology lecture,",6408.54,4.43
"nor is it a
patho-physiology lecture.",6412.97,2.4
"There's a lot that can go
wrong in the GI and GU tracts.",6415.37,3.28
"I've tried to cover the most
important pathologies that",6418.65,4.19
can occur.,6422.84,0.98
"I tried to cover what we use, as
physicians, to try to alleviate",6423.82,4.28
"these pathologies, talking about
endoscopies, the various tubes",6428.1,3.31
"that we use, how
we deal with all",6431.41,2.65
these different pathologies.,6434.06,2.48
"Please ask questions,
share experiences,",6436.54,2.85
"discuss what you have done
during these transport",6439.39,2.5
"to make them as
easy as possible.",6441.89,3.58
"It takes quite a lot of
time to wrap your head",6445.47,2.03
around this chapter.,6447.5,1.42
"There's a lot of information,
and please make sure",6448.92,2.36
"that you are revisiting
it over, and over again,",6451.28,3.31
"as one time through
this material",6454.59,2.09
is not going to be sufficient.,6456.68,3.55
"And please, make sure that
you're looking at the diagrams,",6460.23,3.31
"trying to get a visual of how
all these different diseases,",6463.54,3.61
"the anatomy, flows together.",6467.15,2.077
"Make sure that you
understand when something",6469.227,1.833
"goes wrong with the patient
that you are understanding why",6471.06,2.416
"it is going wrong, and what
are the potential complications",6473.476,3.194
that can occur in route.,6476.67,3.09
But I'll leave it at that.,6479.76,1.21
"And make sure that
you're asking questions,",6480.97,2.8
and understand the material.,6483.77,1.6
Thank you for your time.,6485.37,2.07
