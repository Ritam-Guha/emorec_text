"The topic this week is BMI, or Body Mass Index.",15.269,4.891
"Body Mass Index is a calculation that is made
on the basis of your height and weight that",20.16,5.171
"will categorize you in terms of where you
are with your weight.",25.331,3.909
"Either being underweight, at an ideal weight,
overweight, or significantly overweight--or",29.24,4.74
obese.,33.98,1.0
"Now we use this as a guide for who is a good
candidate for body contouring surgery because",34.98,5.219
"body contouring surgery is not weight loss
surgery.",40.199,3.211
"So the question we asked is this: You need
to have a Body Mass Index of 30 or less to",43.41,5.59
be a good candidate for a tummy tuck or abdomiplasty.,49.0,4.73
And the answer is True.,53.73,1.89
"This is perhaps my preference, but I think
it's a good general guideline, that you should",55.62,4.45
"be at a reasonable weight prior to body contouring
surgery and I use a Body Mass Index of 30",60.07,6.73
as a cut off.,66.8,1.79
"Sometimes there's some wiggle room in there,
but the reason I do this is because the results",68.59,4.639
"of the procedures are better
and they are safer if you are at a better,",73.229,6.071
more healthy weight.,79.3,1.26
And so we use Body Mass Index as a guideline.,80.56,2.19
"Now many people say, ""Well how do I know what
my Body Mass Index is?""",82.75,3.72
That's a very good question.,86.47,1.399
"We put on our web page a calculator where
you put in your height and your weight and",87.869,4.931
"it will show you what your Body Mass Index
is.",92.8,1.9
"And it also gives you the guidelines of where
you want to be.",94.7,3.869
"So if you're wondering what your Body Mass
Index is, go to our website, click on the",98.569,5.151
"page for the Tummy Tuck, and you'll find it
there.",103.72,2.85
