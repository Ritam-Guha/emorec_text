hello let's look at a medication called,0.08,3.04
increasing,2.32,2.56
this is a combination with the dpp4,3.12,3.44
inhibitor which is alloglifting,4.88,3.6
together with the pioglitazone that's,6.56,4.079
this thiazolidine dion,8.48,5.68
so we know we can give allogliptin 25mg,10.639,4.561
once daily,14.16,3.52
and we will do that with increasing also,15.2,3.44
so increasing,17.68,4.16
can be given 25 milligram forward slash,18.64,6.399
then 30 milligram of pioglitazone or 45,21.84,5.359
milligram of pioglitazone depending on,25.039,3.361
how much we want,27.199,2.801
if we have a kidney insufficiency then,28.4,3.839
we need to give less of increasing,30.0,4.64
then we need to give 12.5 milligram of,32.239,3.521
allogliptin,34.64,4.16
forward slash uh for example uh 30,35.76,5.28
milligram of pm glytozone or 45,38.8,4.079
of p glycozone and this is when we have,41.04,3.44
kidney insufficiency which means,42.879,4.16
around 30 to 60 milliliters per minute,44.48,3.68
of gfr,47.039,3.281
everything above 60 is the normal dose,48.16,3.36
one once daily,50.32,3.68
everything that is 30 to 60 milliliters,51.52,3.12
then we give,54.0,3.84
this a half dose of aloe,54.64,5.28
and if we have less than 30 milliliters,57.84,3.84
per minute then it's contraindicated,59.92,2.959
because pioglitazone,61.68,4.08
is not allowed to be given in kidney,62.879,4.801
sufficiency of less than 30 milliliters,65.76,3.12
per minute,67.68,3.119
allogliptin is so when we give,68.88,3.52
allogliptin alloglyptin alone,70.799,3.281
which is for example we dealt with that,72.4,3.68
in another video the pedia,74.08,5.2
so vpedia is allogliptin alone then we,76.08,4.079
can go,79.28,4.879
down as long as 6.25 milligram,80.159,7.041
for a gfr which is less than 30,84.159,4.241
milliliters per minute,87.2,3.04
remember this but because of,88.4,3.52
pioglitazone we are not,90.24,4.8
allowed to give increasing below 30,91.92,4.559
milliliter per minute,95.04,4.16
so please remember that we we know we,96.479,4.0
have different combinations of,99.2,2.16
allogliptin,100.479,3.041
today we're discussing increasing we,101.36,4.0
have the uh vpedia which,103.52,3.919
alloglyptin alone and then we have,105.36,4.16
allogliptin together with metformin,107.439,4.801
that could be vip domet so we have,109.52,3.279
different,112.24,2.559
names here and and united states and,112.799,3.92
europe have also a different names for,114.799,2.561
example,116.719,3.601
increasing would be called oseni very,117.36,4.48
interesting name so this is a very,120.32,3.68
strange name that is hard to remember,121.84,3.44
actually uh,124.0,4.0
the main thing for a doctor is actually,125.28,3.679
to remember,128.0,3.2
the substance name there that's the most,128.959,4.561
important so please remember allogliptin,131.2,3.679
can be given together with the p,133.52,3.76
ognetazone and that's in then you need,134.879,4.161
to remember the groups as we said,137.28,4.16
uh allogliptin was a dpp for inhibitor,139.04,5.199
and the pioglitaz,141.44,2.799
and the combination that can be uh,145.04,5.76
given with increasing is for example,148.239,3.441
metformin,150.8,3.519
so then we have actually uh allogliptin,151.68,4.559
a piaglitazone and metformin,154.319,4.241
the ones that you should not combine,156.239,3.681
increasing with,158.56,4.319
is another dpp4 inhibitor because we,159.92,3.84
already have,162.879,3.44
one alloglyptin please don't add another,163.76,3.759
one,166.319,3.441
please don't add the glp-1 agonist,167.519,3.121
together with this,169.76,4.24
because glp-1 agonist and dp4 agonist,170.64,5.52
actually do the same thing but they,174.0,4.0
don't have an additive effect,176.16,5.359
meaning it's useless it's it's not good,178.0,7.2
so don't do dp4 don't do with glp1,181.519,6.321
and don't combine with insulin and don't,185.2,4.8
combine with sulfonylurea,187.84,5.44
combine it either with ah so rather with,190.0,5.36
metformin please remember this,193.28,4.72
let's look at which side effects do we,195.36,3.12
have,198.0,3.28
of increasing we have for example,198.48,3.92
headache,201.28,3.76
then we can have blurred vision we have,202.4,4.24
nasal pharyngitis,205.04,3.36
we can have upper respiratory tract,206.64,3.28
infection so i'm going from,208.4,4.0
uh upwards to than downwards then we,209.92,3.679
have for example,212.4,4.0
acute pancreatitis we can have increased,213.599,3.441
liver,216.4,4.08
enzymes and then we can have,217.04,6.0
bladder cancer bladder cancer this is,220.48,3.119
very,223.04,2.88
interesting bladder cancer but this is,223.599,3.841
all a rare side effect,225.92,3.12
please don't be afraid whenever i'm,227.44,3.12
talking about side effects these are,229.04,2.16
very,230.56,2.72
rare you will not get bladder cancer,231.2,3.119
okay this is,233.28,3.12
one in i don't know how many thousand,234.319,3.041
and this is,236.4,2.479
really rare so you don't have to be,237.36,3.439
afraid of that so bladder cancer then we,238.879,3.64
have low back pain,240.799,4.08
arthralgias we're meaning we have a,242.519,3.401
joint pain,244.879,4.72
it can be skin uh prudent as we call it,245.92,4.879
so it's skin,249.599,4.64
reddening there can also be weight gain,250.799,6.56
weight gain with this type and also,254.239,7.761
a hypoglycemia we usually know that,257.359,7.761
weight is actually neutral or reduced,262.0,5.04
with the dpp4 inhibitors,265.12,5.04
but since we have a pioglitazone here,267.04,6.08
then we also can see weight gain so due,270.16,4.64
to the p of glycosome but otherwise,273.12,3.44
please remember that the dp4,274.8,3.92
inhibitors are very good for keeping the,276.56,3.68
weight or actually reducing,278.72,2.96
the weight which are the,280.24,3.36
contraindication when are we not allowed,281.68,2.4
to give,283.6,2.56
increasing so allogliptin or,284.08,3.6
pioglitazone,286.16,5.2
for example uh the the common one for,287.68,5.6
both of these substances would be heart,291.36,3.76
failure type three or four,293.28,6.8
or liver insufficiency type 1 diabetes,295.12,8.079
diabetic ketoacidosis this would be,300.08,6.52
the common ones and then for for example,303.199,6.401
pioglitazone we would then have a,306.6,6.76
macro hematuria or bladder cancer,309.6,6.159
this is two that would be more for,313.36,4.399
pioglitazone due to piolitazone,315.759,3.28
contraindication,317.759,2.88
and then we would have acute,319.039,4.16
pancreatitis for allogliptin,320.639,4.881
so these are the main contraindications,323.199,4.161
that can be seen for both,325.52,4.399
medications and then some special for,327.36,4.64
pyoglitazole and some are special,329.919,4.241
for allogliptin i think this will be,332.0,3.36
enough for today i think,334.16,3.12
thank you very much for listening and,335.36,5.279
have a nice day bye bye,337.28,3.359
