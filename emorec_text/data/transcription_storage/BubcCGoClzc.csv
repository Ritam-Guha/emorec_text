when Alex was first diagnosed the pump,0.0,6.629
was a popular way to go she utterly did,2.28,6.27
not feel comfortable doing that she,6.629,4.201
wanted to do injections I thought it was,8.55,4.11
important to follow her lead in all,10.83,4.62
things because it was helping her to,12.66,4.949
become independent living with type 1,15.45,4.19
diabetes,17.609,2.031
so what ended up happening was she was,25.57,7.72
using the injections pretty much every,29.9,5.61
day and there was a lot of ups and downs,33.29,5.01
there were a lot of things we couldn't,35.51,7.74
figure out and it just became very clear,38.3,8.91
that the management of the diabetes was,43.25,6.54
going to be much better handled if she,47.21,6.24
went on a pump and I think initially as,49.79,6.269
a young woman she felt that having,53.45,5.94
anything attached to her body was not,56.059,5.041
something that she really wanted to do,59.39,4.83
and I understood that she did the,61.1,5.73
injections for about a year and then she,64.22,6.18
went on the pump and it is remarkable,66.83,6.899
the difference in how the pump is able,70.4,7.68
to manage diabetes better than in our,73.729,8.311
opinion in our experience injections,78.08,6.149
because it's a lot more work with the,82.04,5.82
injections so we kind of took baby steps,84.229,6.871
towards it but at the end of the day and,87.86,5.34
the technology has changed greatly as,91.1,6.15
well the pump is very tiny now and it,93.2,6.9
just becomes normal to wear but in the,97.25,5.22
beginning it can be a transition the,100.1,4.35
second thing that was incredibly helpful,102.47,6.0
was CGM which again alex refused to do,104.45,6.779
for a while and she was finger pricking,108.47,6.539
and that became somewhat untenable,111.229,7.2
because you have to prick your finger so,115.009,5.67
many times during the day and you know,118.429,4.14
what sometimes you don't because you,120.679,3.811
don't feel like doing it but with the,122.569,5.731
CGM it's automatic and it gives you all,124.49,5.879
the information and it feeds you,128.3,5.549
everything so I would say in our,130.369,6.871
experience that using the pump and the,133.849,4.851
CGM technology,137.24,4.7
was life-altering but what I would also,138.7,6.93
say is that as a newly diagnosed family,141.94,6.6
sometimes you need to go through what,145.63,5.76
you need to go through in terms of the,148.54,5.19
initial injections and that's okay,151.39,4.13
that's okay,153.73,4.28
