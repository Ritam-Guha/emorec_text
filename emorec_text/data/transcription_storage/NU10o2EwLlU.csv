when I was diagnosed with diabetes I was,0.0,8.46
dumbfounded I was 200 pounds at 57 but I,3.449,7.77
wasn't physically working out or doing,8.46,5.28
anything in particular and I attended,11.219,5.221
piedmont diabetes clinic and learned how,13.74,6.0
to properly eat and take care of myself,16.44,6.419
I came home I went through all of my,19.74,5.16
cabinets a my refrigerator and threw,22.859,4.621
everything out and I decided I'm going,24.9,4.59
to get rid of this I'm going to turn,27.48,5.759
this around in six months and that was,29.49,6.78
my goal I was concerned about what,33.239,5.671
diabetes would do to my body once i,36.27,6.03
received a diagnosis and i did not want,38.91,5.79
to have to deal with any of that so I,42.3,4.98
did additional research and found out,44.7,5.15
you know people have had amputations,47.28,5.939
they've gone blind they've had other,49.85,6.91
health issues pancreas issues they've,53.219,8.16
had liver issues kidney issues and I was,56.76,6.63
determined not to have to go through,61.379,4.381
that one of the things that is most,63.39,4.86
beneficial for people with diabetes is,65.76,5.49
to take into consideration our ancestors,68.25,5.28
what they did and they were basically,71.25,6.45
hunters and gatherers and so I said okay,73.53,8.19
let's berries fruits vegetables that was,77.7,8.43
just common sense logical to me so I,81.72,6.6
went to the farmers market and went,86.13,5.309
shopping so I was kind of surprised my,88.32,5.009
grocery bills went down from about one,91.439,3.601
hundred and twenty dollars a week down,93.329,5.281
to forty dollars a week and I was so,95.04,5.039
impressed with that that was a,98.61,5.46
motivating factor to change my diet I,100.079,7.82
had set a goal for myself to reverse my,104.07,6.42
diagnosis within a six-month period and,107.899,5.68
I was so determined I'm I managed to,110.49,5.6
accomplish that within three months and,113.579,5.4
to alleviate my life of the additional,116.09,4.42
stress of having,118.979,4.381
iBD's with paramount to me in order to,120.51,6.38
get my life back on track,123.36,3.53
you,131.11,2.06
