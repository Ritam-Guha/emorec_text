all the energy on our planet earth,0.799,5.681
comes from the sun but we humans much,3.439,4.4
like every other animal,6.48,3.68
are not able to directly harvest the,7.839,4.241
energy that comes from the sun,10.16,4.32
plants do this work for us in their,12.08,4.8
leaves plants contain a green pigment,14.48,2.799
called,16.88,3.12
chlorophyll that enables them to use the,17.279,4.241
energy from the sun,20.0,4.48
to combine water and carbon dioxide and,21.52,4.48
turn them into oxygen,24.48,4.16
and the sugar glucose this process is,26.0,3.119
called,28.64,3.28
photosynthesis glucose is the most,29.119,3.921
abundant sugar,31.92,3.44
in nature and it stores the energy,33.04,3.44
coming from the sun,35.36,3.039
in a form that can then be used by,36.48,3.919
plants and animals as well,38.399,4.401
glucose can also be further processed to,40.399,3.601
other more complex,42.8,3.68
carbohydrates such as starch for longer,44.0,3.84
term energy storage,46.48,3.36
or even transform to other nutrients,47.84,3.039
such as lipids,49.84,3.52
amino acids or vitamins sometimes,50.879,4.0
incorporating minerals,53.36,4.0
that are found in the soil by eating,54.879,3.121
plants,57.36,3.28
or animals who previously ate plants we,58.0,4.8
can get these molecules and use them to,60.64,2.8
sustain,62.8,3.2
our own life without plants on this,63.44,3.2
planet,66.0,3.439
we would not be able to survive we would,66.64,5.04
still have plenty of energy coming from,69.439,2.961
the sun,71.68,3.2
but no way of using it it would be like,72.4,4.719
being thirsty in the middle of the ocean,74.88,5.04
surrounded by water but water we cannot,77.119,3.761
drink,79.92,3.28
carbohydrates are at the basis of human,80.88,4.4
diet the word all over,83.2,5.68
rice pasta bread potatoes cassava banana,85.28,6.0
corn are staple foods for billions of,88.88,3.04
people,91.28,2.64
and are primarily sources of,91.92,3.36
carbohydrates,93.92,4.559
carbohydrate means hydrated carbon and,95.28,5.28
that's what the plants do when they,98.479,4.32
combine water and carbon dioxide,100.56,5.199
to make glucose they split water into,102.799,4.481
oxygen and hydrogen,105.759,4.0
and add these molecules to carbon,107.28,4.64
creating energy rich bonds,109.759,4.4
when these bonds will be broken down,111.92,4.559
they will be able to release the energy,114.159,3.6
that they store,116.479,3.121
this process which is cellular,117.759,3.201
respiration,119.6,3.0
is basically the opposite of,120.96,3.92
photosynthesis and is what happens,122.6,3.799
inside all of our cells,124.88,4.48
to extract energy from nutrients this,126.399,3.601
molecule,129.36,3.599
is glucose also called dextrose it,130.0,3.599
contains,132.959,3.841
six atoms of carbons bound to each other,133.599,6.161
and two atoms of hydrogen and oxygen the,136.8,5.36
primary function of glucose is of course,139.76,3.68
an energetic one,142.16,4.159
it gives us 4 kilocalories per gram,143.44,5.6
glucose is not our only source of energy,146.319,4.721
we can also get energy from other,149.04,4.0
carbohydrates as well as fat,151.04,4.4
and proteins however glucose is the,153.04,4.72
easiest molecule to get energy from,155.44,4.96
it is readily available fuel for all of,157.76,3.839
our cells,160.4,4.0
it also has another big advantage in,161.599,4.881
emergency situations when our,164.4,4.64
oxygen supply is limited for example,166.48,4.8
during intense physical activity,169.04,5.04
we can extract some energy from glucose,171.28,4.48
even without oxygen,174.08,4.079
whereas for example we cannot burn any,175.76,4.64
fat without oxygen,178.159,4.881
for this reason while fat is our main,180.4,3.36
fuel at,183.04,3.6
rest and during light activity glucose,183.76,4.399
becomes our main fuel,186.64,4.08
during intense physical activity when,188.159,4.72
blood and oxygen supply to our muscle,190.72,2.72
cells,192.879,3.601
become scarce but this doesn't mean that,193.44,5.2
we don't need glucose for energy even,196.48,3.92
when we are at rest,198.64,3.84
glucose is always necessary to,200.4,3.36
completely burn,202.48,4.319
fats for energy without the intermediate,203.76,5.039
molecules that derive from glucose,206.799,2.961
breakdown,208.799,3.681
fats can only be broken down partially,209.76,4.24
and release their energy,212.48,4.72
incompletely like biochemists like to,214.0,3.92
say,217.2,3.759
fat burns on the flame of carbs,217.92,5.44
on top of that there are some tissues in,220.959,3.121
our body,223.36,2.72
that can get their energy only from,224.08,4.239
glucose these include our brain,226.08,4.4
our nervous system in general and our,228.319,3.441
red blood cells,230.48,3.839
for all these reasons we must have a,231.76,4.64
certain amount of glucose circulating in,234.319,3.2
our bloodstream,236.4,4.24
at all times and as we will soon learn,237.519,5.601
our body goes to extreme lengths to,240.64,4.879
ensure that a constant supply of glucose,243.12,4.96
is always maintained for example in,245.519,4.961
emergency situations when blood glucose,248.08,4.4
levels start to dangerously drop,250.48,4.64
our body can build its own glucose,252.48,4.24
starting from proteins,255.12,3.76
but this is a waste because proteins are,256.72,3.039
normally used,258.88,2.96
for more important structural and,259.759,3.761
regulatory functions,261.84,4.32
besides since our body doesn't store,263.52,3.84
extra protein,266.16,3.52
we may need to steal these proteins from,267.36,3.44
our lean mass,269.68,4.079
for example our muscles so this,270.8,3.839
indirectly,273.759,3.681
is another important function of glucose,274.639,3.761
it spares,277.44,3.039
precious proteins from being used as,278.4,4.4
sources of glucose and energy,280.479,4.241
another important function of blood,282.8,3.52
glucose is to signal,284.72,4.64
hunger and satiety you already know that,286.32,5.92
high or raising blood glucose signals at,289.36,4.48
its time to stop eating,292.24,4.08
while the law or dropping blood glucose,293.84,3.76
signals that it's time,296.32,3.84
to eat again so to recap these are the,297.6,5.36
main functions of glucose in our body,300.16,5.28
it provides readily available energy for,302.96,4.4
our body at rest and during life,305.44,2.88
activity,307.36,3.2
it is the only source of energy during,308.32,4.879
intense anaerobic physical activity,310.56,5.12
it provides energy for our brain nervous,313.199,5.121
system and red blood cells at all times,315.68,4.88
it allows an efficient utilization of,318.32,3.68
fats for energy,320.56,3.84
it spares proteins from use a source of,322.0,4.08
energy and blood glucose,324.4,4.0
and its blood variations signal hunger,326.08,3.92
and satiety,328.4,4.16
glucose and other sugars also play more,330.0,4.96
fine-tuned structural and regulatory,332.56,4.079
functions in our body,334.96,4.079
for example they are often used as tags,336.639,3.441
for molecules,339.039,3.361
to traffic them inside our cells or,340.08,4.559
indicate their destination,342.4,4.88
they are also part of complex structures,344.639,4.881
on the surface of our cell membranes,347.28,4.96
that play a role in signaling cell cell,349.52,3.6
communication,352.24,3.959
recognition and immunity cell surface,353.12,5.359
glycosaminoglycans protect and lubricate,356.199,3.241
our joints,358.479,3.681
and most of our tissues a particular,359.44,3.44
sugar,362.16,3.52
ribose is a key structural component of,362.88,4.159
our dna,365.68,3.519
all these advanced functions of sugars,367.039,4.561
however are not strictly relevant from a,369.199,3.84
nutritional point of view,371.6,3.68
because nutritionally sugars are,373.039,3.921
non-essential,375.28,4.08
this means that our body can easily,376.96,3.92
interconvert sugars,379.36,4.24
into one another or build them starting,380.88,4.08
from other molecules,383.6,3.039
so whenever it needs to build a,384.96,3.84
particular sugar containing molecule,386.639,4.4
it can easily build the sugar components,388.8,4.399
it needs without having to get them,391.039,3.041
directly from,393.199,3.761
food this is not possible for example,394.08,5.36
for many amino acids involved in protein,396.96,3.28
synthesis,399.44,7.599
as well as some lipids,400.24,6.799
