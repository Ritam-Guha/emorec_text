now's a great opportunity for you to,5.52,3.119
take a look at this disease,7.2,3.2
as something you can live with how it,8.639,3.201
can actually make you healthier because,10.4,2.8
you're going to have a different focus,11.84,3.12
on diet and exercise now,13.2,4.24
to me i really talk about how diabetes,14.96,4.079
can really be the opportunity for you to,17.44,3.04
get healthier,19.039,4.08
for me being diagnosed with diabetes it,20.48,3.12
drawn,23.119,3.601
it drew me more to what can i do how can,23.6,4.72
i have a healthier diet,26.72,3.52
eat more fruits and vegetables drink,28.32,3.039
more water,30.24,3.12
it helps me to remember my focus on,31.359,4.081
exercise because exercise burns blood,33.36,2.8
sugar,35.44,3.68
get out be active if you've never had an,36.16,4.559
exercise routine before,39.12,3.84
now's a great time to start go ahead and,40.719,3.921
take the walk around the block,42.96,4.079
go for a walk over your lunch hour if,44.64,4.079
you really want to join a gym and do,47.039,2.321
that,48.719,3.201
do that find something you enjoy the,49.36,3.519
best thing you're going to do for,51.92,1.76
yourself,52.879,2.401
is to be active in something that you,53.68,3.359
enjoy doing,55.28,4.48
if you're someone that only drinks soda,57.039,4.081
stop drinking soda,59.76,4.16
stop drinking juices stop drinking sugar,61.12,3.84
sweetened drinks,63.92,2.96
start drinking more water the next thing,64.96,3.199
i would encourage you to do is to,66.88,2.559
schedule an appointment with one of the,68.159,2.241
educators,69.439,3.441
we can help put this all in perspective,70.4,4.16
it's really hard when you're going on,72.88,3.2
websites and you're looking around and,74.56,2.96
you're getting information,76.08,3.359
from your aunt or your uncle or your,77.52,3.52
neighbor and everyone's telling you the,79.439,3.281
bad stuff and the good stuff,81.04,4.48
what you can and can't do find a trained,82.72,3.28
educator,85.52,2.16
that's going to be able to put that,86.0,3.68
together for you in your life,87.68,3.52
we can make this something you can live,89.68,3.68
with,91.2,2.16
many people diagnosed with diabetes ask,96.799,4.801
why should i test my blood sugar,98.88,4.879
to me i don't think i really know how i,101.6,3.92
feel unless i've tested i look at,103.759,2.881
testing,105.52,3.04
as kind of your speedometer you don't,106.64,3.68
really know how fast or slow you're,108.56,3.199
going unless you're actually looking,110.32,1.92
down,111.759,2.081
you can be driving in traffic and,112.24,2.879
believe that you're going the speed,113.84,1.84
limit,115.119,2.0
but actually when you look down you,115.68,3.6
recognize that maybe you're 10 15 even,117.119,3.921
20 miles an hour over,119.28,3.6
you felt fine because everyone else was,121.04,3.359
driving that speed limit,122.88,2.96
the same can be said for your blood,124.399,3.601
sugar we get used to how we feel,125.84,4.72
on a day-to-day basis if we don't test,128.0,3.68
our blood sugar,130.56,3.039
we may not even recognize that our,131.68,3.6
numbers are higher or lower than they're,133.599,2.801
supposed to be,135.28,3.28
testing is a great way to keep yourself,136.4,4.24
honest as well as to give you the great,138.56,3.759
information when you're succeeding at,140.64,2.72
what you're doing,142.319,2.64
that your exercise and your diet are,143.36,4.56
really paying off,144.959,2.961
for most people with diabetes testing,151.519,4.161
once a day is all you need to do,153.36,5.04
find the best time of day for you for us,155.68,3.68
as providers,158.4,3.119
we like to see a variety of tests how,159.36,3.84
you sit first thing in the morning,161.519,3.281
and how maybe your blood sugars are one,163.2,3.44
to two hours after a meal,164.8,3.76
however if you feel like you can't get,166.64,3.04
that done,168.56,3.039
at least get once a day testing when it,169.68,4.0
fits in your life this is a disease you,171.599,3.041
will have,173.68,2.8
for the rest of your life so we want,174.64,3.2
this to be something you can feel,176.48,9.36
successful in,177.84,8.0
