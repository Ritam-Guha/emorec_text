hold on to your seats because today in,0.829,4.111
the recovery room we're talking,3.03,4.59
cellulitis a type of infection that,4.94,4.36
people who have had lymph nodes removed,7.62,3.899
from their underarms or their groin are,9.3,4.919
more at risk of getting now I know it's,11.519,4.831
not exciting I know it's not fun but it,14.219,3.81
is a really important topic and I'd,16.35,3.36
rather you learn it here in the recovery,18.029,4.021
room then in urgent care,19.71,4.44
hi I'm cancer physical therapy,22.05,4.44
specialist dr. Leslie walki welcome to,24.15,4.459
the recovery room today we're talking,26.49,6.24
cellulitis what it is why it can be such,28.609,6.371
a big deal how you can minimize your,32.73,5.04
risk of getting it and what to do if you,34.98,8.28
do get it let's break it down cellulitis,37.77,7.8
is a bacterial infection that occurs,43.26,6.029
right underneath the skin it is most,45.57,5.879
common in people who've had lymph nodes,49.289,4.351
removed either from their underarms or,51.449,4.831
their groin because one of the jobs of,53.64,4.59
those lymph nodes is to remove and,56.28,4.02
destroy that bacteria so if you have,58.23,4.14
fewer lymph nodes to protect your arm or,60.3,3.84
your leg you are a little bit higher,62.37,4.38
risk of getting a cellulitis type,64.14,5.85
infection now obviously the area that,66.75,4.619
you are at risk for cellulitis will,69.99,3.6
correspond to where you had your lymph,71.369,4.381
nodes removed so if you have lymph nodes,73.59,4.68
removed from your right X Allah your,75.75,4.29
right arm is at risk if you have lymph,78.27,3.63
nodes removed from your left groin it is,80.04,5.67
your left leg that is at risk cellulitis,81.9,7.59
will typically most often present itself,85.71,8.25
as redness in that arm or that leg it,89.49,7.07
can also be associated with tenderness,93.96,8.21
warmth and increased swelling or edema,96.56,8.949
most common symptom will be redness so,102.17,5.739
if you see redness and don't feel any,105.509,5.281
heat or tenderness or swelling I still,107.909,4.861
want you to call your physician or nurse,110.79,5.759
right away anyway cellulitis can be a,112.77,5.489
big deal for a couple of reasons number,116.549,5.28
one if left untreated it can spread to,118.259,5.82
your lymph nodes and your blood stream,121.829,4.08
and can potentially make you pretty sick,124.079,4.921
especially if you are elderly have a lot,125.909,5.55
of other health problems or have just,129.0,4.62
had chemotherapy and you are immune,131.459,4.2
first chances are if you're in one of,133.62,3.66
those situations you're going to let end,135.659,4.47
up in the hospital on IV antibiotics to,137.28,6.349
treat that cellulitis secondly,140.129,6.271
cellulitis in your involved arm or leg,143.629,5.08
is also one of the biggest precipitators,146.4,5.759
of causing lymphedema and sometimes,148.709,4.92
those lymphedema go away when the,152.159,3.481
infection goes away but sometimes they,153.629,4.11
can be permanent so again if you see,155.64,4.53
redness or feel warmth or tenderness or,157.739,4.231
see swelling we want you to call your,160.17,3.959
physician or nurse practitioner and get,161.97,4.98
on an oral antibiotic right away now,164.129,5.131
again because the body does not regrow,166.95,4.98
lymph nodes your risk for cellulitis is,169.26,5.67
technically lifelong some people however,171.93,5.16
will go an entire lifetime without ever,174.93,3.69
getting a cellulitis in their armor,177.09,2.88
their leg where other people,178.62,3.39
unfortunately seem to get them all the,179.97,3.51
time even they live even though they,182.01,5.19
follow all the right rules the best way,183.48,5.819
to minimize your risk of getting a,187.2,4.59
cellulitis is to protect your skin,189.299,5.731
protect it from scrapes scratches burns,191.79,6.9
punctures or bites now that doesn't mean,195.03,5.25
that you stop doing the things that you,198.69,2.01
enjoy,200.28,3.179
I still want you gardening and playing,200.7,5.039
golf and out hiking and doing all that,203.459,4.56
stuff just protect your skin while you,205.739,4.771
are doing those activities if by some,208.019,4.83
chance you do scrape scratched burn or,210.51,3.869
puncturing your puncture your arm or leg,212.849,3.211
in some way you're going to keep that,214.379,3.42
area clean you're going to keep an eye,216.06,3.299
on it and if it doesn't look like it's,217.799,3.241
healing normally you're gonna give your,219.359,5.791
doctor or nurse a call now I do want to,221.04,5.819
point out that when you get needle,225.15,3.989
punctures or IVs in a doctor's office or,226.859,4.59
in the hospital those are sterile and,229.139,5.671
those are absolutely okay and safe to,231.449,6.18
review cellulitis is a bacterial,234.81,5.13
infection right underneath the skin that,237.629,3.661
people that have had lymph nodes removed,239.94,4.29
are more at risk of getting we want to,241.29,5.009
jump on it really quickly if you do see,244.23,4.68
redness warmth or tenderness or swelling,246.299,4.711
because we don't want it to lead to a,248.91,4.259
bigger infection or precipitate a,251.01,3.78
lymphedema so you're going to give your,253.169,4.021
physician or nurse a call right away,254.79,6.33
it's that simple and that important,257.19,6.45
I'm dr. Leslie walki thank you for,261.12,4.26
spending time in the recovery room we,263.64,4.88
will talk again soon,265.38,3.14
