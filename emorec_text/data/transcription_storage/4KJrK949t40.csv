in this video I'm going to talk about,0.03,3.81
the other reasons why your blood sugar,1.29,5.04
might be high you know other than you,3.84,5.25
consuming carbohydrates as you might,6.33,5.25
know when you consume carbs your blood,9.09,5.37
sugar will go higher okay so I think,11.58,4.89
most people know that and if you want to,14.46,3.81
reduce it you need to reduce your carbs,16.47,3.84
and that should normally bring it down,18.27,5.49
however what if it goes up especially in,20.31,5.969
the morning what could it be well at,23.76,6.63
about 8 o'clock in the morning you have,26.279,6.511
this hormone shift okay you have this,30.39,4.62
spike of this hormone called cortisol,32.79,5.519
that's the stress hormone that will,35.01,8.069
mobilize sugar from the body and spike,38.309,7.651
blood sugars so it's coming from,43.079,4.921
cortisol especially if there's an,45.96,4.2
adrenal problem and there's insulin,48.0,5.039
resistance number two you have low blood,50.16,5.46
sugar for some reason it's hypoglycemia,53.039,6.601
and you have these counter regulatory,55.62,7.23
hormones including cortisol as one of,59.64,4.89
them okay so but this is for a different,62.85,1.98
reason,64.53,2.73
this could happen anywhere during the,64.83,4.859
day okay we're not talking about right,67.26,3.87
after a meal we're talking about when,69.689,3.211
you're not eating you have these three,71.13,3.21
hormones cortisol glucagon and,72.9,3.99
adrenaline that kicks in if your blood,74.34,5.099
sugars get too low and that can raise,76.89,4.229
your blood Sugar's so the reason you,79.439,3.781
have hypoglycemia in the first place is,81.119,4.89
you're somehow doing something to spike,83.22,4.829
insulin and it's pushing this blood,86.009,3.811
sugar down and it could be because,88.049,3.151
you're eating when you're eating you're,89.82,3.36
eating a lot of carbs okay that could be,91.2,4.02
one reason or you are eating too,93.18,4.259
frequently so then we have the counter,95.22,4.35
hormones coming in to try to push up the,97.439,4.441
blood sugar and sometimes it could bring,99.57,3.869
it up too high so that's another reason,101.88,3.93
right there number three you had a snack,103.439,4.5
late last night and it was a,105.81,4.53
carbohydrate snack and what's happening,107.939,4.351
is that you're seeing the effects of the,110.34,5.639
blood sugar the next day and before you,112.29,5.579
ate sugar the day before and that will,115.979,3.57
throw off the blood sugars now if you,117.869,3.091
having a problem today with your blood,119.549,3.691
sugars chances are the real cause of it,120.96,4.589
was in the previous day where you ate,123.24,4.14
some carb I mean people don't look at,125.549,3.3
that they're focused right on what they,127.38,2.519
ate like an hour ago,128.849,2.821
however these blood sugar issues could,129.899,3.721
actually be originating from,131.67,4.14
something you did 24 hours ago alright,133.62,4.92
number five low blood pressure let's say,135.81,4.05
you're taking a lot of blood pressure,138.54,3.33
medication where your blood pressure is,139.86,4.519
too low guess what that will activate,141.87,5.31
cortisol to bring it back up and,144.379,6.121
actually raise your blood glucose levels,147.18,6.33
all right number six you going through,150.5,5.62
some type of stress that can raise your,153.51,5.67
glucose level or you had trauma or you,156.12,5.039
had an infection or you're taking,159.18,4.77
cortisol synthetically like medication,161.159,4.55
like you're taking prednisone or,163.95,5.64
cortisol injections for some reason that,165.709,6.28
could do it right there number seven you,169.59,4.32
forgot to take your medications if,171.989,3.87
you're diabetic and you've forgot to,173.91,4.59
take your insulin or whatever last night,175.859,4.681
there's nothing there to push the blood,178.5,5.459
sugar down so it's high today all right,180.54,5.58
number eight you exercise the night,183.959,4.321
before and that burned up all your sugar,186.12,4.679
now guess what happens right here your,188.28,4.62
body has these counter hormones that are,190.799,4.261
gonna kick in and start raising your,192.9,5.07
blood sugars and number nine you had,195.06,5.039
hidden MSG in the diet,197.97,4.56
monosodium glutamate which will increase,200.099,5.82
blood sugars or you had artificial,202.53,5.639
sweeteners which will also increase,205.919,4.891
your blood Sugar's the ultimate solution,208.169,5.451
for this is just to do healthy keto and,210.81,5.579
intermittent fasting and do it long,213.62,5.29
enough for your body to correct the,216.389,4.921
