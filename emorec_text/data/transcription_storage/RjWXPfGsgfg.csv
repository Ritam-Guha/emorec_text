so I know that you probably found this,0.03,2.94
video because you're looking for an,1.5,3.569
alternative to that nasty Glu Cola that,2.97,3.69
you're gonna drink for you that glucose,5.069,2.701
tolerance test,6.66,3.0
hey hey mama is it's your midwife Kyra,7.77,3.93
here I want to give you a truly natural,9.66,4.47
perspective on that glucose tolerance,11.7,4.95
test if truly natural is something that,14.13,3.899
you're interested in you're gonna want,16.65,2.19
to go ahead and click the subscribe,18.029,2.881
button to get update every Midwife,18.84,4.17
Monday but for today let's talk a little,20.91,4.65
bit about the glucose tolerance test so,23.01,3.75
this looks actually a really common,25.56,2.91
topic I've been watching it spread all,26.76,3.39
over the internet for the last couple of,28.47,3.78
years that mom is just like you are,30.15,4.319
looking for alternatives to that nasty,32.25,3.96
Glu Cola because of all of its harsh,34.469,2.551
chemicals,36.21,3.15
it's nasty ingredients it's really,37.02,4.109
starting to get a bad rap among the,39.36,4.289
natural community traditionally since,41.129,4.291
I've been trained at least midwives have,43.649,3.691
offered an alternative to the Glu Cola,45.42,4.709
txt and still getting the same glucose,47.34,4.8
tolerance test results that are really,50.129,3.601
important to the optimal health of your,52.14,4.11
pregnancy so if you're wondering if the,53.73,4.53
test is important the answer is yes,56.25,4.949
so around 28 weeks of pregnancy your,58.26,4.529
physician or Midwife is gonna be,61.199,3.24
offering you a glucose tolerance test,62.789,3.841
and let me start by saying this test is,64.439,3.811
actually really important,66.63,4.5
diabetes is rampant in the United States,68.25,5.7
but particularly during pregnancy it is,71.13,4.19
actually a pretty common problem,73.95,3.51
particularly in Louisiana where I,75.32,5.08
practice because of the diets that we,77.46,6.99
have and so the glucose tolerance test,80.4,5.969
really is an important test because it,84.45,3.959
lets us know if you have gestational,86.369,4.68
diabetes diagnosing gestational diabetes,88.409,4.741
during pregnancy is really important to,91.049,3.481
the health of your baby and yourself,93.15,4.109
during your pregnancy however we don't,94.53,4.74
have to take such harsh means to make it,97.259,4.261
happen so with that said the Glu Cola,99.27,4.379
that is typically offered in a,101.52,5.01
traditional lab setting is just full of,103.649,3.93
harsh chemicals,106.53,3.69
I mean it's 50 grams of sugar as it is,107.579,4.68
but adding the harsh chemicals and some,110.22,3.539
of the other ingredients in the,112.259,3.631
ingredients list it's not exactly the,113.759,3.36
best thing to be putting in your body,115.89,2.339
when you're pregnant,117.119,3.511
in fact my opposition to the,118.229,4.021
cause tolerance test with the glue Cola,120.63,4.5
is that it's kind of equivalent to,122.25,6.149
fasting and then drinking a coke and,125.13,6.06
eating a Snickers bar like most pregnant,128.399,4.771
women do not do that to their bodies,131.19,4.92
especially my practice haha they'd be,133.17,6.149
kicked out so an alternative to the,136.11,5.4
glucose tolerance test that I prefer is,139.319,4.291
called the pancake breakfast if you have,141.51,3.72
heard of other alternatives that you'd,143.61,3.209
like to share put it in the comments,145.23,4.289
below this is the pancake breakfast that,146.819,4.92
I offer my clients here at the natural,149.519,4.591
birth house so it's the same amount of,151.739,4.651
sugar which is 50 grams of sugar but,154.11,4.68
it's been a much more natural package,156.39,4.86
per se two pancakes with butter and,158.79,5.64
syrup eggs two eggs and a glass of juice,161.25,5.489
will bring us up to 50 grams of sugar,164.43,5.58
along with carbohydrates healthy fats,166.739,7.5
and real food that's so important real,170.01,7.83
food and so my mom is will eat this two,174.239,4.951
hours before they come in for their,177.84,3.03
appointment and they'll come and get,179.19,4.109
their fingers stuck in my office to give,180.87,4.26
their glucose tolerance test results,183.299,4.141
it's called a two-hour postprandial test,185.13,4.8
and this is the way I test my mama's on,187.44,4.379
their glucose levels and in fact there's,189.93,3.48
a doctor here in town who has adopted,191.819,4.381
this idea and his practice as well so,193.41,4.29
what are the benefits of the glue Cola,196.2,4.08
the glue Cola is really beneficial for,197.7,4.95
moms who want a super tight schedule who,200.28,4.5
really need to come in drink their drink,202.65,4.02
they have one hour and they need to get,204.78,4.62
out but the pancake breakfast although,206.67,4.71
it is a two-hour test it's based on real,209.4,4.649
food there are other alternatives to the,211.38,4.74
pancake breakfast even there's the jelly,214.049,5.131
bean test there is orange juice test and,216.12,5.31
if you really just don't want to take in,219.18,4.95
50 grams of sugar in a sitting then you,221.43,5.61
can always offer your Midwife or your,224.13,4.74
physician to do two weeks of home,227.04,3.63
monitoring of your glucose levels at,228.87,3.63
home based on your normal diet I know,230.67,3.96
that there are many many mamas out there,232.5,3.72
who've taken that test and either,234.63,4.469
vomited or passed out in fact one of my,236.22,4.379
friends took the glucose tolerance test,239.099,4.411
with the glue Cola passed out bail on,240.599,4.771
her pregnant belly was hospitalized for,243.51,5.189
three days and she actually passed her,245.37,5.9
glucose check so this,248.699,4.911
in my opinion this test is the most,251.27,5.939
reliable way or the most convenient way,253.61,6.66
to get those results so anyway if you,257.209,4.861
would like to leave us some comments,260.27,4.05
below about your experience either with,262.07,3.36
the pancake breakfast,264.32,2.97
or the glucose tolerance test or maybe,265.43,3.33
you have some other suggestions your,267.29,3.0
