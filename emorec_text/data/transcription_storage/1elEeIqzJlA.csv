hba1c is a blood test that shows how,0.0,4.17
well you are controlling your blood,2.73,4.23
sugar over time it does this by taking a,4.17,4.71
look at how much sugar is attached to,6.96,4.44
your red blood cells the more sugar that,8.88,5.4
is attached the higher your hba1c in,11.4,5.82
this video we'll take a look at how this,14.28,5.43
test works and ways to keep your results,17.22,7.559
in the healthy range hba1c goes by,19.71,7.26
different names so you might hear it,24.779,5.971
referred to as simply the a1c test the,26.97,6.99
hemoglobin a1c test or the glycated,30.75,6.12
hemoglobin test and while this last name,33.96,5.04
is the most complex it does the best job,36.87,4.38
of explaining what the test measures,39.0,5.16
which is the amount of sugar or glucose,41.25,5.489
that is sticking to a specific protein,44.16,4.079
in your red blood cells called,46.739,4.59
hemoglobin the process of glucose,48.239,5.131
binding to hemoglobin is called,51.329,4.681
glycation hence the name the glycated,53.37,5.91
hemoglobin test your red blood cells are,56.01,5.4
great targets for this test because of,59.28,4.29
their unique structure and how they use,61.41,5.1
glucose to survive red blood cells are,63.57,5.159
plentiful in your bloodstream and their,66.51,4.35
primary job is to carry oxygen around,68.729,4.801
your body and they take their job very,70.86,5.7
seriously so we see that as red blood,73.53,5.699
cells mature they fill up with more and,76.56,4.949
more hemoglobin which is the protein,79.229,4.89
that actually carries the oxygen but,81.509,4.68
this accumulation of hemoglobin makes,84.119,4.86
things very cramped inside the cells so,86.189,4.86
to make room mature red blood cells,88.979,4.231
sacrifice their mitochondria,91.049,4.771
mitochondria are the powerhouses that,93.21,4.53
the majority of your cells rely on to,95.82,4.53
make energy without these powerhouses,97.74,4.83
your red blood cells must get their,100.35,4.229
energy through a much less efficient,102.57,4.2
process that involves the fermentation,104.579,6.241
of glucose and while this process works,106.77,7.32
it wears the cells out quickly so the,110.82,5.88
average lifespan of a red blood cell is,114.09,5.04
relatively short and typically only a,116.7,5.34
few months in length during that short,119.13,5.43
life your red blood cells provide a,122.04,4.679
record of how much glucose they,124.56,4.83
encounter which acts as a good indicator,126.719,4.891
of how well you've been controlling your,129.39,3.97
blood sugar over time,131.61,4.27
and this ability to reveal a picture of,133.36,4.56
your average blood sugar over a few,135.88,5.43
months is what makes the hba1c test,137.92,5.04
useful as a screening test for,141.31,3.92
pre-diabetes and diabetes,142.96,4.74
now having red blood cells that are,145.23,4.99
essentially sugar-coated may sound a bit,147.7,5.01
alarming but it's normal to have some,150.22,6.06
glycation present so your hba1c would,152.71,7.17
never be 0 according to the National,156.28,6.03
Institute for Health a person without,159.88,5.72
diabetes would have an a1c level below,162.31,6.36
5.7 percent whereas a person with,165.6,6.609
diabetes would have an a1c of 6.5 or,168.67,6.539
above and in between these two figures a,172.209,5.551
person would be classified as having,175.209,6.091
pre-diabetes so you can see that keeping,177.76,6.38
your hba1c low is a desirable goal,181.3,4.83
unfortunately there are a number of,184.14,4.12
actions that you can take to naturally,186.13,5.01
lower your results the best approach is,188.26,5.13
to reduce the amount of quick digesting,191.14,4.83
carbohydrates that you're eating when,193.39,5.159
you eat carbohydrates your digestive,195.97,4.739
tract breaks them down into glucose,198.549,3.931
which is then transported into your,200.709,3.721
blood where the simple sugar comes in,202.48,4.319
contact with your red blood cells so you,204.43,4.86
want to eat in a way that minimizes,206.799,5.011
the rush of sugar into your blood and,209.29,5.82
that is done by reducing carbs that,211.81,6.39
break down quickly like sugar and,215.11,5.64
refined carbs which I refer to as the,218.2,5.849
three C's cookies cakes and candies some,220.75,5.25
carbohydrates like leafy greens non,224.049,3.841
starchy vegetables nuts and seeds,226.0,4.5
contain fiber and nutrients that slow,227.89,4.92
their breakdown and absorption so you,230.5,4.38
don't need to eliminate all carbs from,232.81,5.209
your diet just make different choices,234.88,6.3
exercise is also beneficial because it,238.019,5.171
helps your body use the sugar that is,241.18,3.809
available by improving insulin,243.19,4.32
sensitivity when your cells are more,244.989,4.831
insulin sensitive they have an easier,247.51,4.74
time pulling sugar out of your blood so,249.82,5.13
there is less circulating and the,252.25,4.799
exercise does not have to be exhausting,254.95,4.74
to be helpful even short brisk walks,257.049,5.161
after dinner can move you into a,259.69,5.64
positive direction these lifestyle,262.21,4.69
changes when done consist,265.33,3.49
can result in weight loss which is,266.9,3.78
another way you can bring down your,268.82,5.58
hba1c naturally in fact the effects of,270.68,5.34
weight loss can be dramatic,274.4,4.53
this study followed 522 middle-aged,276.02,5.28
overweight men and women for more than,278.93,4.44
three years during the study the,281.3,4.29
subjects were split into an intervention,283.37,4.44
group that was given help losing weight,285.59,5.28
and a control group due to the lifestyle,287.81,5.37
changes that resulted in weight loss the,290.87,4.56
risk of diabetes was reduced by 58,293.18,5.459
percent in the intervention group so,295.43,5.43
lifestyle choices will make a difference,298.639,5.461
in your hba1c level which is good news,300.86,5.66
because that means you have some control,304.1,5.28
however the changes will take time which,306.52,5.38
requires you to create a plan that is,309.38,5.34
easy to follow enjoyable and effective,311.9,5.61
