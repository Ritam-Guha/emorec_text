"- Hey everyone, this is
The 10's Beginner Workout.",8.879,1.91
"Basically, over the course of
the last four or five months",10.789,2.421
"I've had a lot of people ask
me for a beginners workout.",13.21,2.061
Basically a plan for someone,15.271,0.984
"who's never started working out,",16.255,1.527
"doesn't have a gym,
doesn't even have weights,",17.782,1.526
so just body weight stuff.,19.308,1.249
And this is great for people who,20.557,1.195
"either just wanna start
seeing their muscles increase,",21.752,2.357
"you know start getting like a
little bit of some definition",24.109,2.276
so you can get excited to go into the gym,26.385,1.991
or for people who need to lose some fat,28.376,1.846
cause you could do this as a cardio thing,30.222,1.823
and lose a lot of fat,32.045,1.079
"over the course of a couple
months doing this consistently.",33.124,3.025
"So, I'm going to take you into
the first exercise right now.",36.149,2.194
So the first exercise that we're gonna,38.343,1.207
start with is pushups.,39.55,0.952
"Now, if you have the ability to",40.502,1.417
you're gonna do full-form pushups.,41.919,1.846
But if you don't have the ability,43.765,1.114
to push yourself up 10 times,44.879,1.283
"then you're just going
to do it from your knees.",46.162,1.504
So instead of from your toes,47.666,1.213
you're doing it from your knees.,48.879,0.935
So it's 10 pushups.,49.814,0.946
All the way down.,50.76,1.66
"Make sure that you're
contracting your chest.",52.42,2.103
You're feeling your triceps engaged.,54.523,1.329
"I like to keep my elbows flared
in, not flared in, tucked in",55.852,3.216
"instead of keeping them
flared out like this.",59.068,4.009
About 10.,63.077,0.833
"I think that was eleven,
but we're about 10.",63.91,1.729
Then we're moving on to the next exercise.,65.639,1.539
"So the second exercise
we're going to do is",67.178,1.364
"really actually to get
your heart rate going",68.542,1.358
and it's going to be burpees.,69.9,1.149
"You know what these are, but
I'll show you them anyways.",71.049,1.73
"Basically start standing, come
down, push your legs back,",72.779,3.774
and come back up.,76.553,1.091
And because this is a 10's workout,77.644,2.008
of course we're doing ten of these.,79.652,2.119
(upbeat music),81.771,2.583
"Woohoo, now we're going
on to the third exercise.",86.756,2.543
"Alright, so now we're
doing a third exercise",89.299,1.544
"and this third exercise
is going to be focusing",90.843,1.741
on your leg muscles instead of cardio.,92.584,1.974
"So what we are going to
do is alternating lunges.",94.558,1.614
"Each time you come up
on both sides is one.",96.172,3.583
So you need to do ten of those.,100.973,1.236
"When you do these you
wanna to extend your foot",102.209,1.631
"as far as you can forward
and comfortably land on it.",103.84,2.363
Not hard like I just did.,106.203,1.312
"Land with your heel, come down,",107.515,1.608
push through your knee through your heel,109.123,2.014
as you come back up and push back.,111.137,2.589
"This should be sort of,
you should feel your quads,",113.726,3.123
your hamstrings and your glutes engaged,116.849,1.568
because you're pushing yourself back,118.417,1.468
"instead of when you're doing
a walking lunge forward.",119.885,3.302
So 10 of these.,123.187,1.15
(upbeat music),124.337,2.583
"And now we move on to the last
exercise of the 10's workout.",129.683,2.25
"Alright, so as you can see I'm already",131.933,1.111
starting to sweat a little bit,133.044,1.544
(buzz),134.588,0.833
"so this is pretty hard cardio for anyone,",135.421,1.21
"especially if you have
a little extra weight",136.631,1.318
to throw around.,137.949,0.833
"And, you like my model pose?",138.782,1.35
"This last exercise is
going to be for your abs.",140.132,2.507
"It's kinda a crunch but
it's like my own style.",142.639,1.794
So this is what we are going to do.,144.433,1.149
10 of these of course.,145.582,1.678
Lay down flat.,147.26,1.504
You're going to bring your knees up,148.764,0.833
as you bring your torso up.,149.597,1.058
So it's just like this.,150.655,1.457
"Your hands are extended
straight to keep your balance.",152.112,1.567
Just like that.,153.679,1.422
All the way up.,155.101,1.063
All the way down.,156.164,1.48
"Keeping your shoulder
blades off of the ground,",157.644,2.09
and your heels off the ground,159.734,1.196
so that you're abs are constantly engaged.,160.93,2.374
We're going to do ten of these.,163.304,1.788
(upbeat music),165.092,1.515
"Whew, okay, so I'm pretty
sweaty, I'm pretty worked up.",166.607,3.099
My heart beat's going pretty fast.,169.706,1.278
This is a great exercise really for anyone,170.984,1.909
"that's starting out,
really needs to get a base,",172.893,2.479
just start doing something.,175.372,1.858
This is great because you can recycle this,177.23,1.735
and you can do this as much as you want.,178.965,1.219
"Also, if you're ever on the
road and you can't do anything,",180.184,1.986
"you know you don't have
a gym that you can go to,",182.17,1.811
you can definitely do this.,183.981,1.329
"Just to do a little bit of
something, some maintenance work.",185.31,2.398
"So you just saw the four
exercises that we did",187.708,1.312
for 10 reps each.,189.02,1.074
Once you've done each of those one time,190.094,1.764
that is one interval.,191.858,1.457
"Basically, if you're just starting,",193.315,1.945
"you haven't done anything in
your life do one interval.",195.26,1.997
"But you know, kinda judge
how you feel you can handle,",197.257,2.455
"and then every time you
work out with this try to,",199.712,2.694
"try to do another interval
if you think you can.",202.406,2.055
"If you think you can handle
it do another interval,",204.461,1.643
"and work your way up until
you can do this you know",206.104,2.177
"15 times no problem,",208.281,1.166
"because by that point you
could walk into a gym,",209.447,2.235
and you know you could handle things.,211.682,1.73
You'd have a little bit of musculature.,213.412,1.237
"You'd know a little bit
more about your body.",214.649,2.037
"Plus, if you're someone
who is a little bit obese",216.686,2.136
"this is a great way to lose fat,",218.822,1.583
"kinda get some confidence in yourself,",220.405,1.541
"realize what you're doing,",221.946,1.01
"realize how to exercise and
then you can come to a gym,",222.956,2.514
and just be completely comfortable.,225.47,1.155
So there you go guys!,226.625,0.833
"You all asked me to
make a beginner workout.",227.458,1.391
"I know there are a lot
of people that follow me",228.849,1.254
that aren't even into fitness you know,230.103,1.526
