hello there this video will demonstrate,0.589,7.06
a possible way of solving for a patient,3.6,6.959
who needs an insulin drip we know that,7.649,4.86
with insulin drips that regular insulin,10.559,3.721
will be the insulin will use and we will,12.509,4.02
mix that with normal saline and so that,14.28,4.46
would be given as an IV piggyback and,16.529,5.67
let's say for this example that we have,18.74,7.51
in order to infuse the patient with 0.1,22.199,8.641
units per kilogram for per hour so we,26.25,10.01
have orders for regular insulin 0.1,30.84,10.379
units or kilogram per hour so with the,36.26,6.79
kilogram in there we notices weight base,41.219,3.57
we need to have a patient's weight and,43.05,4.11
in this case we will say the patient's,44.789,5.631
weight is a hundred and eighty pounds,47.16,5.969
also what we need is the insulin in the,50.42,5.74
piggyback so we're going to say for this,53.129,5.581
example that we have a hundred units of,56.16,5.129
regular insulin mixed into a hundred,58.71,11.76
units of normal saline we fix that here,61.289,15.811
a hundred units in 100 MLS of normal,70.47,13.05
saline okay so we with this 100 units,77.1,9.809
per 100 ml you also know that we are,83.52,5.7
going to have a concentration of one,86.909,7.471
unit per 1 ml okay so I can either solve,89.22,7.259
for MLS per hour I can solve for units,94.38,4.44
per hour let's go ahead and solve for,96.479,7.831
units per hour so I start bringing down,98.82,8.189
my information that I have I do know,104.31,8.4
that I have 0.1 units per kilogram per,107.009,8.701
hour so at this point I already have,112.71,5.39
what I'm looking for,115.71,5.04
but I do have a kilogram here that's,118.1,4.39
left over and I need to cancel that out,120.75,6.99
so one kilogram is equal to 2.2 pounds,122.49,11.19
and my patient weighs 180 pounds now,127.74,8.4
I'm able to cancel out and all that I'm,133.68,5.009
left with are the units I'm looking for,136.14,6.599
and then my math at this point we have,138.689,8.731
an eight point one eight units per hour,142.739,11.31
infusion okay and since we know that,147.42,10.17
this is a one to one ratio that I can,154.049,5.791
also then just say I have a one point,157.59,4.94
one eight ml per hour,159.84,8.039
infusion just to verify that through the,162.53,7.569
formula let's go ahead and solve for,167.879,6.181
mils per hour okay so now that I've,170.099,5.34
solved the units for hour,174.06,5.37
I'll take this answer here and I'll need,175.439,5.991
that in order to solve for mils per hour,179.43,8.539
so mils per hour I have 100 MLS in 100,181.43,10.539
units so I already have my top,187.969,7.24
descriptor but I still need hours so I,191.969,6.871
bring the hours from up here into my,195.209,7.801
problem I now take the eight point one,198.84,11.28
eight units per hour cancel out my units,203.01,9.569
at this point I don't even need this,210.12,5.67
little train track here because now I,212.579,6.15
actually have only left what I'm looking,215.79,5.339
for and then I come here and I say one,218.729,4.021
hundred times eight point one eight,221.129,4.681
divided by one hundred eight point one,222.75,3.629
eight,225.81,6.239
I also know that I can just take and,226.379,7.741
cross that out I'm left with my eight,232.049,4.53
point eight bring it over here and that,234.12,4.289
tells me that my eight point one eight,236.579,4.11
miles per hour is the same as my eight,238.409,4.53
point one eight years per hour which,240.689,4.23
that confirms that I have this,242.939,5.27
one-to-one solution,244.919,3.29
you,252.94,2.06
