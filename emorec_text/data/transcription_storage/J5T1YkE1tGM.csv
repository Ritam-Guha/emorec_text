hi I'm dr. January Hill the very,12.98,4.15
opportune general surgeon in Macon,15.69,3.33
Georgia and today we're going to talk,17.13,4.11
about recovery after bariatric surgery,19.02,5.88
so that is another common question I,21.24,6.539
hear about from patients number one,24.9,5.67
recovery time is a lot quicker than it,27.779,5.37
was historically generally speaking you,30.57,4.649
would have surgery in most people go,33.149,4.621
home 24 to 48 hours after their very,35.219,7.11
Ettrick procedure we do a fast track as,37.77,6.15
far as getting you up to walk,42.329,3.381
immediately after surgery,43.92,5.49
we also encourage drinking liquid diets,45.71,6.91
so your surgeon wants you to be actively,49.41,7.11
engaged in your activities after surgery,52.62,8.25
and once we discharge you home we expect,56.52,6.9
you to walk around most people can go,60.87,4.77
back to work in two to three weeks,63.42,3.57
some people take as long as six weeks,65.64,3.9
depending on what kind of what type of,66.99,6.66
job so your restrictions it might vary,69.54,6.39
based on your career so if you're,73.65,4.109
lifting if you're someone who loves,75.93,6.2
heavy boxes or 50 or 60 pound crates,77.759,6.571
probably keep you out for six weeks,82.13,4.33
because generally speaking a lot of,84.33,5.81
times the employers won't allow,86.46,7.71
restrictions so it just it varies but we,90.14,7.36
don't expect you to recover for surgery,94.17,5.64
for next six months people actually feel,97.5,3.93
better than expected it's pretty well,99.81,4.23
tolerant these days and we can know that,101.43,4.829
largely due to the fact that we do this,104.04,3.93
minimally invasive or laparoscopically,106.259,5.07
it's it's faster speedy speedy recovery,107.97,5.939
time and less pain so people who want to,111.329,6.36
get on about their lives one thing I,113.909,5.551
will tell you there is some gas pain,117.689,4.47
associated with bariatric surgery,119.46,5.339
because the way we do the operation we,122.159,5.521
do it using a laparoscope we make tiny,124.799,4.83
little incisions you're down the wall,127.68,3.93
and we pass trocars to,129.629,4.321
instruments and we also put up a camera,131.61,3.96
near your belly button well you could,133.95,4.56
gasp looking a TV screen operator or for,135.57,4.56
some people would play video games women,138.51,4.5
claim video games anyway with all that,140.13,5.52
gas we try to evacuate a lot of that gas,143.01,4.89
however there's still something that's,145.65,4.53
still trapped and your body has to expel,147.9,3.9
in one of the ways you can get rid of,150.18,5.52
that gas is to walk around okay no thing,151.8,5.46
your search has been asking are you,155.7,6.0
passing latest or okay so farting is,157.26,6.06
really good after surgery that's going,161.7,3.12
to help you feel better and expel the,163.32,4.17
gas so that is great try to let loose,164.82,4.2
there's no time to be shy I'm always,167.49,3.42
asking my patients did you fart,169.02,3.78
good morning okay because I want to hear,170.91,3.15
that and that helps relieve that,172.8,3.81
pressure so the biggest thing gasps pain,174.06,4.95
it goes up to your chest and neck so I'm,176.61,4.379
incisional pain but most people tolerate,179.01,5.55
it pretty well thank you for listening,180.989,5.641
