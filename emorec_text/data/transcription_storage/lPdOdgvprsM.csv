hey guys in this video we're going to,0.03,3.24
answer the question what is normal blood,1.439,5.46
sugar levels okay a lot of times you've,3.27,6.27
been told that it's between 8090 but it,6.899,4.351
really according to the American,9.54,4.019
Diabetes Association it really depends,11.25,3.66
on what year you're looking at because,13.559,5.191
in 1925 it was a hundred basically,14.91,6.6
between 90 and 120 okay that was normal,18.75,7.769
in 1968 it was 130 then in 1978 it was,21.51,9.589
115 milligrams per deciliter okay and in,26.519,9.331
1997 to 2003 it was 110 milligrams per,31.099,8.101
deciliter and then between 2004 and 2007,35.85,7.049
it's back to a hundred okay so my,39.2,6.07
opinion is that you need it between 80,42.899,5.34
and 90 but up to a hundred but here's,45.27,5.64
the thing there's an amazing book that,48.239,4.32
I'm gonna recommend you can get as a,50.91,4.26
Kindle it's called diabetes epidemic in,52.559,6.151
you by Joseph Kraft MD here's a guy that,55.17,7.77
"tested over 14,000 people over 25 years",58.71,8.82
and he evaluated their fasting blood,62.94,8.28
glucose levels and their glucose,67.53,7.409
tolerance test and their insulin levels,71.22,6.63
and he found something fascinating he,74.939,4.741
actually describes three patterns of,77.85,4.199
insulin okay so because he actually,79.68,5.49
checked fasting insulin and then post,82.049,6.601
meal insulin levels two three four I,85.17,6.15
think five hours and he found something,88.65,4.079
quite incredible,91.32,5.04
back in the 70s actually this is what he,92.729,7.381
found the absolute best indication for,96.36,7.91
pre-diabetes is not high fasting blood,100.11,8.88
sugars it is high fasting insulin levels,104.27,6.94
okay in other words you can have normal,108.99,5.4
fasting blood glucose levels and have,111.21,5.699
high insulin at the same time in fact,114.39,4.92
that was the case basically observed,116.909,4.82
that insulin high insulin comes first,119.31,7.019
then it's the high sugar okay but here's,121.729,6.971
the problem the doctors aren't testing,126.329,4.77
the insulin levels it's one of the best,128.7,4.92
indicators for pre-diabetes,131.099,4.021
so check this out when you have high,133.62,2.759
insulin levels what do you think that's,135.12,2.699
gonna do to your blood sugars it's gonna,136.379,5.61
bring it down not up so high sugar is,137.819,6.721
not going to show up until later you,141.989,5.101
might more likely end up with low blood,144.54,5.13
sugar hypoglycemia especially if the,147.09,4.259
adrenals are weak but of course the,149.67,3.33
adrenals if your Drina 'ls are strong,151.349,4.621
enough it will counter the hypoglycemia,153.0,4.92
so it'll bring it to a normal range and,155.97,4.97
this can go on for 10 15 or more years,157.92,6.72
so here you are you have you get tested,160.94,5.409
you have normal blood sugars and you,164.64,3.179
think everything is fine but you have a,166.349,3.72
lot of other symptoms you're tired after,167.819,4.17
you eat you're fatigued you're getting,170.069,5.161
fat you know all the other symptoms but,171.989,6.12
your glucose levels are normal I would,175.23,4.83
recommend the next time you go to your,178.109,4.651
doctor get your fasting insulin test and,180.06,5.399
see where the level is at all right,182.76,3.69
thanks for watching,185.459,3.78
hey guys I want to personally invite you,186.45,4.379
to a new Facebook group that I just,189.239,4.08
started called dr. Berg's Kido and in a,190.829,5.97
minute fasting lab okay so I created,193.319,5.7
this so we can share our successful,196.799,4.381
actions what worked what didn't work,199.019,4.62
