so diabetes is a very common problem,5.029,5.591
today we see that almost 14% or 15% of,7.47,6.48
people have diabetes and every other,10.62,5.79
person that you see may have diabetes so,13.95,4.409
every very often we have this question,16.41,3.42
what is normal blood glucose level,18.359,3.631
because apart from diabetes we also have,19.83,4.439
a condition called as pre-diabetes that,21.99,3.48
is where there is a high risk of,24.269,3.061
developing diabetes but that is actually,25.47,4.139
not there so what is normal blood,27.33,4.17
glucose level is if you look at the,29.609,4.38
fasting blood sugar level if you if you,31.5,4.38
give the blood sample in the fasting,33.989,4.23
stage and if the fasting glucose level,35.88,5.01
is less than hundred it is normal if it,38.219,5.401
is between 100 to 125 then what is this,40.89,4.47
is what is called as pre-diabetes and,43.62,4.83
above 126 your dial you are having,45.36,5.31
diabetes similarly if you look at the,48.45,4.65
post prandial that is or two hours after,50.67,4.56
a meal if you give a blood sample and if,53.1,4.32
the blood sugar value is less than 140,55.23,4.5
it is totally normal if it is more than,57.42,4.529
200 then the person can you can say that,59.73,4.56
the person has diabetes and between 140,61.949,4.561
to 200 is what is called as pre-diabetes,64.29,5.189
so these people who have pre-diabetes,66.51,5.16
have levels which are slightly higher,69.479,3.871
than normal but they don't have as high,71.67,4.23
levels as diabetes and these people are,73.35,5.04
have a high risk of developing damage so,75.9,4.44
if anybody has this pre-diabetes then we,78.39,4.74
should try to see that they prevent they,80.34,4.23
do not develop diabetes and we can,83.13,5.16
prevent diabetes in this situation we,84.57,6.39
can also use the hba1c level to diagnose,88.29,4.289
diabetes and anybody who has a blood,90.96,3.96
sugar level of me on sea level of more,92.579,5.131
than 6.5 can be said to have diabetes,94.92,5.67
now another important thing is that we,97.71,5.22
should always do these tests on more,100.59,3.93
than one occasion we can't just rely on,102.93,3.99
one test and say that a person has got,104.52,4.11
diabetes we should do it more than once,106.92,4.019
and then see whether the consistently it,108.63,4.18
is in that range,110.939,6.42
