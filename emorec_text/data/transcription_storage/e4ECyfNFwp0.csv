endocrinologist and a diabetes educator,3.12,6.96
so today we are talking about the beans,6.16,6.559
so i know a lot of you love beans and,10.08,4.4
there are some noise out there that says,12.719,3.601
oh don't eat beans it raises your blood,14.48,4.639
sugar well let's talk about this if,16.32,5.52
that's correct,19.119,2.721
okay guys so beans are delicious you,24.96,6.0
know everybody loves beans not everybody,29.039,3.68
huh a lot of people do,30.96,3.119
especially if you have a hispanic,32.719,4.0
heritage you probably cannot live,34.079,4.241
without beans right,36.719,4.721
and i am turkish we love beans too,38.32,5.68
it's a part of mediterranean diet and is,41.44,5.36
very healthy now does it spike your,44.0,5.2
blood sugar yeah well if you eat a lot,46.8,4.56
of it and anything with a lot of it will,49.2,4.4
spike your blood sugar but,51.36,5.44
why beans are actually not a bad food,53.6,6.24
for diabetes and what are all the health,56.8,5.68
uh benefits let's talk about that so,59.84,6.0
the beans are good because it is a great,62.48,6.56
source of protein and there's no fat in,65.84,4.88
it pretty much so there's i mean there's,69.04,3.84
no saturated fat at least in it,70.72,3.12
so,72.88,2.4
when you're eating red meat you're,73.84,3.52
having a lot of saturated fat that comes,75.28,3.839
with it there are some carcinogenic,77.36,3.36
factors that comes with red meat,79.119,4.401
especially the processed red meat versus,80.72,5.12
with the beans you're getting a lot of,83.52,4.88
protein you're getting a lot of fiber as,85.84,6.08
well remember fiber is very important to,88.4,6.16
slow the digestion and prevent the blood,91.92,4.879
sugar spike or at least slow the,94.56,5.12
absorption of carbohydrates and prevents,96.799,5.28
a rapid spike in your blood sugar now of,99.68,4.079
course let's talk about the nutrition,102.079,6.161
effects a little bit 1 3 cup of beans is,103.759,7.841
typically around 15 grams of carbs so,108.24,4.96
what i want you to do,111.6,5.36
go and get a one cup in us measure i,113.2,5.919
don't know how you guys measure in other,116.96,4.08
countries that you're watching but i can,119.119,3.441
only give you an example of u.s,121.04,5.359
measurement one cup see how much of one,122.56,5.199
cup is,126.399,3.121
what is one third of it because if,127.759,4.641
you're having a whole cup a full cup of,129.52,6.079
beans you're getting 45 grams of carbs,132.4,5.52
that pretty much puts you at maximum,135.599,4.72
limit of carbohydrates for your meal,137.92,5.44
if you're having beans and no rice,140.319,5.041
that's acceptable that's that's fair,143.36,3.76
enough but if you're putting your beans,145.36,3.599
on top of rice that's going to spike,147.12,4.24
your blood sugar if you're having bread,148.959,4.081
with your beans that's going to spike,151.36,3.28
your blood sugar so you have to be,153.04,3.199
careful about what you're having your,154.64,4.239
beans with now in the mediterranean,156.239,4.961
countries they actually cook beans and,158.879,4.72
they basically season it with olive oil,161.2,5.2
and with some spices it goes great,163.599,5.28
actually next to red meat as well so,166.4,4.88
instead of having your potato having,168.879,4.72
some beans next to your meat may be a,171.28,4.16
great alternative as well now the,173.599,4.481
glycemic index is not that high it's,175.44,6.0
good but again glycemic load can be,178.08,5.28
high if you're eating,181.44,4.159
like more than one cup of it so what are,183.36,5.76
the vitamins and minerals that are in,185.599,7.041
the beans there's a lot of folate,189.12,4.56
iron,192.64,2.08
copper,193.68,5.839
manganese potassium and vitamin k,194.72,7.04
so again you're getting a lot of,199.519,5.44
vitamins and minerals a lot of fiber,201.76,5.68
good amount of protein when you have,204.959,5.681
beans at a reasonable amount there are a,207.44,6.0
lot of studies also showing that eating,210.64,5.04
beans can reduce the risk of colon,213.44,5.2
cancer now as you know diabetics have,215.68,5.36
high risk of cancer of pretty much any,218.64,5.92
cancer so definitely having high fiber,221.04,5.919
foods in your diet such as beans will,224.56,5.039
help reduce the risk of colon cancer as,226.959,4.321
well so what is the downside of the,229.599,4.801
beans well if you're not used to it you,231.28,6.08
will have a lot of flatulence and gas,234.4,5.44
and that may be annoying especially in,237.36,5.2
the beginning so if you're not a bean,239.84,5.36
eater and you just get pumped up and you,242.56,4.959
want to go get some beans today oh well,245.2,3.92
you may want to,247.519,5.28
start slowly because those beans can,249.12,6.319
create even abdominal cramps if you're,252.799,5.84
not used to it so start with as i said,255.439,6.241
one third cup of beans and if you want,258.639,5.201
more later if you're not affected as,261.68,4.72
much you can definitely have more,263.84,4.88
up to one cup of beans next to your,266.4,4.239
maybe healthy meat,268.72,4.32
so i hope that helps you guys and if it,270.639,5.921
