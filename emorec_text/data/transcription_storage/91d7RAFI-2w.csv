hi guys in this video we're gonna talk,0.0,3.33
about low blood Sugar's in a minute,1.38,4.53
fasting and your liver I recently did a,3.33,6.3
video on talking about the adrenals and,5.91,5.16
low blood sugars in a minute fasting,9.63,2.879
today we're gonna talk about the liver,11.07,4.5
there is another hormone that is,12.509,4.381
involved that I'm not going to get into,15.57,3.99
that at this point now what happens when,16.89,6.42
you have a hypoglycemic reaction or low,19.56,6.18
blood sugars there's two main things,23.31,3.87
there's other things too but there's two,25.74,3.869
main things that will keep your Sugar's,27.18,6.809
high so to prevent the drop in blood,29.609,6.811
sugar okay the adrenals are one and then,33.989,4.89
the liver is the other one so in summary,36.42,4.5
if there's an adrenal issue you need to,38.879,3.901
focus on your sleep your B vitamins,40.92,4.83
potassium decrease stress to improve,42.78,5.4
that so you can have the adrenal glands,45.75,4.8
help you compensate and not experience,48.18,4.53
the symptoms of hypoglycemia which is,50.55,5.34
dizziness irritability and a great,52.71,4.829
difficulty in doing an amine fasting,55.89,2.73
because you have to go a long period of,57.539,3.57
time without eating and you don't want,58.62,4.079
to crash and burn and feel kind of funky,61.109,4.62
the primary target for hypoglycemia is,62.699,5.311
the brain okay so you're gonna have all,65.729,5.791
sorts of cognitive issues and mood,68.01,6.12
issues okay so if there's liver damage,71.52,5.16
if you have a fatty liver or you have,74.13,5.279
cirrhosis it's scar tissue that can come,76.68,5.07
from the fatty liver which both come,79.409,4.14
from high levels of insulin or insulin,81.75,3.57
resistance okay,83.549,4.081
that's gonna inhibit your ability to,85.32,5.1
store sugar in the liver the great,87.63,5.58
majority of all the stored sugar that,90.42,5.22
helps you between the meal to regulate,93.21,5.79
your fuel is called glycogen and it's,95.64,5.22
stored in the liver so if your liver is,99.0,4.29
damaged you won't have the capacity of,100.86,5.49
stored sugar to release and keep your,103.29,4.77
blood Sugar's normal when you're not,106.35,2.1
eating,108.06,2.46
okay so let's number one because you,108.45,4.47
just don't have the quantity of sugar to,110.52,4.65
stabilize yourself between meals because,112.92,4.65
the liver is fatty or there's some type,115.17,5.01
of damage to it number two you have a,117.57,3.93
problem with this other hormone called,120.18,4.68
igf-1 that's insulin-like growth factor,121.5,5.1
number one now what is that,124.86,4.23
that's another hormone that is very,126.6,4.529
similar to insulin but it works when,129.09,2.85
you're not eating,131.129,2.111
whereas insulin,131.94,5.11
converts things into fat IGF does the,133.24,6.3
opposite and releases the energy from,137.05,5.52
fat and stored sugar into energy between,139.54,5.7
the meals so you have these two things,142.57,5.52
working back and forth insulin triggered,145.24,4.74
when you're eating and IGF triggered,148.09,4.08
when you're not eating for the purpose,149.98,4.5
of maintaining blood sugars okay but if,152.17,5.46
there's damage to this hormone the blood,154.48,4.8
sugars can drop to low and you can have,157.63,4.38
all the problems of low blood sugar okay,159.28,3.99
so there's several things that can,162.01,3.18
improve i GF number one number one,163.27,4.23
keeping your insulin down by cleaning up,165.19,4.17
the diet not eating sugar,167.5,4.32
number two increasing exercise that will,169.36,5.91
help this right here in a minute fasting,171.82,6.42
which we'll come back to and sleep these,175.27,4.53
are all things that could improve this,178.24,4.23
in addition to fixing your liver if you,179.8,4.62
have a fatty liver you need to eat,182.47,4.35
healthy you need to take choline to,184.42,4.11
strip the fat off you need to do keto,186.82,4.25
and them and fasting but also cirrhosis,188.53,5.13
that can be improved if you're doing in,191.07,4.21
a minute fasting and there's also an,193.66,3.6
enzyme you can take called Serra pep,195.28,4.02
taste I'll put a link down below for a,197.26,3.99
video if you have cirrhosis you can,199.3,3.42
improve it so anything that will improve,201.25,4.17
the liver will improve IGF number one,202.72,5.13
and this works very closely with human,205.42,4.62
growth hormone they almost have the same,207.85,5.49
job so the whole goal is to go from one,210.04,5.28
meal to the next do intimate of fasting,213.34,4.26
over a longer period of time and prevent,215.32,5.01
the low blood sugar situation okay by,217.6,5.28
improving the liver and the adrenals so,220.33,3.36
when you're trying to do intimate,222.88,3.36
fasting some of the things in addition,223.69,6.02
to adding fat outside of vinegar,226.24,6.03
potassium B vitamins and going at this,229.71,5.62
very gradual is you want to improve the,232.27,8.84
liver by increasing something called,235.33,5.78
vegetables okay large quantities of,241.17,6.61
vegetables or salad it's kind of a new,245.34,5.619
concept so the biggest problem that I,247.78,4.89
see with people doing in a minute,250.959,3.541
fasting and they're having a hard time,252.67,3.39
is they don't consume enough vegetables,254.5,3.33
so I know you might not have a problem,256.06,3.12
with this but you probably know people,257.83,4.95
who just don't like vegetables but this,259.18,6.35
is really a very important thing to,262.78,3.99
increase,265.53,3.49
when you're doing a minute fasting that,266.77,4.86
goes beyond just eating more fat if you,269.02,3.989
don't have enough vegetables they're not,271.63,3.599
talking about just increasing potassium,273.009,4.171
I'm talking about all the other things,275.229,3.66
that are in vegetables that will,277.18,5.34
actually heal the liver and allow you to,278.889,5.761
go a long period of time without eating,282.52,4.32
so if you're having difficulty doing,284.65,3.63
intermittent fasting because of your,286.84,4.47
blood sugars you need to make sure the,288.28,5.58
Drina are good and the liver by,291.31,4.859
consuming more vegetables thank you so,293.86,5.1
