in this lecture we're going to discuss,2.419,5.861
inborn errors of metabolism and children,5.39,5.86
this is a very complicated field there,8.28,5.42
are experts who specialize in this alone,11.25,4.44
we're going to try and shed some light,13.7,4.329
in the complexity of this and give some,15.69,4.62
examples of errors of metabolism and,18.029,4.351
hopefully make it a little bit easier to,20.31,7.35
understand so here is glucose this is,22.38,7.83
the essential building block with which,27.66,5.399
we use to create all the energy we need,30.21,5.84
to run our bodies as you recall from bio,33.059,6.331
biochemistry glucose will be stored in,36.05,6.27
the liver as glycogen stored in glycogen,39.39,5.759
patients can have problems with storage,42.32,4.96
of glycogen this family of metabolic,45.149,4.771
disorders our glycogen stores diseases,47.28,6.33
we'll talk about those glucose is broken,49.92,5.97
down into pyruvate through glycolysis,53.61,5.039
and of course in the other direction we,55.89,6.57
have gluconeogenesis it is important to,58.649,6.181
understand that that breakdown can very,62.46,4.83
rarely have some problems but that's,64.83,4.8
pretty rare because you can imagine that,67.29,3.329
if you're having a problem with,69.63,3.65
glycolysis it's pretty hard to get by,70.619,6.211
glucose also is sent over to something,73.28,6.129
called the pentose phosphate shunt the,76.83,4.649
pentose phosphate shunt is responsible,79.409,5.631
for making NADPH and there is a disorder,81.479,7.53
g6pd which can cause problems with,85.04,7.439
creating NADPH because that diseases,89.009,6.691
symptoms are almost entirely limited to,92.479,5.051
red blood cells I want to talk about,95.7,4.32
g6pd during the heme lectures which,97.53,6.119
you'll see later pyruvate is sent,100.02,5.459
through the Krebs cycle to create ATP,103.649,4.5
the energy for which most of our protein,105.479,6.451
processes occur don't forget you that's,108.149,6.33
also how we can feed into the fatty acid,111.93,4.71
metabolism pathway and we'll talk about,114.479,4.561
some diseases of fatty acid metabolism,116.64,7.229
as well also during fatty Addyson,119.04,7.14
metabolism that's how we make ketones,123.869,4.411
patients may have problems making,126.18,3.87
ketones and we'll talk about some,128.28,5.43
conditions there as well the pyruvate,130.05,6.24
typically also sent over to start with,133.71,6.09
amino acid metabolism both metabolizing,136.29,7.92
but even more perhaps and handling amino,139.8,6.57
acids can be a problem that patient with,144.21,4.77
amino acid disorders so that some,146.37,4.44
patients will have certain amino acids,148.98,4.2
that they have a hard time digesting or,150.81,5.64
managing in an effective way and don't,153.18,7.05
forget amino acids may be disposed of,156.45,6.18
and in particular the nitrogen in amino,160.23,4.83
acids is disposed of through the urea,162.63,4.56
cycle and patients can absolutely have,165.06,4.26
your rhea cycle defects and we'll talk,167.19,4.32
about some of those as well so this is,169.32,4.95
the overview for metabolic pathways and,171.51,4.86
we're going to focus on some common,174.27,5.87
deficiencies in these pathways,176.37,3.77
