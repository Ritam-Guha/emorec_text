your blood sugar doesn't have all that,0.06,4.35
much to do with keto okay if you see,1.89,4.83
your blood sugar rising it doesn't,4.41,4.89
necessarily mean that you're not in keto,6.72,4.23
and it doesn't necessarily have that,9.3,3.0
much of a negative effect on your,10.95,3.269
ketogenic lifestyle I see a lot of,12.3,3.36
people that measure their success on,14.219,3.541
keto or measure whether a food is good,15.66,4.35
or bad purely based upon what their,17.76,4.65
blood sugar level is I got to break this,20.01,4.259
down because quite honestly it's way,22.41,3.9
different than what you might think hey,24.269,3.6
you're watching the Internet's leading,26.31,3.33
performance nutrition channel new videos,27.869,3.181
coming out every single Tuesday Friday,29.64,4.02
and Sunday at 7 a.m. Pacific time I also,31.05,3.75
want to make sure you head on over to,33.66,3.0
highlight com2 check out the pinion,34.8,3.21
performance apparel I'm always wearing,36.66,3.27
in my videos all right so what it comes,38.01,3.959
down to is two different things one is,39.93,4.77
called physiological insulin resistance,41.969,3.211
okay,44.7,2.49
physiologic insulin resistance is what,45.18,3.539
we actually want and I'll explain it in,47.19,4.349
a second pathological insulin resistance,48.719,4.02
is like what you get when you're,51.539,3.241
diabetic for example you see basically,52.739,4.41
in short what's going on is your body is,54.78,4.74
starting to refuse the acceptance of,57.149,4.531
glucose your cells are no longer,59.52,4.469
accepting as much glucose all right so,61.68,4.259
let's put this into context you've been,63.989,3.751
consuming carbs for most of your life so,65.939,3.481
your cells your muscles are all used to,67.74,3.12
using carbs then all of a sudden you,69.42,3.69
start keto so your body becomes fat,70.86,5.31
adapted it becomes used to using fats so,73.11,6.18
therefore those cells refuse the,76.17,5.46
acceptance of carbs well guess what,79.29,5.369
even though your body is refusing to use,81.63,5.58
the carbs it's still producing glucose,84.659,6.0
we always produce glucose we need,87.21,5.28
glucose within the body this means that,90.659,3.901
no matter what the body's finding a way,92.49,4.5
to create carbs it's creating glucose,94.56,4.349
from your protein it's creating glucose,96.99,3.75
from your lactate it's creating glucose,98.909,4.081
from all kinds of different processes to,100.74,4.379
function the specific cells that still,102.99,4.019
need glucose okay so when you're in keto,105.119,4.53
the liver produces ketones those ketones,107.009,4.921
fuel the brain then the muscles are,109.649,4.68
fueled by free fatty acids where does,111.93,4.38
this leave glucose this leaves glucose,114.329,3.661
in the equation for the small amount of,116.31,3.69
cells within the body that require,117.99,3.96
glucose that can't function on anything,120.0,4.049
else so this means that you still have a,121.95,3.93
physiological requirement for glucose,124.049,4.531
but most of your cells are denying,125.88,4.98
access with the glucose this means that,128.58,3.72
your blood sugar is going to be elevated,130.86,2.55
if you're in Quito,132.3,2.73
generally speaking so you might find,133.41,2.94
that your blood glucose goes up when,135.03,3.15
you're in keto although it probably,136.35,3.93
remains somewhat stable okay and you,138.18,3.42
might also notice that your blood sugar,140.28,3.15
is higher in the morning okay this has,141.6,3.18
to do with what's called the dawn,143.43,3.75
phenomenon the dawn phenomenon is where,144.78,3.93
early in the morning your body produces,147.18,3.09
a bunch of cortisol a bunch of,148.71,3.57
epinephrine a bunch of norepinephrine to,150.27,3.6
get you amped up and get you awake,152.28,3.42
well those catecholamines like,153.87,4.41
epinephrine and adrenaline they release,155.7,4.89
glucose into the blood that's part of,158.28,4.35
their whole process so no matter what,160.59,3.6
whether you're keto or not they're still,162.63,3.81
releasing glucose into the blood but you,164.19,3.99
just released glucose into the blood and,166.44,3.72
that glucose doesn't have a whole lot of,168.18,4.32
places to go because a vast majority of,170.16,5.43
your cells are refusing it so therefore,172.5,4.47
it stays in your bloodstream and,175.59,3.84
elevates your blood glucose then you go,176.97,3.72
and you eat some protein and that,179.43,4.47
protein gets converted into glucose so,180.69,5.28
your glucose goes even higher so you,183.9,3.96
start blaming your higher blood sugar on,185.97,3.51
all these different foods you're looking,187.86,3.18
at Oh what did I eat I ate this and it,189.48,3.15
made my blood sugar high it's kicking me,191.04,3.0
out of quito that's not the case this is,192.63,3.27
just the way the body works so your,194.04,3.9
blood glucose might go higher it doesn't,195.9,3.57
mean that your ketone production has,197.94,3.48
stopped so I don't want you to freak out,199.47,3.51
what you do want to be focusing on is,201.42,3.18
making sure that your blood sugar levels,202.98,3.45
are nice and stable you don't want big,204.6,3.81
spikes you don't want big Falls you just,206.43,3.51
want to keep it nice and consistent so,208.41,3.42
that insulin levels are low where they,209.94,3.84
should be and blood glucose levels are,211.83,3.39
nice and even where there should be as,213.78,2.52
always make sure you're keeping it,215.22,2.55
locked in here my channel you have ideas,216.3,2.97
for future videos make sure you put them,217.77,2.85
in the comment section see you in the,219.27,3.71
