diabetes can also affect the nerves,1.879,4.361
resulting in a number of different,4.41,4.2
neuropathies in fact diabetic neuropathy,6.24,4.56
is one of the most common complications,8.61,4.68
of diabetes affecting nearly 50% of,10.8,4.95
patients this can have a significant,13.29,4.53
impact on patients quality of life due,15.75,4.08
to difficult to manage pain as well as,17.82,3.33
being a leading cause of non-traumatic,19.83,4.199
amputations neuropathies can involve,21.15,5.28
peripheral nerves producing sensory and,24.029,4.5
motor symptoms as well as autonomic,26.43,3.66
nerves affecting the function of the,28.529,3.211
cardiovascular and gastrointestinal,30.09,3.96
symptoms sweat glands and sexual,31.74,3.87
function neuropathies can have a,34.05,3.39
significant negative impact on a,35.61,3.6
patient's quality of life but the,37.44,3.81
complications of neuropathy can be even,39.21,4.08
more serious loss of protective,41.25,3.84
sensation of the feet leads to foot,43.29,4.589
ulcers and amputations neuropathies can,45.09,4.469
cause balance trouble increasing risk,47.879,3.961
for fall and fractures and autonomic,49.559,4.5
neuropathy scan caused gastroparesis and,51.84,4.32
cardiac arrhythmias thus it's important,54.059,3.721
to recognize patients at risk for,56.16,3.87
neuropathy and intervene when possible,57.78,4.049
to prevent its development the most,60.03,3.869
important risk factor for diabetic,61.829,3.961
neuropathy is long-standing poor,63.899,4.26
glycemic control smoking and alcohol,65.79,4.32
intake along with metabolic,68.159,4.411
abnormalities such as hyperlipidemia and,70.11,4.799
hypertension may also increase the risk,72.57,4.619
of neuropathy let's start by taking a,74.909,3.771
look at peripheral neuropathy,77.189,3.601
recognizing neuropathy in your patients,78.68,4.18
is important for early intervention to,80.79,3.36
prevent progression and other,82.86,3.6
complications the most common form of,84.15,4.62
diabetic neuropathy is symmetric distal,86.46,4.409
sensory neuropathy this presents with,88.77,4.11
symmetric neuropathic symptoms and a,90.869,3.96
glove and stocking distribution it,92.88,3.83
develops following long-standing,94.829,4.321
hyperglycemia and involves damage to,96.71,5.019
small nerve fibers resulting in loss of,99.15,5.55
pain and thermal sensation it can also,101.729,5.611
damage large nerve fibers resulting in,104.7,5.22
loss of touch and vibration perception,107.34,4.8
and it can cause damage to sensory,109.92,4.68
fibers which causes paresthesias and,112.14,5.159
pain unfortunately there is no treatment,114.6,5.67
to reverse neuropathy thus prevention is,117.299,5.701
key for all patients with diabetes you,120.27,4.68
should perform a visual inspection of,123.0,4.02
their feet at each visit to ensure that,124.95,4.589
they have no ulcers or calluses and that,127.02,4.829
their shoes fit appropriately you should,129.539,4.331
also assess for loss of protective,131.849,3.97
sensation as this has been shown to,133.87,3.42
increase the patient's risk of,135.819,3.361
developing foot ulcers which can be a,137.29,4.02
serious complication of diabetes the,139.18,4.32
most commonly performed test to assess,141.31,4.349
for intact sensation is the 10-grand,143.5,4.56
monofilament test and this test a nylon,145.659,4.44
monofilament is applied to the plantar,148.06,3.989
surface of the foot with enough force to,150.099,4.381
cause the filament to buckle designed to,152.049,4.561
be 10 grams of force this should be,154.48,4.92
performed at four areas on the plantar,156.61,4.95
surfaces the site's most likely to be,159.4,4.11
affected in diabetic neuropathy other,161.56,3.78
tests that should be performed include,163.51,4.309
assessment of vibratory sense using a,165.34,5.19
128 Hertz tuning fork this should be,167.819,4.54
placed on the tip of the great toe if,170.53,4.56
the patient is unable to detect a,172.359,4.71
vibration while the examiner still feels,175.09,3.899
vibration this test is considered,177.069,4.351
abnormal assessment for intact,178.989,4.351
peripheral pulses should also be done at,181.42,4.05
every visit if there's concern for loss,183.34,3.899
of protective function or vascular,185.47,3.9
disease referral to a podiatrist should,187.239,4.11
be considered for evaluation of proper,189.37,4.11
footwear or other interventions to,191.349,4.771
decrease risk of ulceration diabetes can,193.48,4.619
also cause autonomic neuropathy,196.12,4.5
these may be difficult to diagnose but,198.099,4.681
can significantly impair quality of life,200.62,4.41
the autonomic neuropathy s can affect,202.78,4.59
multiple systems throughout the body one,205.03,4.289
of the most concerning complications of,207.37,4.229
autonomic neuropathy is hypoglycemia,209.319,4.621
unawareness where patients no longer get,211.599,4.591
autonomic symptoms associated with low,213.94,4.079
blood sugars they're at risk of loss of,216.19,4.019
consciousness or seizures related to,218.019,4.83
severe hypoglycemic events autonomic,220.209,4.14
neuropathy s can also involve the,222.849,3.78
cardiovascular system and cause resting,224.349,4.5
tachycardia or postural dizziness,226.629,3.961
autonomic neuropathy and the,228.849,3.631
gastrointestinal system causes,230.59,4.2
gastroparesis diabetic diarrhea or,232.48,4.17
chronic constipation erectile,234.79,3.9
dysfunction is a common consequence of,236.65,4.35
autonomic neuropathy and some patients,238.69,3.979
may also know hyper hydrosis,241.0,3.84
particularly with increased sweating of,242.669,4.121
the upper body and decreased sweating in,244.84,3.75
the lower body the treatment of the,246.79,3.659
autonomic neuropathy is aimed at,248.59,3.959
managing symptoms in order to improve,250.449,3.62
patient's quality of life for,252.549,3.99
hypoglycemia unawareness a continuous,254.069,4.241
glucose monitor can be life-saving,256.539,3.721
this will alarm as blood sugars start,258.31,3.84
dropping allowing patients to treat,260.26,3.81
their low blood sugar before they become,262.15,3.87
confused many of these patients also,264.07,3.67
need higher glucose target,266.02,3.459
to minimize the risk of developing,267.74,3.72
hypoglycemia for patients with,269.479,4.231
orthostatic hypotension increasing salt,271.46,3.929
intake in the use of compression,273.71,3.54
stockings can be helpful if these,275.389,3.571
interventions are not enough to control,277.25,4.169
symptoms fludrocortisone may be helpful,278.96,4.739
patients with gastroparesis may benefit,281.419,4.47
from dietary changes consuming several,283.699,3.62
small meals throughout the day,285.889,3.451
medications that may provide some,287.319,4.331
benefit include metoclopramide which,289.34,4.38
acts to stimulate gastric motility and,291.65,4.079
domperidone which is an option for,293.72,3.99
patients who do not respond to or unable,295.729,4.111
to tolerate metoclopramide this is not,297.71,3.929
available in the US but is available in,299.84,3.93
Canada and other countries erectile,301.639,4.051
dysfunction due to autonomic neuropathy,303.77,4.59
is difficult to treat but patients may,305.69,6.18
benefit from pde5 inhibitors recognizing,308.36,5.13
neuropathy is the first step in helping,311.87,3.269
your patients to manage their symptoms,313.49,4.23
so be sure to ask about symptoms at each,315.139,4.471
visit and treat as needed,317.72,4.259
