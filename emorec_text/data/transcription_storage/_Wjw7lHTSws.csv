hi I'm dr. Anand Raman consultant,5.569,5.32
endocrinologist at Magna clinic for,8.79,3.84
obesity that listening technology at,10.889,4.051
Bangalore people often ask they are,12.63,3.81
anemic called wheat world efficient,14.94,3.39
whether they can attempt weight loss the,16.44,3.509
answer to that is definitely yes,18.33,4.1
b12 deficiency and anemia are because of,19.949,5.91
micronutrient malnutrition so they are,22.43,6.55
typically because of iron deficiency or,25.859,5.49
because of b12 deficiency or some of the,28.98,5.669
micronutrient malnutrition and people,31.349,5.191
who are obese have micronutrient,34.649,3.721
malnutrition in the opposite direction,36.54,4.5
they are over nutrition so reducing,38.37,5.79
calorie intake is the important way in,41.04,5.82
which we reduce the weight so a diet,44.16,5.16
does not mean that you compromise the,46.86,4.14
quality of the food we can actually,49.32,3.809
maintain the quality of the nutrition,51.0,4.17
while reducing the quantity deliberately,53.129,4.101
so it's quite possible for someone with,55.17,4.77
b12 deficiency and anaemia to actually,57.23,4.899
go on a diet and reduce their weight so,59.94,4.71
what they need to do is you know make,62.129,4.471
sure that their honey mia is corrected,64.65,4.35
very quickly so that can be accomplished,66.6,5.04
by injectable bejewel therapy and also,69.0,5.549
with oral or IV and oral ion is not call,71.64,5.01
directed we can give IV ion also the,74.549,3.75
major challenge with attempting weight,76.65,3.42
loss when you're anemic or b12 deficient,78.299,3.301
is because of poor muscle function,80.07,3.659
exercise may become a little difficult,81.6,4.589
so once we correct anemia within a,83.729,5.1
couple of weeks good exercise capacity,86.189,4.531
can be restored and you can actually,88.829,3.9
attempt a good amount of weight loss,90.72,4.41
even while you know you are diagnosed,92.729,5.661
with anemia or b12 deficiency,95.13,6.359
