hi there my name is dr. Dominic Rowley,2.49,3.99
southern medical director of let's get,4.92,3.42
checked I'm here today to talk to you,6.48,3.96
about hepatitis namely hepatitis B,8.34,4.28
infection,10.44,2.18
so what is hepatitis B well hepatitis,13.9,5.25
there are a number of different types of,17.14,3.69
hepatitis infections a B being one of,19.15,3.9
them so there's also hepatitis A and C,20.83,4.32
and D and E infection but today we're,23.05,4.229
going to talk about hepatitis B so,25.15,4.23
hepatitis B is known what we call in,27.279,3.84
medicine and medical terms is a DNA,29.38,3.83
virus and it affects the liver,31.119,4.44
predominantly leading to a condition,33.21,4.09
called hepatitis which is inflammation,35.559,4.101
of the liver,37.3,2.36
Ohio's hepatitis B transmitted while,41.219,4.05
hepatitis B is transmitted in a number,43.71,3.0
of different ways the first way to,45.269,3.481
mention is through unprotected sexual,46.71,4.41
intercourse and this could be oral anal,48.75,5.37
or vaginal intercourse the second way,51.12,5.13
that hepatitis B can be transmitted is,54.12,5.55
to the sharing of needles or medical,56.25,7.5
infected medical equipment the third way,59.67,6.239
that hepatitis B can be in transmitted,63.75,4.68
is through the is through infected blood,65.909,4.07
products,68.43,3.96
the fourth way that hepatitis B can be,69.979,5.17
transmitted is through sharing of items,72.39,4.589
such as razors or toothbrushes because,75.149,5.72
hepatitis B is also found in saliva,76.979,3.89
so what are the signs and symptoms of,82.01,4.74
having hepatitis B well the good news,84.17,4.38
about hepatitis B is the vast majority,86.75,3.57
of us if we get infected with us we our,88.55,3.87
own immune systems clear the virus but,90.32,4.23
in a small minority of patients they,92.42,4.05
become chronic carriers so they have a,94.55,3.84
chronic hepatitis so that the virus is,96.47,3.92
always active in their bloodstream so,98.39,4.95
signs and symptoms of having hepatitis,100.39,5.29
would be you may feel you have a,103.34,3.99
flu-like illness so you may feel like,105.68,3.69
you've got a very severe flu you may be,107.33,4.77
suffering from extreme fatigue you may,109.37,4.62
develop abdominal pain particularly in,112.1,3.78
the right side here who your liver is,113.99,3.81
you might have liver pain and you might,115.88,3.69
develop signs and symptoms of jaundice,117.8,3.48
which is classically the yellowing of,119.57,4.65
the square of the eyes and you may,121.28,4.83
develop a severe itch and this is also,124.22,3.54
due to jaundice so they're just some of,126.11,2.7
the signs and symptoms of having,127.76,3.95
hepatitis B,128.81,2.9
so how do you go about getting tested,132.75,4.32
for hepatitis B the only way of getting,134.88,4.02
tested for hepatitis B is by having a,137.07,4.22
blood test,138.9,2.39
of hepatitis-b well as I mentioned most,143.68,4.71
pay most people most of us and clear,146.079,4.14
hepatitis B ourselves and we don't carry,148.39,3.89
a chronically we don't become chronic,150.219,3.901
chronically infected with hepatitis B,152.28,3.579
however for the small minority of,154.12,3.27
patients who do get chronically infected,155.859,3.6
hepatitis B it can lead to very serious,157.39,4.53
complications those complications as I,159.459,4.081
mentioned include hepatitis which is,161.92,3.36
inflammation of the liver,163.54,3.72
if hepatitis continues unchecked or,165.28,3.75
untreated it will lead to a condition,167.26,3.929
called cirrhosis this is hardening or,169.03,3.659
taking of the liver and the liver stops,171.189,3.871
functioning as it should and it can also,172.689,5.67
lead to heart failure cancer or cancer,175.06,5.629
of the liver,178.359,2.33
if you're concerned at all that you've,181.55,3.45
come into contact or you've been exposed,183.44,3.33
