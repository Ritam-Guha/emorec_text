it's increasingly evident that the,3.12,5.519
microenvironment provides,5.52,5.92
important drivers,8.639,4.481
important triggers,11.44,3.119
that,13.12,3.84
contribute to the,14.559,3.841
inherent,16.96,3.76
to the anti-apoptotic phenotype of,18.4,3.76
cellular cells,20.72,4.16
i mean i'll simply um,22.16,6.16
focus on what we have recently published,24.88,4.96
and,28.32,5.04
what we managed to show is a new,29.84,4.64
axis,33.36,2.719
a new,34.48,3.84
intracellular axis,36.079,4.721
that is however triggered by the micro,38.32,3.759
environment,40.8,2.4
so,42.079,2.32
in,43.2,3.519
a group of patients,44.399,4.761
that are highly responsive to,46.719,4.641
microenvironmental triggers,49.16,5.0
and this group broadly overlaps,51.36,5.039
with those carrying unmutated,54.16,4.8
immunoglobulin genes we find,56.399,5.201
considerable upregulation of a protein,58.96,5.76
called top 63,61.6,4.08
and,64.72,5.92
what we managed to show is that top 63,65.68,7.84
overexpression in those patients is,70.64,4.96
linked is accompanied,73.52,3.599
call it as you wish,75.6,3.44
with bcl2,77.119,5.481
over expression so bcl2 is a key,79.04,6.719
anti-apoptotic player in cellular cells,82.6,4.199
it,85.759,3.4
endows them with,86.799,3.921
anti-apoptotic,89.159,2.841
properties,90.72,2.64
in other words,92.0,3.84
they don't die when they should,93.36,4.399
so,95.84,6.0
what we showed is a link between top 63,97.759,5.841
and bcl2,101.84,3.919
and interestingly,103.6,3.12
a keep,105.759,3.601
a key player a key,106.72,7.84
implicated player in this axis is nf b,109.36,7.6
a master regulator of,114.56,5.64
b sulfate,116.96,3.24
