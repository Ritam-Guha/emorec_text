hey this is dr. berry in this short,0.11,4.479
video I want to talk to you about a,3.0,3.99
supplement that's very important for,4.589,4.621
anyone who's taking metformin or,6.99,6.059
glucophage to take it's a vital,9.21,6.03
essential mineral and if you are a,13.049,4.23
vitamin and if you don't get it you can,15.24,5.34
suffer severe long-term even permanent,17.279,6.451
consequences so let's talk about this,20.58,5.279
vitamin now if you know someone that,23.73,4.53
takes metformin or glucophage for,25.859,5.281
pre-diabetes for insulin resistance for,28.26,5.819
polycystic ovarian syndrome or for,31.14,5.669
infertility issues please share this,34.079,4.14
video with them because they really need,36.809,3.75
this information doctors are very busy,38.219,4.711
we try to remember to tell people to,40.559,4.651
take this vitamin but sometimes we,42.93,5.309
forget and so this is very important to,45.21,4.68
share if you know someone who's in that,48.239,4.021
boat now let's talk about this so,49.89,4.41
metformin are glucophage you may have,52.26,5.689
heard of this it's a very safe very,54.3,6.36
inexpensive medication that's first-line,57.949,7.96
treatment for PCOS polycystic ovarian,60.66,8.069
syndrome for pre-diabetes some doctors,65.909,4.411
even use it in insulin resistant,68.729,3.151
patients who are not pre-diabetic yet,70.32,2.76
and it's definitely one of the,71.88,4.02
first-line drugs used for type 2,73.08,5.039
diabetes like I said it's very cheap,75.9,5.88
it's the least bad of all the type 2,78.119,6.39
diabetes medications in my opinion it's,81.78,5.43
not perfect but out the reason that I,84.509,5.07
think it's okay to take for many people,87.21,6.75
is because it works by decreasing your,89.579,6.511
livers production of glucose it,93.96,4.589
decreases gluconeogenesis that's one of,96.09,5.099
the things that does what it does not do,98.549,5.011
is increase your pancreas it's a,101.189,4.921
secretion of insulin and so it doesn't,103.56,3.78
increase the insulin level in your,106.11,2.939
bloodstream which is a very good thing,107.34,5.48
it also makes your body's tissues more,109.049,6.57
sensitive to the insulin that you're,112.82,4.45
already making so your liver is more,115.619,4.771
insulin sensitive your muscles even your,117.27,5.52
ovaries and then a couple of other,120.39,4.32
tissues in the body may be even more,122.79,3.75
sensitive to the insulin you're already,124.71,3.99
making so it's mechanism of action is,126.54,6.27
very good in that respect but do also to,128.7,5.1
its mechanism of,132.81,3.99
action up to a third of people who take,133.8,5.58
metformin of glucophage if they're not,136.8,6.3
taking a vitamin b12 supplement they can,139.38,6.12
become either a little bit or a lot of,143.1,2.88
bit,145.5,3.81
vitamin b12 deficient and that's a big,145.98,6.84
deal if if you're older if you're over,149.31,5.52
50 you're actually much more susceptible,152.82,4.74
to this if you drink more than one,154.83,4.59
alcoholic drink a day you're much more,157.56,3.33
susceptible to this because alcohol,159.42,3.63
tends to also deplete your folate in,160.89,5.43
your vitamin b12 levels the deficiency,163.05,5.34
in vitamin b12 the reason we care about,166.32,3.78
is it can cause some pretty disastrous,168.39,4.62
symptoms but if you're a b12 deficient,170.1,5.37
for long enough it can become permanent,173.01,5.16
the damage can be permanent and so one,175.47,3.87
of the very first things most people,178.17,3.21
notice when their b12 deficient is they,179.34,4.23
have a peripheral neuropathy or a,181.38,4.02
neuropathy in their feet usually but,183.57,4.26
sometimes the hands as well described as,185.4,4.68
a pins and needles kind of feeling and,187.83,4.17
some people with type 2 diabetes have,190.08,4.05
this anyway and so it's hard to know if,192.0,4.8
it's from the b12 deficiency that they,194.13,4.29
may or may not have or just from the,196.8,4.5
diabetic neuropathy and so that's why,198.42,4.74
it's doubly important for somebody with,201.3,4.5
type 2 diabetes to take their vitamin,203.16,4.29
b12 every day and I'm going to tell you,205.8,3.93
at the end of this video which kind of,207.45,6.0
b12 to take so we've talked about the,209.73,6.03
the one of the things which is,213.45,4.62
peripheral neuropathy but other problems,215.76,4.97
that vitamin b12 deficiency can lead to,218.07,5.94
is worsening memory and if it goes on,220.73,4.99
for long enough it can actually lead to,224.01,4.38
a certain type of dementia which is can,225.72,5.37
be permanent so it's a big deal also a,228.39,4.89
vitamin b12 deficiency can lead to,231.09,5.399
decreased cardiac output your heart may,233.28,5.04
just not function as well as it could,236.489,5.521
otherwise if your vitamin b12 deficient,238.32,6.11
now there are multiple different b12,242.01,4.59
supplements you can buy on the market,244.43,3.55
but what I recommend you take is a,246.6,4.02
methylated b12 and I'm gonna put a link,247.98,5.61
down below to one that I know is is safe,250.62,5.549
and reliable the reason I say take a,253.59,4.86
methylated b12 is that there are,256.169,5.25
millions of people out there who have an,258.45,6.45
MTHFR gene mutation and they can't,261.419,6.131
methylate B vitamins so even if your,264.9,6.549
taking a good b12 supplement if the b12,267.55,5.97
is not already methylated and you have,271.449,5.25
an MTHFR gene mutation then you can't,273.52,6.359
utilize that vitamin b12 nearly as well,276.699,5.46
as if it were methylated so everybody,279.879,3.841
just ought to go if you're gonna buy a,282.159,3.72
b12 supplement get a methylated one that,283.72,4.02
way you don't have to spend the money if,285.879,3.451
money is an issue to find out if you,287.74,4.709
have the MTHFR gene mutation or not okay,289.33,5.1
so I'm going to put a link to the to a,292.449,5.22
really reliable methylated vitamin b12,294.43,5.91
down in the notes below so that's it,297.669,4.351
that's what you got to do if you're on,300.34,4.44
metformin or glucophage for any reason,302.02,5.22
any medical reason you absolutely must,304.78,4.889
take a b12 supplement and I recommend,307.24,4.919
you take a methylated b12 supplement now,309.669,4.321
