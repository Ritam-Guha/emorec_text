If you are somebody who has been told,9.957,1.377
that you need to lose 20 or 30kgs,11.334,2.256
and if you want to improve your diabetes,13.59,1.28
you need to completely change your exercise and activity levels,14.87,3.539
you may not have been told,18.409,1.178
what you need know.,19.587,1.577
And if you watch this short video,21.164,1.662
it will all become clear.,22.826,1.635
I just wanted to spend,29.611,0.867
a little bit of time explaining,30.478,1.435
this concept of the Body Mass Index,31.913,1.944
"and the 'ideal body weight',",33.857,1.548
so that you better understand,36.875,2.622
how achievable,39.497,2.13
really quite significant success is.,41.627,3.031
So the first thing is,45.848,0.873
about Body Mass Index,46.721,0.927
BMI,47.648,1.353
and simply,49.001,1.393
"it is a measure of your weight, in kilograms",50.394,3.5
"divided by your height, in metres",53.894,3.021
and for mathematical reasons,56.915,1.904
they square the height.,58.819,1.456
So if I weighed 60kg,60.515,3.612
"and I was 1.5m in height,",64.127,3.396
then it would be 60kg over 1.5 x 1.5,67.523,3.932
and that would give me my BMI.,72.245,1.287
"And the normal reference range,",74.452,1.977
"or what we call the normal range,",76.429,1.519
is based on clinical studies,77.948,2.663
that tracked the risk of somebody,80.611,3.284
developing a complication,83.895,2.591
and compared the risk to the Body Mass Index,86.486,2.905
and if I draw this,90.051,1.629
this is what we call a J shaped curve,92.8,2.894
because actually if you are too thin,97.064,2.036
"it is not good,",99.1,1.351
people who are very thin,100.451,1.738
often have higher rates,102.189,1.826
of risk of developing problems,104.015,2.119
and then as the weight goes up,106.864,1.16
there is an exponential increase in risk,108.024,2.352
that occurs as your BMI goes up.,110.376,1.846
"But there is a little spot, right down the bottom,",113.142,2.131
where the risk is at its lowest,115.273,1.701
and that is how we define,116.974,2.426
the normal reference range,119.4,1.252
and for most people that is between 20-25.,120.652,3.211
And so that is when we talk about,124.253,1.209
idea body weight,125.462,0.998
it is ideal because it has the lowest rate of risk,126.46,3.715
for things going wrong,130.175,1.031
so we think that is the most positive,131.206,1.437
place to be.,132.643,0.741
But what happens to people who are,133.564,2.968
significantly overweight?,136.532,1.428
"Perhaps their BMI is 30,",138.57,3.045
"so that is the definition of obese,",142.235,1.729
or 35 or 40,143.964,2.574
and if you start to plot that group of people,147.228,2.302
you can see that the risk,149.53,1.447
becomes incredibly high,150.977,1.795
for certain people,152.772,1.062
and the higher your Body Mass Index is,153.834,1.533
the greater the risk.,155.367,1.125
So people for example,157.242,0.936
with a BMI of 40,158.178,1.581
have a risk that is really incredibly challenging.,160.349,2.901
But the other interesting thing is,164.19,2.085
that if you can reduce your Body Mass Index,166.275,1.795
from say 40,168.07,1.67
down to 35,169.74,1.479
that is a substantial risk reduction.,172.379,3.834
And if you can reduce it from 35 down to 30,177.373,2.432
that is still a substantial risk reduction,179.805,1.947
but not as big as the person,181.752,2.051
that has reduced their weight from a BMI of 40,183.803,2.292
down to 35.,186.095,1.158
And if you go from 30 to 25,188.863,1.497
again there is further risk reduction,190.36,1.793
but it is not as substantial.,193.233,1.488
So whilst we talk to people about,195.451,1.808
their ideal body weight,197.259,1.331
and if they weigh 100kgs,198.59,2.321
perhaps their ideal body weight,200.911,1.05
"might be 70kgs,",201.961,1.174
in fact changing from 100 down to 90,204.355,3.769
has a profound effect,208.994,1.322
because a person literally slides down,210.316,3.449
the BMI curve.,213.765,1.251
And in doing so has a,215.886,1.899
massive risk reduction.,217.785,1.836
So the trick with weight loss,220.901,1.383
is not to think about what your ideal body weight is,222.284,2.495
because that actually,225.289,0.792
may be very difficult to achieve,226.081,2.141
"particularly if you are 30, 40, 50kgs",228.222,1.697
above what you should be.,229.919,1.223
The trick with weight reduction is to understand,233.272,3.154
the benefits that you get,236.926,1.823
by making small modest changes.,238.749,1.948
And just if we look at something like diabetes,241.417,1.964
if a person is able to lose about 10%,244.141,2.645
of their body weight,246.966,1.714
so if you weigh 110kgs,248.68,1.801
"then you are looking at 11kgs,",250.481,1.488
that has a profound impact,252.849,2.057
on how well your insulin works,255.846,1.451
"on your glucose control,",257.297,1.19
and your cholesterol,258.487,1.287
and your blood pressure.,259.774,1.021
It is not about achieving perfection.,261.665,1.656
It is about reducing risk as quickly,263.941,2.625
and as effectively as possible,266.566,1.504
in the most achievable way.,268.8,1.402
