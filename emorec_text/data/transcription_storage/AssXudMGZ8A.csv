"Sean Nalewanyj, here of EliteImpactLabs.com,
with the muscle in minutes Q&A, where I provide",1.59,4.71
"quick-to-the-point, no B.S.",6.3,1.5
answers to your bodybuilding and fitness questions.,7.8,2.59
"Today's question is on the issue of the glycemic
index and whether or not it is a useful tool",10.39,6.43
"when it comes to selecting carbohydrates for
your muscle building or your fat burning diet.",16.82,4.469
"So, for those of you who don't know what the
glycemic index is, it's basically a chart",21.289,5.24
"which ranks carbohydrates from 0 to 100 based
on how quickly they raise blood glucose levels",26.529,6.341
after they are consumed.,32.87,1.29
"And a lot of people will go with the idea
that they need to consumer ""Low glycemic carbohydrates""",34.16,7.29
"because these carbohydrates are going to -- going
to be broken down in a more gradual pace,",41.45,4.789
"provide you with more steady energy that are
less likely to be stored as body fat.",46.239,4.481
"The fundamental problem with the glycemic
index is that the rankings that are assigned",50.72,4.859
"to each carbohydrate are based on the effects
that those carbohydrates have when they are",55.579,5.441
consumed alone in a fasted state.,61.02,2.999
"Now, you almost never consume your carbohydrates
alone in a fasted state.",64.019,4.49
"You almost always combine them with proteins
and fats.",68.509,3.161
"And when you do combine them with proteins
or fats, for example, you take a white potato,",71.67,4.82
"which does have a fairly high glycemic index
ranking, and you combine it with a stake and,",76.49,6.129
"you know, some -- some vegetables, the entire
glycemic response to that meal is going to",82.619,5.27
be lowered significantly.,87.889,1.171
"So, there's no real way for you to even know
what the specific blood glucose response will",89.06,6.689
"be for specific carbohydrates as part of a
complete meal, just by looking at the glycemic",95.749,4.68
index alone.,100.429,1.701
"Choosing carbohydrates for your bodybuilding
diet is actually extremely straightforward.",102.13,5.25
"All I would really recommend that you focus
on is on getting the bulk of your carbohydrates",107.38,5.199
from higher fiber minimally refined sources.,112.579,3.481
"So, somewhere around 70%, 80%, 90% of your
diet should be coming from those types of",116.06,5.679
carbohydrates.,121.739,1.0
"So, we're talking about things like oatmeal,
you know, sweet potatoes, whole grains, fruits,",122.739,5.18
"vegetables, these types of carbohydrates.",127.919,1.771
"They're going to be higher in fiber, more
micronutrient dense.",129.69,3.241
"And as long as you're getting the bulk of
your diet from those types of carbs, there's",132.931,5.689
really no need to analyze it any further.,138.62,2.11
"Worrying about specific glycemic index rankings,
so low glycemic or high glycemic or the specific",140.73,4.649
"absorption rate of your carbohydrates, it's
really just a total non-issue.",145.379,3.33
"So, glycemic index is essentially a useless
tool when it comes to selecting carbohydrates",148.709,7.921
for your diet.,156.63,1.0
"Just focus on getting the bulk of those carbs
from high fiber minimally refined sources.",157.63,3.47
"If you're doing that, you can also get a smaller
amount from so called, ""Cheap foods"" as long",161.1,4.82
"as you're tracking it as part of your overall
macronutrient intake, but that's really all",165.92,3.67
you need to worry about.,169.59,1.0
