so the earlier,2.48,4.0
we intervene the more likely we are to,4.0,3.839
cure surgically,6.48,3.68
so microadenomas have a very high rate,7.839,3.201
of cure,10.16,2.88
macroadenomas that are more invasive,11.04,3.28
have a lower likelihood of,13.04,3.76
cure so the surgery is usually the first,14.32,4.24
step as long as there's a tumor that's,16.8,3.04
identified,18.56,3.12
and a good surgeon is really important,19.84,3.359
so someone who has,21.68,3.839
great experience in a number of,23.199,6.24
pituitary surgeries would be ideal,25.519,5.92
after the surgery we have to re-evaluate,29.439,3.921
that patient to determine whether the,31.439,3.921
growth hormone excess is still there,33.36,3.52
that can take a little time after the,35.36,3.519
surgery you can check growth hormone,36.88,3.44
right away in fact,38.879,3.36
day one and day two post-op levels that,40.32,3.6
are lower are associated with the,42.239,2.401
likelihood of,43.92,2.799
cure but the real proof of the pudding,44.64,4.0
will come with the igf-1 level which has,46.719,2.721
to be done,48.64,3.36
six to 12 weeks after the surgery and if,49.44,4.0
that's normal that patient is in,52.0,3.039
remission and can be followed,53.44,3.599
if that's elevated or the growth hormone,55.039,3.761
is elevated or their symptoms are still,57.039,2.16
there,58.8,2.559
along with elevated levels then medical,59.199,4.16
therapy is necessary and there's,61.359,3.681
many different medical therapies now,63.359,3.361
available,65.04,4.56
to treat uh persistent growth hormone,66.72,4.24
excess after surgical,69.6,2.879
failure we used to think that it was,70.96,3.44
just sporadic that there wasn't really,72.479,4.0
much genetics to acromegaly except in,74.4,3.68
rare syndromes but we're learning more,76.479,3.041
and more that there,78.08,4.64
that some of these cases can be familial,79.52,5.84
um the ones that we have the genes for,82.72,4.88
are complicated syndromes like multiple,85.36,4.24
endocrine neoplasia where there,87.6,4.24
are multiple endocrine tumors including,89.6,3.04
pancreatic,91.84,3.44
parathyroid and pituitary tumors and,92.64,4.24
they're not just acromegaly they can be,95.28,2.64
any of those,96.88,4.64
um cases and that's an men1 mutation,97.92,6.96
that occurs um straight through families,101.52,4.32
so they'll be,104.88,3.44
usually another family member involved,105.84,3.919
the patient could be the first one with,108.32,2.479
men1,109.759,4.081
and so if they have all more than one of,110.799,4.64
those endocrine tumors along with,113.84,3.36
acromegaly they should get tested for,115.439,2.881
men1,117.2,3.04
it's not usually found though and we,118.32,3.36
actually published a paper,120.24,3.28
very recently in the jcm looking at,121.68,3.479
patients with acromegaly and,123.52,3.52
hyperparathyroidism specifically for,125.159,3.24
men1,127.04,3.76
and all of our patients there were 22,128.399,4.241
that we described,130.8,4.96
were negative for the genetic testing,132.64,6.16
so um we this so there's other things,135.76,4.64
that explain these rare,138.8,3.28
cases of hyperparathyroidism and,140.4,3.28
acromegaly but if you,142.08,4.239
throw in a pancreatic tumor into the mix,143.68,5.199
then men1 becomes more likely or a third,146.319,4.64
tumor then it's likely to have the men1,148.879,2.72
other,150.959,3.681
genetic tests that can be done for cases,151.599,4.401
where there's more than one family,154.64,3.92
member involved as having acromegaly is,156.0,3.76
the aip,158.56,4.0
mutation the aryl hydrocarbon,159.76,5.119
interacting receptor protein mutation,162.56,3.84
which has been described in,164.879,5.201
familial cases of multiple pituitary,166.4,5.68
tumors in one family where you can have,170.08,3.6
more than one family member,172.08,3.76
that has a pituitary tumor and that type,173.68,4.24
of tumor is usually acromegaly so,175.84,5.2
if you have for example a parent and a,177.92,5.2
child or brother and sister,181.04,4.559
you you may have an aip mutation and,183.12,4.32
those usually will present at a younger,185.599,3.92
age of onset so they're more likely to,187.44,3.92
include patients that have gigantism,189.519,3.44
because they get the disease before,191.36,2.72
puberty,192.959,3.681
we're still learning about other genes,194.08,3.76
and trying to look for them when you,196.64,1.599
have,197.84,2.8
uh family members that have multiple,198.239,3.841
tumors,200.64,3.2
acromegaly and prolactinomas or,202.08,3.519
acromegaly and other non-functioning,203.84,3.679
pituitary tumors or just acromegaly that,205.599,4.321
don't have an aip mutation or an men1,207.519,3.28
mutation,209.92,2.8
and that don't have carni complex which,210.799,3.36
is the other gene involved,212.72,3.12
so there are a few rare genetic,214.159,4.08
syndromes that include multiple,215.84,5.6
endocrine tumors,218.239,5.681
some of them are just a pure familial,221.44,4.48
isolated pituitary adenomas syndrome,223.92,2.72
which is,225.92,3.599
associated with aip mutations but all of,226.64,3.76
those are rare,229.519,3.92
and the most common finding in a patient,230.4,4.559
with acromegaly is that they're the only,233.439,2.72
one in their families,234.959,2.801
that have known to have it and we don't,236.159,3.121
know the genetics involved,237.76,4.0
it's important i think to tell patients,239.28,3.519
that,241.76,3.44
they're not alone i think many,242.799,4.481
endocrinologists or primary care doctors,245.2,4.399
will have only one patient because it is,247.28,3.92
a rare disease and like all,249.599,3.761
rare diseases it can be a very lonely,251.2,4.48
feeling i would encourage um them,253.36,5.76
to get seen if they have you know any,255.68,4.72
residual disease at all,259.12,4.639
at a pituitary center one because these,260.4,4.72
these are going to be the physicians,263.759,3.201
that are most likely to be aware,265.12,4.799
of all the new available therapies but,266.96,3.44
also,269.919,3.921
they can then join in even in when we go,270.4,5.359
back to having live waiting rooms,273.84,4.56
um many other patients with acromegaly,275.759,3.281
and if not,278.4,3.359
there are online communities as well for,279.04,4.879
patients with acromegaly,281.759,4.321
so that you know they don't feel alone,283.919,3.601
and i know a lot of our patients,286.08,3.04
enjoy talking to other patients right in,287.52,3.2
our waiting room since we we specialize,289.12,2.88
in acromegaly and,290.72,2.8
in the days when we had patients in our,292.0,3.04
office they were able to chat,293.52,4.32
readily,295.04,2.8
