We just got back from one of out retreats.,20.25,2.83
"We hold these retreats a couple of times per
year.",23.08,2.15
"It's
an opportunity for people with type 1 diabetes,",25.23,2.469
"type one-and-a-half diabetes, pre-diabetes,
and",27.699,2.31
"type 2 diabetes to come together and learn
about the power of low fat plant based whole",30.009,6.001
"food
nutrition for significant improvements in",36.01,3.229
insulin sensitivity.,39.239,1.031
"We've held multiple of these retreats before
and every single time, we're able to promote",40.27,6.33
"a
significant improvement in blood glucose values,",46.6,3.59
"a reduction in insulin use, and a reduction
in",50.19,2.88
insulin sensitizing oral medication.,53.07,2.66
And we do it using the power of food.,55.73,3.46
"Now at our latest retreat, we had a total
f 14 people living with diabetes -- 7 of whom",59.19,4.89
"were living
with insulin dependant diabetes.",64.08,2.16
"Now in this article we're going to go into
detail about the results",66.24,3.89
"that each one of these people achieved in
improving their insulin sensitivity in as",70.13,4.22
little as 4 days.,74.35,1.81
That's right.,76.16,1.0
"We arrive on Thursday, we're there all day
Friday, all day Saturday, all day Sunday,",77.16,3.98
and you go home on Monday.,81.14,1.78
"And you would think to yourself, ""Well, in
4 days how much positive change can you really",82.92,3.79
"get in
improving your insulin sensitivity?",86.71,2.979
"Take a look below at the results that each
one of our insulin",89.689,3.47
dependant diabetics achieved.,93.159,2.201
"Now, let's go into a bit of detail here in
understanding what is insulin sensitivity.",95.36,4.59
"In the world of
low carbohydrate nutrition, you'll be told",99.95,2.989
"over and over and over again in that the only
thing that",102.939,2.661
"matters is how much insulin you're using per
day.",105.6,3.699
"That's why all the literature out there is
showing you how to minimize your carbohydrate",109.299,3.591
"intake so that you can minimize your insulin
use.",112.89,3.759
"In the world of insulin sensitivity, however,
your insulin use is just one variable.",116.649,5.39
"The other
variable which you have to take into account",122.039,2.79
is your total carbohydrate consumption.,124.829,2.771
"Insulin
sensitivity is defined as your total carbohydrate",127.6,4.65
"intake divided by your total insulin use in
a span",132.25,3.6
of 24 hours.,135.85,1.67
"And at this Mastering Diabetes Retreat, what
we do is we teach people how to",137.52,3.28
"migrate towards a low fat diet because as
soon as you achieve a low fat diet, then the",140.8,5.53
"amount
of carbohydrate that you can consume -- that",146.33,3.36
"your body can tolerate, that your digestive
system",149.69,3.2
"and muscles and liver can metabolize -- starts
to go up.",152.89,3.77
"So that means less fat, more
carbohydrate.",156.66,3.67
"So as soon as you emply this process, you
start to see that you're able to eat much",160.33,3.84
"larger
quantities of carbohydrates coming from fresh",164.17,2.05
"fruits and fresh vegetables for smaller insulin
use.",166.22,4.84
"I'll repeat that: more carbohydrate for less
insulin.",171.06,4.02
"Now out first retreat attendee attended the
retreat eating 150 grams of carbohydrate in",175.08,5.59
"her
previous diet, and she used a total of 88.2",180.67,6.06
"units of insulin, which means that her 24
hour insulin",186.73,2.75
sensitivity was about 1.7.,189.48,3.88
"During the retreat, we instructed her to increase
her carbohydrate",193.36,3.65
intake while reducing her fat intake.,197.01,2.3
"She was able to consume an average of 257
grams of",199.31,3.27
"carbohydrate and her insulin use fell to 58.6
units for a 24-hour insulin sensitivity of",202.58,7.95
4.4.,210.53,1.94
"So you
can see that her change in insulin sensitivity",212.47,3.54
over this 4-day period was 258%.,216.01,4.68
This is what happened in the first 4 days.,220.69,2.86
"Imagine as soon as she returns to her normal
life and",223.55,2.79
continues this approach.,226.34,1.58
"Her insulin use is likely to continue falling
and her carbohydrate intake",227.92,4.27
"is likely to continue increasing as she controls
her blood glucose with more and more precision.",232.19,6.26
"Now out second attendee increased her total
insulin sensitivity by a total of 309%, and",238.45,5.941
"she did
this by increasing her carbohydrate intake",244.391,3.249
only by about 50 grams per day.,247.64,2.81
"But as you can see,
her total insulin use went from 50 units per",250.45,4.31
day all the way down to 22 units per day.,254.76,2.75
"So what
that means is that she's eating more carbohydrate,",257.51,2.34
"but she cut her insulin use in half in only
a 4-",259.85,4.07
day period.,263.92,1.0
"And as a result of that her total insulin
sensitivity increased by a total of 309%.",264.92,5.36
"The third person increased her carbohydrate
intake from an average of about 200 grams",270.28,4.41
"per
day all the way up to about 300 grams per",274.69,3.31
"day, and in this process she also cut her
insulin use",278.0,3.84
by 50%.,281.84,2.12
"You can see here she started out using a total
of 60 units per day, divided about in half",283.96,4.58
"between basal and bolus, and reduced it all
the way down to 30 units per day.",288.54,6.12
"As a result, she
increased her insulin sensitivity by a total",294.66,2.57
of 299%.,297.23,3.68
"Our next attendee increased her carbohydrate
intake by twofold.",300.91,4.7
"In other words, she started to
eat double the amount of carbohydrate that",305.61,3.92
"she ate when she previously came -- 208 grams
versus about 110 grams previously.",309.53,6.18
"As a result of that, her insulin use fell
from 43.6 units per",315.71,4.29
"day all the way down to 27.6 units per day,
giving her an increase in her total insulin",320.0,6.86
"sensitivity
of about 162%.",326.86,4.7
"This gentleman increased his carbohydrate
intake from 275 grams per day all the way",331.56,5.38
"up to 422
grams per day, and in the process he was able",336.94,4.27
"to cut about 8 units of insulin off of his
standard",341.21,3.5
baseline of 37 units per day.,344.71,2.56
"What that means is that his insulin sensitivity
went from a 7.4 all",347.27,4.37
"the way to a 14.4, which is a change of about
193%.",351.64,6.11
"Our next attendee increased her carbohydrate
intake by about 50%.",357.75,4.99
"She went from about 100
grams per day to about 142 grams per day.",362.74,4.23
"Now you'll notice here that her insulin use
actually",366.97,2.48
"slightly went up, and the reason for that
is simple.",369.45,3.88
"Before she came to the retreat, she was
using only basal insulin - zero bolus units",373.33,5.26
per day.,378.59,2.3
"In the retreat, we showed her how to
decrease her basal use of insulin.",380.89,5.95
"And in the process, she found that she needed
a little bit",386.84,1.92
more bolus insulin.,388.76,1.64
"So her total insulin use actually climbed
from 18 units per day to about 23",390.4,4.41
units per day.,394.81,1.34
"Despite that slight increase in her insulin
usage, her insulin sensitivity still went",396.15,5.46
up.,401.61,1.17
"So in the first 4 days, she noticed about
111% increase in her insulin sensitivity.",402.78,5.98
"So you can see in each of these situations
how adopting a low fat whole food plant based",408.76,5.12
"approach makes significant changes in a very
short period of time.",413.88,4.16
"Now, each of these
attendees has gone back to their life, has",418.04,4.1
"gone back to their daily routine, but done
so by",422.14,3.56
"changing the food that they are eating and
changing their movement patterns according",425.7,3.93
"to what
they learned while at the retreat.",429.63,3.31
"What you're looking at here is just the tip
of the tip of the tip of the iceberg because",432.94,3.97
"this 4-day
period for a lot of individuals is just a",436.91,2.98
"launching point into a brand new lifestyle
that leads to",439.89,3.39
"improved insulin sensitivity over the course
of time.",443.28,3.15
"Now we like to talk about the fact that this
is just biology.",446.43,3.38
"We understand the biology of diabetes
and insulin resistance better than most people.",449.81,5.14
"And as a result of that, simply integrating
a low",454.95,2.77
"fat plant based whole foods approach, we can
see dramatic differences in a short period",457.72,3.65
"of time
that then lead to dramatic differences in",461.37,2.59
the long-term.,463.96,1.62
"Now whether you're interested in participating
in a coaching program, showing up to one of",465.58,3.93
"our
retreats, or just doing this on your own,",469.51,2.12
the world is your oyster.,471.63,1.259
"Keep in touch with us, let us
know how we can help you, and we hope that",472.889,3.31
"we can get the same results for you that you
saw",476.199,2.651
for all the other retreat attendees.,478.85,1.93
