hi my name is Jennifer de Rossi DeCosta,8.62,4.95
I'm a certified diabetes educator and,11.23,4.14
registered nurse for Southwest hospitals,13.57,3.54
group and today I'd like to talk to you,15.37,4.47
about insulin pump therapy insulin pumps,17.11,5.13
are small page like devices that deliver,19.84,4.74
insulin they deliver insulin in two,22.24,4.29
different ways one way is that it,24.58,4.35
delivers insulin in a slow fashion a,26.53,4.589
continuous fashion which is called a,28.93,4.23
basal rate this basal rate runs,31.119,5.251
continuously for 24 hours it's very,33.16,4.89
similar to what you might already be,36.37,4.02
using for insulin called Lantis or 11:00,38.05,4.439
ER which is continuous or slow acting,40.39,5.58
the insulin pump also uses insulin and,42.489,5.611
delivers it in a quick way it delivers,45.97,4.23
insulin as a large burst of insulin,48.1,3.15
which is called,50.2,3.359
a bolus a bolus would be delivered,51.25,4.079
through the pump anytime that you eat,53.559,4.081
grams of carbohydrate or anytime your,55.329,4.89
blood sugar is elevated for instance if,57.64,4.259
your blood sugar is above your target,60.219,4.171
you would give more insulin that's,61.899,5.401
called the bolus now I know this sounds,64.39,4.649
difficult to understand but actually,67.3,3.27
insulin pumps are pretty easy to use,69.039,3.901
prior to someone going on an insulin,70.57,4.32
pump you would be thoroughly trained on,72.94,3.959
how to use these now to clear up some,74.89,6.03
misconceptions insulin pumps are easy to,76.899,6.36
use with training there is not a,80.92,4.289
surgical procedure there's no surgery,83.259,5.161
involved most people feel that insulin,85.209,4.981
pumps are probably too fragile for your,88.42,3.42
lifestyle and that's actually a,90.19,2.55
misconception,91.84,3.27
insulin pumps are used by all types of,92.74,4.14
people from children to professional,95.11,5.459
athletes in addition to that pumps do,96.88,5.67
not know what your blood Sugar's are you,100.569,3.72
still have to monitor your blood sugar,102.55,3.84
and you basically tell the pump how much,104.289,4.291
insulin to give it does not know what,106.39,4.56
your blood sugars are so hopefully this,108.58,3.929
gets you thinking about what insulin,110.95,3.75
pumps are all about and we hope to see,112.509,3.961
you here I think it's a great tool for,114.7,3.93
people to use in fact I personally use,116.47,4.22
an insulin pump for the last 15 years,118.63,4.409
hope to see you at the diabetes program,120.69,4.269
at South Coast Hospitals group our,123.039,4.14
number is five zero eight three two four,124.959,5.991
three two six zero thank you,127.179,3.771
