what is the glycemic load and why does,0.24,4.72
it matter more than the glycemic index,2.48,3.44
let's science it,4.96,4.0
[Music],5.92,5.36
hey welcome to nourishment i'm dr lara,8.96,4.16
you may be familiar with the glycemic,11.28,4.479
index or gi because it's frequently,13.12,5.2
recommended to eat low gi foods for,15.759,5.121
health the glycemic index is a method,18.32,4.64
used to categorize foods based on how,20.88,4.319
they impact your blood glucose the way,22.96,4.319
this works is the blood glucose response,25.199,4.16
to a test food say this whole wheat,27.279,4.96
bread is measured over two hours and,29.359,4.321
it's compared to the blood glucose,32.239,3.521
response for a reference food like a,33.68,4.64
sugar drink based on these comparisons,35.76,5.2
foods can be categorized as low gi,38.32,4.16
meaning that they don't raise your blood,40.96,2.8
glucose much,42.48,4.32
medium gi or high gi meaning that they,43.76,5.2
raise your blood glucose a lot so it,46.8,3.919
follows that if you want to avoid high,48.96,3.599
spikes in blood glucose that you should,50.719,4.401
avoid high gi foods right,52.559,4.401
well it's a bit more complicated than,55.12,4.0
that because here's the thing the method,56.96,4.16
for determining the glycemic index,59.12,4.56
requires eating 50 grams of digestible,61.12,4.96
carbohydrate so that's 50 grams of,63.68,5.2
sucrose in the sugar drink or 50 grams,66.08,5.2
of carbs minus the fiber in the whole,68.88,4.72
wheat bread and depending on the test,71.28,4.64
food sometimes 50 grams of carbs is a,73.6,4.32
way bigger serving size than you'd ever,75.92,4.239
reasonably eat in a sitting when i did,77.92,4.559
my gi experiment with dave's killer seed,80.159,5.201
bread not an ad just a fan i had to eat,82.479,5.521
three full slices to get 50 grams of,85.36,4.88
digestible carbs that's more than i'd,88.0,4.4
usually eat this conundrum is even more,90.24,4.64
striking with watermelon i'd need to eat,92.4,4.24
four and a half cups of watermelon to,94.88,4.48
get 50 grams of digestible carbs that's,96.64,4.799
nearly an entire watermelon,99.36,3.68
previous studies have calculated the,101.439,4.801
glycemic index of watermelon to be 76,103.04,6.64
which categorizes it as a high gi food,106.24,5.28
but if we want a tool to help predict,109.68,3.92
glycemic responses in the real world we,111.52,4.239
need to take typical serving sizes into,113.6,3.6
consideration,115.759,4.0
and that's where glycemic load comes in,117.2,5.76
the glycemic load or gl is a ranking,119.759,5.36
system that corrects the glycemic index,122.96,3.92
for the number of carbohydrates in a,125.119,3.601
typical serving size,126.88,4.48
to calculate the gl you simply multiply,128.72,4.48
the number of digestible carbs in a,131.36,5.36
serving by the gi and divide by 100 we,133.2,6.72
know that watermelon has a high gi of 76,136.72,6.239
but it's mostly water a typical 100 gram,139.92,5.679
serving of watermelon has 7 grams of,142.959,4.321
digestible carbs,145.599,4.401
to calculate the gl we take that 7 gram,147.28,5.28
serving of carbs multiplied by the gi of,150.0,6.319
76 and divide by 100 to give us a gl of,152.56,4.8
five,156.319,3.92
foods are categorized into low medium or,157.36,6.239
high gl where a lower gl means a serving,160.239,6.321
of food raises your blood glucose less,163.599,5.36
this categorizes watermelon as a low,166.56,5.44
glycemic load food so a typical serving,168.959,5.441
size won't cause a huge spike in blood,172.0,4.959
glucose overall the glycemic load is a,174.4,4.479
better reflection of expected blood,176.959,4.0
glucose responses to foods based on how,178.879,4.561
much we usually eat in a serving that,180.959,4.321
makes it more useful than the glycemic,183.44,3.6
index there are still some more,185.28,3.92
complications with the applicability of,187.04,4.64
the glycemic load in the real world and,189.2,4.72
i dig into them in my glycemic responses,191.68,4.639
