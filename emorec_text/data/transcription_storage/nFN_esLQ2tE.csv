hello i'm dr mita ratan and this channel,0.08,4.4
is dedicated to skin careful skin,2.159,4.561
of color as you know i'm a doctor but,4.48,3.84
i'm also a cosmetic formulator,6.72,3.839
specifically for skin of color,8.32,4.88
so today's video is all about acanthosis,10.559,4.401
 cans it's something that really,13.2,3.68
does affect the skin of color community,14.96,4.72
but we don't discuss it enough as with,16.88,4.479
many of the topics when it comes to skin,19.68,2.0
care,21.359,1.92
when people would come into my clinic,21.68,3.599
for pigmentation and they would have,23.279,4.24
darker necks or dark darker under the,25.279,4.4
arms they would think it was purely a,27.519,3.76
pigmentation issue when,29.679,3.681
actually there was more going on so,31.279,4.001
today's video is really addressing it,33.36,4.24
how do we treat it uh what really is,35.28,3.76
going on with the skin if that sounds,37.6,2.72
good to you give me a thumbs up let's,39.04,6.8
dive right in,40.32,5.52
so what it looks like is thickened,52.64,4.32
velvety skin that's how we describe it,54.719,3.761
and you typically see it at the back of,56.96,3.52
the neck under the arms in the groin,58.48,3.68
area and at the back of the knees,60.48,4.56
acanthus cans is also associated,62.16,5.36
with diabetes and with obesity which is,65.04,4.24
why it's becoming more prevalent,67.52,3.36
in our skin of color communities,69.28,3.6
especially as our diet is changing,70.88,4.16
towards more of a western diet so what,72.88,4.0
actually is happening to our skin,75.04,4.64
so what happens is between the epidermis,76.88,4.72
and dermis we have the basal layer,79.68,4.079
that's where the melanocytes live,81.6,5.199
and what happens is insulin basically,83.759,5.201
goes through passes through the basal,86.799,3.68
layer and,88.96,3.68
will meet with keratinocytes in the,90.479,3.121
epidermis,92.64,2.479
insulin will bind with these,93.6,4.0
insulin-like growth factor receptors,95.119,4.921
they will stimulate fibroblasts and,97.6,3.839
keratinocytes,100.04,4.119
and this will lead to thickened velvety,101.439,3.121
skin,104.159,3.28
now the most common cause of acanthosis,104.56,3.919
micro cans is,107.439,4.081
obesity 50 of those who wear,108.479,4.881
weigh more than double their recommended,111.52,3.2
weight will get,113.36,4.079
acanthus cans so the number one,114.72,4.399
thing that you need to do to treat this,117.439,5.36
is to lose weight because you want to,119.119,6.64
increase sensitivity of insulin which,122.799,4.081
means that you have less,125.759,3.601
insulin than flooding the system this is,126.88,3.519
really important,129.36,3.2
it's instrumental to break this vicious,130.399,3.441
cycle that's taking place,132.56,2.96
additional things that you can do are,133.84,3.2
either oral or,135.52,3.92
topical vitamin a so retinoids because,137.04,3.839
that what that does is helps,139.44,3.519
increase cell turnover you can use,140.879,3.041
gentle peels,142.959,3.441
such as mandelic acid but until you,143.92,4.16
treat the root cause you're going to be,146.4,3.919
getting temporary results at best,148.08,4.159
in addition any tyrosinase inhibitors,150.319,3.92
that you use are going to struggle,152.239,3.681
to get through the thickened skin in,154.239,3.441
order to reach the basal layer where the,155.92,2.959
melanocytes live,157.68,3.44
one thing i would say to avoid are,158.879,4.241
lasers for skin of color to try and,161.12,3.839
treat this pigmentation because,163.12,3.68
you can burn the skin and get more,164.959,4.56
pigmentation it's just not even worth,166.8,4.4
the wrist profile isn't worth it for,169.519,3.601
skin of color so the routine i would,171.2,2.399
give you,173.12,2.32
is when you wash first in the morning,173.599,3.241
make sure you're using a,175.44,2.56
non-inflammatory,176.84,2.679
product so something with no fragrance,178.0,3.519
in it that's hypoallergenic,179.519,4.161
hypoallergenic so you do that first and,181.519,2.72
then,183.68,2.96
i would apply either moisturizers such,184.239,4.241
as citrobin or cerave,186.64,3.519
and then apply your sunscreen especially,188.48,3.6
if you've got if you're exposing it to,190.159,2.561
uv,192.08,3.2
so i would recommend that you go with,192.72,3.04
them,195.28,3.599
with zinc oxide mineral sunscreen just,195.76,3.92
because,198.879,3.121
it's anti-inflammatory too which you,199.68,3.04
really,202.0,2.48
are trying to soothe the skin as much as,202.72,4.079
possible with acanthosis niagara cans,204.48,3.839
at night time if you want to try a,206.799,3.601
retinol then what i would recommend,208.319,4.56
is wash under the arms and around the,210.4,3.199
neck area,212.879,3.841
apply 0.5 percent retinol from,213.599,5.761
the ordinary or try 0.3 percent from,216.72,3.519
paula's choice,219.36,3.36
you could potentially go up a little bit,220.239,3.92
higher in terms of strength,222.72,4.079
but i would start off carefully because,224.159,4.16
i don't want you to be getting,226.799,3.201
to it to irritate the skin and then get,228.319,4.56
more pigmentation so start off at 0.5,230.0,3.519
percent,232.879,3.121
or the 0.3 from paula's choice so you,233.519,3.521
moisturize first,236.0,2.959
then the retinol and then moisturize,237.04,3.919
again that's called the retinol sandwich,238.959,3.681
alternatively if you decide i just want,240.959,3.28
to treat the pigmentation,242.64,4.08
then go straight in with your tyrosinase,244.239,3.28
inhibitors,246.72,3.28
so don't moisturize wash have clean skin,247.519,4.0
and then pop on the tyrosinase,250.0,2.72
inhibitors because you want to get,251.519,3.041
maximum penetration of those actives,252.72,3.6
into the skin so things like,254.56,3.44
alpha arbutin from the ordinary is very,256.32,4.159
good or niacinamide many different,258.0,4.16
brands now do niacinamide the other good,260.479,3.121
one is tranexamic acid,262.16,2.8
at the inky list that's a really good,263.6,3.039
one and then you can moisturize,264.96,3.36
you do that for about three to six,266.639,3.521
months if you're seeing results great,268.32,3.52
if you decide you need to upgrade then,270.16,4.479
you can always use the dr v,271.84,4.96
body pigmentation kit which has got 10,274.639,4.881
tyrosinase inhibitors in them,276.8,5.52
often with skin of color our melanocytes,279.52,4.56
are very difficult to treat,282.32,4.319
and one or two actives isn't going to be,284.08,4.559
enough regardless even if you're using,286.639,3.761
the body pigmentation kit you are going,288.639,3.681
to have to get the glucose under control,290.4,3.76
otherwise no matter what you do is going,292.32,3.439
to be temporary you know it's really,294.16,2.96
important to do that i don't want to,295.759,2.801
waste your money with anybody,297.12,3.519
so just for your own knowledge the 10,298.56,3.44
tyrosines inhibitors,300.639,3.441
in the dr v body pigmentation kit the,302.0,4.8
skin of color are alpha rb10 vitamin c,304.08,4.72
uh water soluble sodium scuba phosphate,306.8,4.48
fat soluble tetrahexal dichloroscorbate,308.8,5.679
and acetyl glucosamine dioric acid uh,311.28,5.6
salicylic acid kojic dipalmate licorice,314.479,4.321
extract three forms of vitamin a,316.88,4.08
that's retinol retinaldehyde and retinol,318.8,3.119
palmitate,320.96,3.28
plus your vitamin e just so that you are,321.919,4.241
