to the affected portion in this case the,0.06,6.36
foot so what we have on the right foot,4.04,5.86
is we have a mummified toe the second,6.42,7.53
toe is actually not living at this point,9.9,8.82
the third toe was amputated and that was,13.95,7.02
a couple of weeks ago and then now as,18.72,4.29
everyone can see the fourth toe is dusky,20.97,5.25
it's actually purple bluish in color and,23.01,5.4
this extends around this area as well,26.22,5.25
the thick toe I won't have you come,28.41,6.69
around here but the the fifth toe is,31.47,8.55
also turning this color as well so this,35.1,7.41
portion of the foot there is a very very,40.02,7.14
high likelihood that he may lose a,42.51,8.819
portion of this foot and again what,47.16,5.879
we're trying to do is save as much as we,51.329,3.931
can we're letting the area demarcate and,53.039,4.68
let the body actually decide what it,55.26,5.25
wants to keep and whatever it does not,57.719,4.801
in respect to the left foot the same,60.51,4.649
thing is actually occurring he did have,62.52,4.889
just to let people know how brittle,65.159,4.411
these these patients are he apparently,67.409,4.471
bumped a tiny little of the tip of the,69.57,7.26
toe and then led him to this right you,71.88,7.83
sigh from from the obvious the dark part,76.83,5.01
which is the tissue that is not living,79.71,4.199
you can actually sell ready see the,81.84,4.709
purple color and I'm not going to let,83.909,4.861
you guys see this but I'll you know the,86.549,4.201
bottom is also a little bit purple and,88.77,3.27
the tips of the toes I don't have the,90.75,2.85
casein see they're already white a,92.04,4.649
little bit white purple and and this is,93.6,6.96
what we call a critical limb ischemia,96.689,6.091
then this scheme it means no blood flow,100.56,4.99
and that's essentially what's happened,102.78,7.419
[Music],105.55,4.649
so our goal right now is is to continue,111.34,7.51
to maximize our efforts to save the legs,116.3,6.179
okay that's what we're doing and again,118.85,5.28
it gets to a point where because these,122.479,4.381
arteries are so tiny that the blood does,124.13,5.519
just is not flowing to the toes we,126.86,4.8
actually have to do it on the opposite,129.649,4.201
where now we have to move towards the,131.66,4.04
arteries that are a little bit bigger so,133.85,6.78
you know we're here we're here and we're,135.7,7.87
definitely putting a plan on attack that,140.63,5.46
wall we're gonna definitely try to say,143.57,3.93
you know the same saving lives saving,146.09,3.0
lives were here and then up in a,147.5,4.02
situation where it's about life more,149.09,5.73
than anything now so I'll keep you guys,151.52,6.51
afloat on this particular case and like,154.82,5.49
always try to educate the community on,158.03,8.63
what we do thank you for watching,160.31,6.35
