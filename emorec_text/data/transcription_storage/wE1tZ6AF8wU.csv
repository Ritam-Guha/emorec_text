endocrinologist i treat diabetes every,2.96,2.799
day,5.279,2.721
and i am going to answer a common,5.759,3.441
question today,8.0,4.4
which is the symptoms of high blood,9.2,3.76
sugar,12.4,2.56
so what do you feel like when you have,12.96,4.079
high now a lot of people,14.96,4.239
who are dealing with diabetes at some,17.039,3.121
point in their life,19.199,4.0
may have felt that they had the low,20.16,5.039
blood sugar symptoms right so it doesn't,23.199,4.561
feel good it's very easily identifiable,25.199,4.561
but today i'm going to talk to you about,27.76,3.839
high blood sugar symptoms,29.76,4.799
now how do you really know uh that your,31.599,4.401
blood sugars are high now one thing,34.559,3.041
before we jump to that guys make sure,36.0,3.12
you subscribe make sure you give a,37.6,2.08
thumbs up,39.12,2.24
make sure you share this video if you,39.68,4.399
like it now back to the topic guys,41.36,5.28
so a lot of people will sometimes will,44.079,3.681
tell me in my,46.64,3.12
in my clinic they'll be like oh doc i,47.76,3.52
don't take my blood sugar i'm like why,49.76,3.439
they'll be like ah well i can feel it,51.28,5.04
what's your blood sugar right now,53.199,5.441
they'll always be wrong now you know,56.32,3.919
your feelings are not gonna always tell,58.64,2.96
you what your blood sugar is so i,60.239,3.041
wouldn't recommend just by going by your,61.6,2.32
feelings,63.28,3.76
i'm just gonna tell you that if you,63.92,4.879
didn't check your blood sugar and you,67.04,4.0
don't feel right and what symptoms can,68.799,3.201
be related to high,71.04,3.04
blood sugars number one you're going to,72.0,4.08
start going to the bathroom a lot,74.08,4.48
here's why it happens your kidneys can,76.08,4.48
only hold on to sugar so much,78.56,4.879
so after 220 blood sugar in diabetics if,80.56,4.559
your blood sugar is staying above 220,83.439,3.601
for a while you're going to dump the,85.119,3.36
sugar into your bladder,87.04,3.439
and as a result you will end up peeing,88.479,3.921
bunch of sugar and the sugar attracts,90.479,3.6
water so you're going to end up,92.4,4.399
urinating a lot and that's going to make,94.079,3.601
you what,96.799,2.32
thirsty of course so you're gonna,97.68,2.799
urinate a lot you're gonna be thirsty,99.119,2.561
you're gonna drink more water and you're,100.479,2.481
gonna feel like you can drink all the,101.68,2.719
water in the world you'll still be,102.96,2.799
thirsty there's a problem,104.399,3.36
if you don't have diabetes you may have,105.759,3.36
diabetes so you better check your blood,107.759,2.961
sugar or get tested,109.119,3.841
you're going to feel tired as well why,110.72,4.16
because if your body is not using the,112.96,3.6
sugar that's running in your system it's,114.88,2.96
like having a bank account with five,116.56,2.72
million dollars but you cannot pay your,117.84,3.2
rent that's a problem right it's painful,119.28,2.56
it's fatigue,121.04,2.64
it's gonna cause problems and this this,121.84,3.279
your muscle will not be able to get to,123.68,2.32
the glucose,125.119,2.721
and as a result you are going to feel,126.0,3.44
very tired and of course it's going to,127.84,2.96
come with headache as well,129.44,4.159
again your brain runs on the glucose the,130.8,4.159
moment that your being,133.599,3.041
your your brain is unable to get that,134.959,3.521
glucose then you are going to be in,136.64,3.44
trouble and it's going to trigger a,138.48,2.32
headache,140.08,1.92
not just high blood sugars but,140.8,3.04
fluctuations in your blood sugars,142.0,3.68
as well sometimes people will tell me,143.84,3.84
hey if my blood sugar goes down to 110 i,145.68,3.52
have a headache well that's not because,147.68,3.199
110 blood sugar causes a headache,149.2,3.2
it's because they're normally running up,150.879,4.0
to 200 300 and then sudden drop in the,152.4,4.72
blood sugar will definitely trigger a,154.879,4.241
headache as well so fluctuations,157.12,4.24
are definitely a problem now if your,159.12,3.92
blood sugars are also running high,161.36,3.84
your lens in your eyes will swell and,163.04,3.919
you will start having blurry vision,165.2,3.52
so don't think that you're going blind,166.959,3.36
it's totally reversible,168.72,3.2
but you're going to have blurry vision,170.319,3.28
and that's not going to,171.92,4.8
feel right having said that uh if you,173.599,4.401
don't do anything about these symptoms,176.72,2.799
then you continue to ignore yourself and,178.0,3.68
hopefully you don't but if you do,179.519,3.36
you may end up with something like,181.68,4.0
called dka diabetes ketoacidosis now,182.879,4.72
diabetic ketoacidosis typically happens,185.68,3.36
in type 1 patients,187.599,3.92
however type 2 diabetic patients can end,189.04,3.199
up with,191.519,3.041
diabetic ketoacidosis especially if,192.239,4.241
there are certain drugs that can make,194.56,3.12
them prone to it,196.48,3.28
or if they leave their blood sugar,197.68,4.0
staying running high,199.76,5.039
for a prolonged period of time what,201.68,3.68
happens,204.799,3.44
is we call that gluco toxicity which,205.36,4.879
means that the glucose the high glucose,208.239,2.56
levels,210.239,2.961
will basically paralyze your pancreas,210.799,4.401
and your pancreas will stop making,213.2,4.72
insulin so what are the diabetic ketosis,215.2,3.52
or the symptoms,217.92,3.52
you're going to have nausea you're going,218.72,4.159
to have abdominal pain,221.44,5.439
you may vomit and the acidotic state,222.879,7.201
will set in and that's not cool so,226.879,4.0
basically,230.08,3.12
you are going to also have this bad,230.879,4.0
breath that sounds like a,233.2,4.239
spoiled fruit and nobody wants to be,234.879,3.201
around you,237.439,2.961
uh so you're gonna feel weak you may,238.08,3.28
feel confused,240.4,3.119
you may breathe rapidly because your,241.36,3.76
body will try to,243.519,4.161
excrete that excessive acid through,245.12,3.44
breathing,247.68,3.199
okay so these are the main problems,248.56,4.399
associated with diabetes again diabetic,250.879,3.201
ketoacidosis,252.959,4.081
is the advanced like the towards the end,254.08,3.92
stage of,257.04,4.64
uh diabetes uh symptoms uh on that scale,258.0,6.32
but if you are feeling excessive,261.68,3.92
urination if you're having excessive,264.32,3.2
urination if you're feeling thirsty a,265.6,2.64
lot,267.52,3.84
if you're feeling headache weak tired,268.24,6.32
those are the symptoms of,271.36,5.44
high blood sugars definitely blurred,274.56,4.32
vision definitely can be,276.8,5.119
a quick tip for you if you don't feel,278.88,3.759
any of these,281.919,3.201
some people's eyes are very sensitive to,282.639,4.161
glucose changes as well,285.12,4.48
so you may realize the blurry vision,286.8,4.08
faster than some other symptoms,289.6,2.159
sometimes,290.88,3.52
so i hope that was useful guys so please,291.759,4.0
