in our research we had two main aims,9.4,7.16
which was to look at look at how much,11.62,7.06
patients actually are doing in a typical,16.56,4.889
oncology unit kind of like Bedford,18.68,4.8
hospital and secondly to find out,21.449,4.891
whether patients had any concerns or,23.48,4.48
barriers that were limiting the exercise,26.34,4.62
levels of any we used a validated,27.96,4.439
screening tool for exercise known as the,30.96,2.73
general practice physical activity,32.399,3.241
questionnaire which is a very useful,33.69,6.329
tool for kind of objectively giving a,35.64,5.97
categorized and how much exercise,40.019,3.601
patients are actually doing and what we,41.61,3.81
found was that only eleven percent of,43.62,3.329
the patients in our cohort were,45.42,3.75
achieving active levels that means that,46.949,4.021
eighty-nine percent were were,49.17,3.33
insufficiently active and should be,50.97,3.92
advised to do more exercise another,52.5,5.04
aspect data rows more findings was that,54.89,5.37
patients are actually more aware that,57.54,5.04
exercise is good for them so the message,60.26,4.6
has gotten out there I think what we,62.58,4.68
need to do is to now adapt information,64.86,3.99
materials so that they don't focus just,67.26,4.38
on relaying the message that exercise is,68.85,5.43
good for you but also to kind of,71.64,5.67
understand why patients are still not,74.28,4.29
doing enough exercise even though they,77.31,2.879
know this and what we found is that a,78.57,3.96
lot of patients are concerned about,80.189,4.14
doing more exercise because for,82.53,4.019
health-related reasons so because you,84.329,4.32
know cancer patients they deal with a,86.549,3.36
lot of stresses related to their,88.649,3.9
diagnosis and the treatment so they,89.909,4.59
often feel that they're too tired to do,92.549,3.511
exercise there in too much pain to do,94.499,4.11
exercise a lot of patients also feel,96.06,4.68
that they can't schedule exercise into,98.609,6.241
their busy timetables and there is still,100.74,5.82
a subset of patients who are who are,104.85,2.909
where that exercise good for them but,106.56,3.54
are still still not sure still don't,107.759,3.75
realize how much exercise that really,110.1,3.6
requires so 25 percent of the patients,111.509,3.54
at our cohort thought they were ready,113.7,3.209
exercising enough and it turns out that,115.049,3.77
they actually only twenty-five,116.909,3.78
twenty-five percent of these specific,118.819,3.82
patients were actually active on the GP,120.689,4.86
paq so I think what we need to do is,122.639,5.76
adapt information materials so that we,125.549,5.041
now reassure patients that exercise can,128.399,5.221
be and is safe especially if they can be,130.59,4.8
referred to formal exercise programs,133.62,3.21
where they can be supervised by trained,135.39,3.33
professionals and these trained,136.83,4.23
professionals can kind of on Taylor,138.72,4.14
exercise programs and address any,141.06,3.1
individual concerns that,142.86,3.73
might have we think it would also be,144.16,6.15
useful to have expand roles for possibly,146.59,7.08
dedicated a lifestyle and physical,150.31,6.27
activity advisors will be able to sit,153.67,4.5
down with patients go through all the,156.58,3.98
concerns,158.17,2.39
exercise was the main factor we did,163.56,5.19
collect some data on smoking and obesity,166.17,5.73
so sixty-eight percent of our patient,168.75,6.739
cohort were overweight or obese which is,171.9,6.32
obviously also a risk factor for,175.489,5.441
cardiovascular disease and increases the,178.22,5.17
rate of side effects as well so that's,180.93,4.5
another aspect that would be helped with,183.39,4.41
doing more exercise and we did look,185.43,4.86
briefly it's smoking levels so only,187.8,3.719
seven percent of the cohort are,190.29,3.09
currently smoking 52-percent we're,191.519,4.411
ex-smokers so which does suggest that,193.38,4.8
there's a trend towards succeeding in,195.93,6.41
helping patients kind of give up smoking,198.18,4.16
