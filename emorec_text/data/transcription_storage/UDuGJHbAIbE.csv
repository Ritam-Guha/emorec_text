Thank You Teresa,4.43,5.74
and thanks to everyone of you and for,6.45,5.58
the organizer to organize this is a,10.17,4.589
fantastic thing I actually found out,12.03,4.979
this morning that today in Europe,14.759,4.801
they're having a stem-cell day,17.009,4.77
it's called uni stem it's sponsored by,19.56,3.929
unis stem so I think it's quite a,21.779,3.12
coincidence and I think it's nice that,23.489,3.33
we're engaging with the public and,24.899,3.63
university throughout the world,26.819,3.75
discussed this of course I'm a stem cell,28.529,4.44
biologist so I'm gonna argue for the,30.569,7.071
stem cell use of cells or pancreatic,32.969,7.32
cells derived from the embryonic stem,37.64,4.149
cells are pluripotent stem cells to,40.289,4.531
treat type 1 diabetes and as you heard,41.789,6.98
from Derek before in the introduction,44.82,7.289
the current treatment for type 1,48.769,7.47
diabetes is insulin injection either by,52.109,7.68
needles or with pumps which you will,56.239,6.611
hear in the second debate but this,59.789,7.561
treatment is not very efficient because,62.85,8.46
we cannot control in real time the sugar,67.35,6.299
concentration in your blood in the blood,71.31,4.949
and this is the job of the beta cells,73.649,5.211
the beta cells in your pancreas is,76.259,5.911
constantly monitoring the sugar level in,78.86,6.219
your blood and constantly adjusting so,82.17,5.01
if there is too much sugar the beta,85.079,4.5
cells releases insulin insulin is like a,87.18,4.68
message goes to the other organs and say,89.579,3.54
there is too much sugar in your blood,91.86,5.939
take it up so if we can substitute these,93.119,7.371
beta cells there is destroyed in type 1,97.799,6.03
diabetics patients then we can cure the,100.49,5.559
disease and we know we can do this,103.829,4.89
because transplantation of the entire,106.049,5.371
pancreas or the islets as you heard,108.719,4.89
before which are isolated from the,111.42,5.64
pancreas works but it doesn't work for a,113.609,5.82
long time as we heard after five years,117.06,4.979
usually a patient needs to have another,119.429,5.071
transplant of islets unless they receive,122.039,5.551
the whole pancreas which is usually more,124.5,5.22
successful but the problem with that,127.59,3.88
there are two problems with that,129.72,3.91
the first problem is immunosuppressants,131.47,4.08
immunosuppressants are very harsh drugs,133.63,4.08
but you know you don't want to give with,135.55,4.17
to pay to patients with type 1 diabetes,137.71,4.29
it's actually better to be on insulin,139.72,3.93
treatment rather than having,142.0,4.17
immunosuppressants so only patients are,143.65,5.91
really sick and cannot control their,146.17,5.79
blood glucose with insulin injection,149.56,4.74
will be candidate for all pancreas,151.96,4.29
transplantation or islet transplantation,154.3,5.1
the second biggest problem that we have,156.25,5.82
with the transplantation is that we,159.4,5.43
don't have enough donors even if you,162.07,5.34
want to you know if you want a cure even,164.83,5.1
if everybody in the world decides to,167.41,5.79
become a donor after their death we will,169.93,6.06
not have enough patients we would not,173.2,5.49
have enough donors to cure every patient,175.99,6.09
with type 1 diabetes so how are we gonna,178.69,6.11
address this we're gonna generate cells,182.08,5.91
from pure potent stem cells and that,184.8,5.29
will allow us to generate an unlimited,187.99,5.13
source of beta cells that can cure type,190.09,5.52
1 diabetes and we know we can do this,193.12,5.64
and when I say this is because this is,195.61,5.19
not the future this is happening now,198.76,4.62
it's not science fiction we can actually,200.8,3.51
do this,203.38,3.78
every day I do it in the lab not this,204.31,5.13
tower here but on the other side of Mars,207.16,4.59
and if you know if you haven't become,209.44,4.019
interested in science and you want to,211.75,3.84
come and become a summer student in my,213.459,4.291
lab and maybe graduate students I'm here,215.59,5.34
promoting my love you can come and I'll,217.75,5.489
teach you how to do this we we take an,220.93,4.5
embryonic stem cells or an IPS cells,223.239,5.551
which is as dr. Ali apigenin showed you,225.43,6.21
before itself from you any one of you,228.79,4.949
here that I can revert to become,231.64,4.59
embryonic stem cell like and we can,233.739,5.131
convert it into a pancreatic cells and,236.23,6.18
as of last year two groups one in Canada,238.87,5.7
and one in the u.s. showed that we can,242.41,4.53
actually make beta cells in vitro and,244.57,5.01
we've been able to reproduce that so,246.94,5.609
what we're doing now is taking these,249.58,7.469
cells either a cell that can become a,252.549,6.66
pancreatic reject can become a beta,257.049,4.471
cells or in the future a beta cell,259.209,2.981
itself,261.52,3.1
and we can transplant it into patients,262.19,4.11
with type 1 diabetes to cure the disease,264.62,5.58
and again this is not the future this is,266.3,6.27
already happening there is a clinical,270.2,6.74
trial undergoing right now in the States,272.57,7.11
treating patient with this type of cells,276.94,4.96
treating patient with type 1 diabetes,279.68,5.28
with this type of cells and very soon I,281.9,5.85
expect that Canada will launch the same,284.96,5.91
clinical trial the FDA approved the,287.75,6.75
trial in the u.s. and Health Canada has,290.87,7.14
approved the trial in in in Canada it,294.5,5.37
hasn't started yet but I think he's,298.01,4.68
gonna start very soon so you can see how,299.87,5.46
this is not a question of how and,302.69,4.95
whether we're gonna do this we're gonna,305.33,5.1
do it and we're just gonna get better at,307.64,5.91
this and the best you know the the best,310.43,5.58
side of this is that we we're gonna put,313.55,5.28
these cells inside the device imagine,316.01,5.52
this device to be like a tea bag where,318.83,4.23
you're gonna have the cells inside the,321.53,4.14
tea bag they're protected from the,323.06,4.89
immune system that would normally attack,325.67,4.59
the cells but they can sense the sugar,327.95,5.16
coming through the pores of the membrane,330.26,5.55
and can release insulin into the,333.11,5.16
bloodstream so even even if something,335.81,5.91
goes wrong in the preparation that we,338.27,5.97
put into a patient we can figure it out,341.72,5.07
and remove the tea bag from the patient,344.24,4.98
so you know when I heard from Theresa,346.79,4.92
that my opponent was Derrick Vander coy,349.22,5.99
I was a bit scared because he's the,351.71,6.45
hardest person to debate against but as,355.21,5.32
you can see this argument is pretty,358.16,4.77
strong so I'm actually looking forward,360.53,5.7
to hear what he can come up with and you,362.93,7.14
know please stay on my side thank you,366.23,5.52
very much and take questions after,370.07,4.43
Derrick start,371.75,2.75
