well before i came to sequoia health i,0.96,5.439
was struggling with neuropathy i've been,3.76,6.32
a diabetic since uh 2002.,6.399,6.561
neuropathy kind of just snuck up on me,10.08,4.559
over the years one of those things it,12.96,4.239
doesn't go away and it kind of only gets,14.639,5.361
worse but i came here and admittedly,17.199,4.881
it's different than traditional medicine,20.0,4.88
where you go in and get a pill,22.08,4.64
i remember walking back out to my car,24.88,4.319
after my first treatment and i could,26.72,5.6
actually feel the ground under my feet,29.199,5.2
and i don't think i had experienced that,32.32,3.84
for years,34.399,3.201
i didn't even know i was missing it,36.16,4.559
because i i was just gone for so long,37.6,5.44
and i could feel the ground under my,40.719,6.16
feet and i thought wow that is great,43.04,6.48
and it's only improved since then,46.879,5.281
well after my treatment at sequoia i,49.52,5.359
feel like a normal human being i feel,52.16,5.2
like the person i used to be i'd,54.879,4.48
recommend if anybody is thinking about,57.36,5.039
this just to come in keep an open mind,59.359,4.401
just relax,62.399,3.76
and accept the treatment and you're,63.76,5.8
going to feel better,66.159,3.401
