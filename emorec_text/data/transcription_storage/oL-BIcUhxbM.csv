i am talking about traveling with,10.719,6.001
diabetes i have a little guess for you,14.0,6.64
today its name is for all family it's,16.72,7.28
acute cooler for your medicines i'm sure,20.64,5.44
there is a lot of misconception out,24.0,5.519
there for many new or recently diagnosed,26.08,5.84
diabetes with people even for diabetes,29.519,4.88
veterans they might not know this and,31.92,4.159
they may be saying that,34.399,5.361
now i have diabetes my travel ability is,36.079,4.881
limited,39.76,4.16
or i may not take my insulin because i'm,40.96,5.68
traveling or their a1c is high because,43.92,5.28
they're traveling and so forth well,46.64,5.84
that's a myth technology and signs,49.2,6.64
evolve every day and thankfully life,52.48,5.919
with diabetes and other chronic diseases,55.84,6.0
is way less stressful than it used to be,58.399,4.241
yes,61.84,4.639
choosing the correct gears and equipment,62.64,6.72
is a game changer it's very crucial part,66.479,4.721
of the whole equation,69.36,5.04

for all family,74.4,4.8
innovative medicine coolers which i do,76.24,5.68
believe is the solution for traveling,79.2,6.72
with not only for diabetes but with all,81.92,7.12
other sensitive medications that are,85.92,5.76
tailored perfectly to your needs i am,89.04,5.2
talking about this cooler because it,91.68,5.68
seems that they are the most reliable,94.24,5.919
the most versatile and most robust in,97.36,5.36
the market as far as i can see,100.159,4.64
let me explain why also by the way at,102.72,3.759
the end of this video remember to visit,104.799,4.081
the description below to get the special,106.479,4.881
discount that i asked from the,108.88,5.919
manufacturer just for you first of all,111.36,5.28
the story of the brand is very,114.799,2.881
interesting,116.64,3.68
a vacation disaster originally inspired,117.68,5.759
the founders of for all family a friend,120.32,5.759
with type 1 diabetes lost his entire,123.439,5.281
insulin stash when it was spoiled by hot,126.079,5.441
temperatures as a result the company,128.72,5.599
based in albania now builds high,131.52,6.48
capacity coolers designed to withstand,134.319,6.721
the extreme summer conditions i will go,138.0,6.319
over their models and i kept the best,141.04,4.8
one to,144.319,4.081
the last because i want you to keep,145.84,5.759
watching for a complete review and make,148.4,5.36
the best decision if you are planning to,151.599,4.801
buy for all family medicine cooler the,153.76,6.4
classic model works on a dual technology,156.4,7.52
having a biogel ice pack designed not to,160.16,7.2
freeze insulin and a cooling top that,163.92,6.399
runs on usb power the best part is that,167.36,5.36
you can combine both the ice pack and,170.319,5.92
the usb cooling this way you transform,172.72,7.04
your unit into a mini fridge that would,176.239,6.801
keep the fridge temperature at around 36,179.76,7.199
to 45 fahrenheit for 50 hours,183.04,7.04
and room temperature for around 36 to 79,186.959,5.601
fahrenheit for more than 72 hours which,190.08,4.48
is the best in the market,192.56,4.319
thanks to it is dual technology it can,194.56,4.24
be configured into three different,196.879,3.44
cooling methods,198.8,4.56
making it the most versatile solution,200.319,5.601
out there also the unit is not even,203.36,6.0
bulky at all so staying at,205.92,6.48
9 inch tall and only 3.3 inches wide,209.36,5.12
this product is designed in such a way,212.4,4.479
that it can also one of the most,214.48,4.96
spacious in the market as you can see it,216.879,5.28
can keep so many insulin pins and it's,219.44,5.359
very practical to carry around it can be,222.159,4.8
your number one choice for long distance,224.799,3.36
traveling,226.959,4.161
since it can be charged in the car in,228.159,5.44
the trains the airplane and also would,231.12,4.8
be your best friend while camping the,233.599,6.401
better news is that they are constantly,235.92,7.28
innovating upgrading and adding value to,240.0,6.319
the community so as next upgrade this,243.2,7.119
newly upgraded usb lid is very powerful,246.319,7.601
and also has built-in intelligence that,250.319,5.28
would automatically regulate the,253.92,5.12
temperature between 36 to 45 fahrenheit,255.599,7.441
at all the time so the best part is it,259.04,6.719
comes with a temperature display where,263.04,5.2
you can check the temperature in real,265.759,6.16
time giving you that confidence boost,268.24,6.88
that you all need when traveling with,271.919,5.681
expensive diabetes medications,275.12,5.04
this model with temperature control is,277.6,4.879
the brand flex ship model,280.16,5.84
but my favorite part is the models that,282.479,6.961
are interchangeable meaning if you would,286.0,6.479
like to upgrade to a better model you,289.44,6.319
simply get delete separately without,292.479,5.841
getting a whole new unit,295.759,5.601
having such options in just one unit,298.32,5.92
would allow you to perfectly optimize,301.36,5.839
your travel configuration tailored to,304.24,4.239
your needs,307.199,4.401
