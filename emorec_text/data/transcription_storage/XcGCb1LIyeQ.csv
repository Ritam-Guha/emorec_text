the next question is about nerve,0.979,5.53
supplements there are some nutritional,3.21,5.49
supplements that are that advise my,6.509,3.541
patients to take when they're dealing,8.7,4.83
with entrapments of the nerves and their,10.05,6.059
extremities I treat only the upper,13.53,4.499
extremity but I think that could,16.109,4.411
probably apply in other parts of the,18.029,5.191
body what I advise them to take is,20.52,8.339
magnesium vitamin b-complex so all the B,23.22,8.43
vitamins not just the b6 to the b12 but,28.859,9.27
all of them coenzyme q10 alpha lipoic,31.65,13.889
acid and a settle carnitine so those are,38.129,8.7
the ones the primary ones I recommend,45.539,4.321
and I would advise that patients take,46.829,8.491
those before during and after surgery no,49.86,9.269
one knows how long and you know I always,55.32,5.489
make sure that the patients speak to,59.129,3.151
their pharmacist to make sure there's no,60.809,3.57
funny business happening with the,62.28,5.28
medication or any diseases that they may,64.379,7.831
have there's limited data on the subject,67.56,7.52
but there's some animal studies showing,72.21,7.38
benefits with respect to nerve recovery,75.08,9.64
nerve pain it's been used in patients,79.59,9.0
with neuropathy including diabetic,84.72,5.88
neuropathy and it's been quite active,88.59,5.31
and effective with pain and tingling and,90.6,5.67
numbness and such things so I think it,93.9,3.96
just makes sense to support nerve,96.27,6.98
healing after decompressing the nerve,97.86,5.39
