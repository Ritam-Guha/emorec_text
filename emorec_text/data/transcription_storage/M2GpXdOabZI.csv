the ACIP has just made a new,8.42,4.929
recommendation for the use of hepatitis,11.16,5.82
B vaccine in diabetic adults and the,13.349,6.6
focus is on adults under 60 years of age,16.98,4.86
and whom the vaccine is most effective,19.949,5.131
and most cost-effective and so all,21.84,5.849
adults under 60 who have diabetes are,25.08,4.859
now recommended to receive the,27.689,4.771
three-dose hepatitis B vaccine series,29.939,5.931
for adults 60 years of age and above,32.46,5.34
physicians need to take into,35.87,4.24
consideration the risk of exposure and,37.8,6.06
the primary risk that we know is present,40.11,7.26
is adults who live in assisted living or,43.86,5.64
skilled nursing facilities who have,47.37,4.439
assisted blood glucose monitoring,49.5,4.949
occurring very frequently and those,51.809,5.73
adults are at increased risk to get,54.449,5.571
hepatitis B and for them we would also,57.539,5.25
encourage physicians to consider a,60.02,4.929
recommendation for vaccination on a,62.789,5.58
case-by-case basis what this means is,64.949,5.131
there's a new group of physicians who,68.369,3.871
need to be thinking about hepatitis B,70.08,5.91
vaccine and make sure that they have,72.24,5.699
vaccine on hand to give to their,75.99,5.1
diabetic patients we do know from the,77.939,6.061
data that we reviewed that diabetic,81.09,4.44
patients are generally in their,84.0,3.57
physician offices quite frequently,85.53,4.949
during the year at routine visits and,87.57,5.13
follow-up visits for their diabetic care,90.479,4.261
so we don't think an extra visit is,92.7,4.559
going to be necessary for this and when,94.74,4.62
you're diabetic patients come in for,97.259,4.301
routine checks or in the,99.36,4.48
diabetes clinic or endocrinologist,101.56,5.43
clinic that that's a good opportunity to,103.84,5.93
consider immunizing and so,106.99,5.22
endocrinologists have a new vaccine to,109.77,4.419
consider they should already be giving,112.21,5.31
influenza vaccine do their patients but,114.189,6.421
now we've added hepatitis B vaccine is,117.52,5.519
another vaccine for their particular,120.61,5.81
patient population,123.039,3.381
you,152.36,2.06
