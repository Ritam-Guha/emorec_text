hey this is dr. Barry let's talk for,0.03,4.019
just a few minutes about something,2.669,3.601
called a tenth assist nigricans,4.049,4.59
what the heck is that if I have it what,6.27,4.38
does it mean is it a big deal or not,8.639,4.551
this is actually a very important,10.65,6.99
medical sign it's a red flag for serious,13.19,6.61
disease and I'm gonna describe what this,17.64,4.44
is to you and I'm gonna tell you what,19.8,4.95
you should do about this okay first of,22.08,4.35
all if you know someone who has dark,24.75,4.73
velvety patches of kind of raised,26.43,6.42
leathery feeling velvety feeling skin on,29.48,6.13
their neck under their armpits in their,32.85,4.83
groin even around their navel sometimes,35.61,4.5
rarely on the face then please share,37.68,4.23
this video with them they need to know,40.11,3.359
that that's actually a risk factor for,41.91,4.739
very serious medical issues and you're,43.469,5.43
sharing this could save them lots of,46.649,4.171
suffering and maybe even save their life,48.899,4.111
now let's talk about a can ptosis,50.82,4.71
nigricans what the heck is it and what,53.01,5.16
should you do so as we've said it's a,55.53,5.16
it's a thickening of velvety darkness in,58.17,4.86
the skin and there are five different,60.69,3.929
types and I'm gonna go through each,63.03,3.15
different type and tell you kind of what,64.619,3.54
causes that and what if anything you can,66.18,4.56
do about it but some you can do stuff,68.159,6.841
about some you cannot so this is the one,70.74,6.09
that either there are severe medical,75.0,4.049
issues that can cause this and so you,76.83,4.89
need to know about this okay now type 1,79.049,5.341
is familial which means you inherit it,81.72,4.35
you can inherit this from your mom or,84.39,3.33
dad or it may be even skips a generation,86.07,4.56
but you can get it genetically okay and,87.72,4.71
that's usually a very mild case you'll,90.63,4.199
be able to see it faintly on your neck,92.43,4.439
or in your armpits maybe you're growing,94.829,5.341
but it's not very noticeable from a,96.869,4.981
distance people who are not medically,100.17,3.3
educated you usually won't even know it,101.85,2.85
they'll just think you've got darker,103.47,3.42
skin there and it's usually not a sign,104.7,4.379
of anything bad or serious but the,106.89,3.839
problem is is you don't know if you have,109.079,4.68
type 1 or familial or if you have one of,110.729,5.551
the other four types now type 2 is,113.759,6.75
caused by endocrine problems okay these,116.28,6.18
are the glands in your body that secrete,120.509,3.72
different hormones almost without,122.46,4.38
exception it's caused by insulin,124.229,4.95
resistance okay if you have an,126.84,4.53
overabundance of insulin in your system,129.179,4.231
from eating too many carbs they,131.37,4.94
you can develop an endocrine or type-2 a,133.41,7.77
can ptosis nigricans type 3 is obesity,136.31,7.3
now again caused by insulin resistance,141.18,4.26
caused by an overabundance of insulin,143.61,3.75
and glucose in your system and it can,145.44,4.53
lead to these dark patches and so that,147.36,6.03
is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome,149.97,4.95
if you have a cognate Ken ptosis,153.39,3.33
nigricans you're at increased risk for,154.92,4.5
PCOS for dementia for metabolic syndrome,156.72,5.58
for type 2 diabetes in fact a lot of,159.42,4.38
people that's how their diabetes is,162.3,3.24
diagnosed is they have these dark,163.8,3.14
patches and they go to a dermatologist,165.54,3.75
and he says oh you know what let's check,166.94,4.66
a blood sugar and a fasting insulin,169.29,4.49
level and a c-peptide and sure enough,171.6,4.95
there you go you got type 2 diabetes and,173.78,4.75
you didn't even know it hey Ken thoses,176.55,5.07
nigricans can be the kind of red flag,178.53,4.8
that lets you know that something's,181.62,5.1
wrong type 4 can be is caused by drugs,183.33,5.28
different drugs the most common of which,186.72,4.53
are the steroids the corticosteroids,188.61,4.14
like prednisone medrol,191.25,4.02
methylprednisolone all of those kind of,192.75,4.11
guys if you take high doses for long,195.27,4.56
periods of time can lead to a can ptosis,196.86,6.12
nigricans and so basically again that's,199.83,5.75
because they cause chronically elevated,202.98,5.67
insulin and blood sugar right also if,205.58,5.65
you take super high doses of niacin it,208.65,5.94
can cause a in or a can ptosis nigricans,211.23,6.54
also if you take oral contraceptives,214.59,5.76
they can sometimes rarely lead to this,217.77,6.0
condition okay now type 5 very very,220.35,6.06
important a can ptosis nigricans can,223.77,5.85
also be a red flag for cancer yeah,226.41,5.85
malignancy can lead to these dark,229.62,5.19
velvety patches on your neck or under,232.26,4.29
your arms or in your growing sometimes,234.81,3.39
rarely around the navel or even on the,236.55,3.93
face but usually it's the neck and the,238.2,5.52
armpits is where it shows up and so if,240.48,4.83
you have any cancer of the,243.72,3.63
gastrointestinal system the stomach the,245.31,4.56
liver the pancreas that can cause a can,247.35,4.41
ptosis nigricans if you have,249.87,5.04
genitourinary bladder kidneys ureters,251.76,5.61
that can also lead to it if you have any,254.91,4.949
of the gynecological cancers ovarian,257.37,5.16
fallopian tube uterine that can also,259.859,5.581
lead to a can ptosis nigricans so if you,262.53,4.47
have these dark patches,265.44,3.63
you've got to go see your doctor and you,267.0,4.5
need to be checked for metabolic disease,269.07,4.59
chronically elevated insulin type 2,271.5,5.25
diabetes pre-diabetes insulin resistance,273.66,6.96
and you also if it comes on suddenly if,276.75,5.34
you're not taking any of the drugs I,280.62,3.72
mentioned in type 4 then you need to be,282.09,5.64
really scanned for cancer okay,284.34,6.75
a can thoses nigricans a big deal and so,287.73,5.19
if you have a friend or a family member,291.09,3.27
of you're like oh yeah they do have,292.92,3.44
those those velvety dark brown patches,294.36,4.47
that's a big deal they need to see their,296.36,4.24
doctor and be thoroughly evaluated,298.83,5.37
either for insulin resistance disordered,300.6,6.3
insulin glucose metabolism or cancer,304.2,4.89
