here the stay Mia McNamara global,0.0,3.75
medical news network at the skin disease,1.709,3.9
Education Foundation women's and,3.75,3.629
pediatric dermatology seminar in San,5.609,4.2
Francisco and with me is dr. Jeffrey P,7.379,3.93
Callen of the University of Louisville,9.809,4.74
in Kentucky my first question is how did,11.309,4.711
you learn about the growing connection,14.549,3.691
between insulin resistance and they,16.02,3.63
can't doses in Agra can that you're,18.24,3.99
talking about during a presentation and,19.65,4.08
it was clear that there were patients,22.23,4.74
who had a can ptosis narcan's that was,23.73,6.33
seemingly not related to any measurable,26.97,5.789
endocrine appa the-- other than their,30.06,5.58
being overweight and at that time in the,32.759,5.341
mid seventies it was called pseudo,35.64,5.579
acanthosis nigricans subsequently it's,38.1,4.889
been recognized that most of the,41.219,5.391
patients who had that entity would also,42.989,6.331
be when tested would be able to,46.61,4.09
demonstrate that they had insulin,49.32,4.2
resistance and so probably their insulin,50.7,5.73
resistance was also related to the to a,53.52,6.03
reason for them being obese and then on,56.43,5.519
top of it it allowed them to get a can't,59.55,5.009
doses nagger cans so is this connection,61.949,5.551
widely known among dermatologists well,64.559,4.531
it's yeah I've been talking about it for,67.5,3.6
probably the last four or five years so,69.09,3.72
I would hope so you know what the number,71.1,4.32
of meetings I go to but I think it,72.81,4.62
sometimes is a very subtle finding when,75.42,4.199
you're doing an examination particularly,77.43,5.97
in in the the case that I was going to,79.619,5.581
use to introduce the subject was a young,83.4,4.829
woman who was being seen for acne who's,85.2,5.43
overweight she has really had no,88.229,4.951
menstrual irregularities but she,90.63,4.739
probably does have polycystic ovarian,93.18,5.31
syndrome which is also related to the,95.369,7.521
presence of insulin resistance and and,98.49,6.419
basically the reason that we were,102.89,3.369
alerted to the fact that she was,104.909,3.75
probably insulin resistant was that,106.259,4.711
doing her complete examination we,108.659,5.1
noticed a velvety discoloration on the,110.97,4.89
back of her neck and folded area of the,113.759,3.9
skin and so made the diagnosis of a,115.86,4.049
cantos entire kans learner in her,117.659,6.24
physician that this was a possibility,119.909,6.541
she was tested I don't think that we as,123.899,3.75
dermatologists though we're going to be,126.45,2.46
treating the patients I think we're,127.649,3.271
going to alert the patient and the fan,128.91,6.06
and then alert the primary care,130.92,6.81
providers whether it's a pediatrician or,134.97,4.62
whether it's a adolescent medicine,137.73,4.26
physician or an internist or a family,139.59,5.22
physician that they ought to do the,141.99,4.23
appropriate testing kind of your,144.81,2.91
take-home message about this what you,146.22,2.91
would tell the dermatologist,147.72,3.48
when looking for this I mean they're,149.13,3.84
obviously going to see they can't focus,151.2,3.99
agra cans maybe they would be the ones,152.97,3.63
who see that and then they would refer,155.19,3.63
them possibly to someone else to manage,156.6,3.96
insulin resistance is that true of those,158.82,3.45
both ways yeah I think so I mean,160.56,4.74
somebody may the patient may be sent,162.27,5.13
because people either they may come,165.3,3.36
rather than may be sent because they've,167.4,2.91
noticed this hyper pigmentation and,168.66,3.24
folded areas of the skin whether the,170.31,4.64
back of the neck under the arms and then,171.9,7.02
us making a proprietary clinical,174.95,5.23
diagnosis you don't really need to do,178.92,4.5
histopathology and then alerting the,180.18,5.37
physician to do the appropriate testing,183.42,4.59
including testing for insulin resistance,185.55,4.77
but for other endocrine disorders this,188.01,3.81
