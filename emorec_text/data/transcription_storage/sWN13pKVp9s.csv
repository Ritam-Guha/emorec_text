"Hello, my name's Hertling",21.258,1.888
and I'm a soldier and,23.146,1.34
-- you probably could tell that.,24.486,2.49
I've been in the military for 38 years.,26.976,2.45
I'm thinking of making it a career.,29.426,1.385
I have seen -- (Laughter) --,30.811,1.888
I have seen and studied and analysed,32.699,2.879
all types of security threats.,35.578,2.48
I've fought in several wars,38.058,1.653
"but there's an emerging threat
that we're seeing",39.711,3.368
"and I'd like to talk a little bit
about today",43.079,2.374
"that I think will have an effect
on our future,",45.453,4.173
"our economy,",49.626,1.81
our youth,51.436,2.079
and our economic system.,53.515,2.59
It is an emerging threat,56.105,1.867
that concerns me significantly,57.972,2.706
and it's represented in this picture.,60.678,3.63
"Now you might think,",64.308,1.108
why is a soldier talking about,65.416,1.832
a young man who is obviously inactive,67.248,3.977
and perhaps is a little bit overweight?,71.225,2.514
And it's because of some things I've seen,73.739,2.788
in the last several years,76.527,1.917
and I'd like to talk a little bit about those today,78.444,2.38
and related to how I believe,80.824,1.802
it could be a national security threat,82.626,1.851
within the next 20 to 30 years.,84.477,2.493
"First of all, in 1983,",86.97,3.343
the Army sent me on something,90.313,1.673
called a broadening experience.,91.986,1.616
I was asked to go graduate school,93.602,2.194
at Indiana University.,95.796,1.207
"I had studied as an undergraduate 
in International Relations",97.003,2.779
"but they said, ""Hey we want you to go",99.782,1.715
"and get a Master's degree
in Exercise Physiology",101.497,3.794
"and then teach PE at West Point.""",105.291,3.045
"So I said, ""Okay, sounds like a great idea.",108.336,1.64
"It's broadening to be sure.""",109.976,2.052
And I went out there -- (Laugther) --,112.028,2.364
I went to Indiana University,114.392,1.522
and my first class was an anatomy class,115.914,2.776
and I had an anatomy lab.,118.69,1.601
I walked into the classroom,120.291,1.656
and they issued me a cadaver.,121.947,2.677
As they did everyone else in the class.,124.624,1.88
"And the cadaver I had,
came with a medical history",126.504,3.677
"The professor told us,
""In order to respect",130.181,2.548
"the people who have given
their bodies to science",132.729,2.662
"we'd ask you to respect them,
too, and you perhaps",135.391,2.334
wanna name them to remind yourself,137.725,2.48
that they were once a person,140.205,1.045
"although we don't wanna give you
their real name.""",141.25,1.715
So I named mine Charlie.,142.965,2.024
Charlie had a medical history.,144.989,1.217
He had been a two-pack-a-day smoker.,146.206,3.043
Charlie had not exercised in the last 20 years.,149.299,3.986
Charlie was extremely overweight,153.285,2.51
and Charlie had died of a cardiovascular disease,155.795,3.845
and he was 46 years old.,159.64,2.913
"When we pulled him up and we began,",162.553,1.473
the various students in the room began,164.026,1.715
our disection of these bodies,165.741,1.716
I had a lot of a tougher time,167.457,1.97
than some of the other students,169.427,1.561
because I had to cut through,170.988,1.51
several layers of adipose.,172.498,1.746
When I got to the internal body cavities,174.244,1.579
it was amazing to me,175.823,1.417
comparing Charlie's organs,177.24,1.758
"to some of the organs of 
the other students in the class.",178.998,2.452
The heart was surrounded by fat,181.45,2.888
several inches.,184.338,0.982
"One of the tricks our instructors taught us was,",185.32,2.617
"you know, we had to through these labs",187.937,2.177
where we had to name what vein was which,190.114,2.005
"and what artery was which,",192.119,1.962
"and the professor said, ""If you pull",194.081,2.319
"on an artery, it's like a rubber band.",196.4,1.643
"If you pull on a vein, it's like 
a guitar string and it'll twang.""",198.043,2.701
When I pulled on Charlie's arteries and veins,200.744,2.058
they broke off into my hand.,202.802,2.929
So I finished grad school,206.607,2.241
and went to teach at West Point for 3 years,208.848,1.637
from '83 to '86,210.485,1.544
and then after that assignment,212.029,1.502
I went back to the operational Army,213.531,1.522
and did things that all soldiers do:,215.053,2.246
"commanded organizations,",217.3,1.317
"trained, went into combat several times,",218.617,2.414
and then coming out of combat,221.031,1.706
as a Division Commander in 2009,222.737,3.756
the Army decided they wanted to promote me,226.493,2.481
to three-star General,228.974,1.185
I think because they wanted to prove,230.159,1.584
they have a sense of humor.,231.743,1.472
They then sent me to be the Commander of,233.215,2.894
Initial Military Training.,236.109,2.343
"My job was to train
the 160,000 or so soldiers",238.452,4.577
"or correction: civilians,",243.029,1.947
that would come into the Army every year,244.976,1.565
and turn them into soldiers.,246.541,2.478
What I found when I reported to that assignment,249.019,3.585
disturbed me.,252.604,1.579
Several facts came to my attention.,254.183,1.801
"First of all, 75% or more",255.984,4.36
a little bit more actually,260.344,1.197
of the civilians who wanted to join the Army,261.541,3.441
were not qualified to do so.,264.982,2.91
"75% of the 17-24 year olds 
who wanted to join the Army",267.892,3.992
were not qualified,271.884,1.381
and the number one reason,273.265,1.017
was because they were obese.,274.282,2.234
Of the 25% that could join the Army,276.516,2.48
what we found on the first day of basic training,278.996,2.335
was that about 60% of them,281.331,2.93
could not pass the PT test,284.261,3.11
that we gave on the first day.,287.371,1.686
"And that was: 
one minute of push-ups,",289.057,2.052
"one minute of sit-ups and
a one-mile run.",291.109,2.542
"Now, that's not a difficult test.",293.654,2.038
But we were finding that,295.692,1.254
a great majority of our new soldiers,296.946,2.307
"coming off the civilian environment,",299.253,1.967
could not pass that test.,301.22,2.648
I couldn't understand what had happened.,303.868,1.776
This was not what I had left,305.644,2.382
studying physical education in 1986.,308.026,4.341
As we did some analyses,312.367,1.367
I realized that a couple of things had changed.,313.734,3.323
"First of all, number one
and the primary reason was",317.057,3.74
starting in the late '90s,320.797,1.23
"the majority of our elementary
and high schools",322.027,2.169
"stopped teaching PE,",324.196,3.076
"and in fact, only five states",327.272,2.199
of the 50 of our country right now,329.471,2.689
"have mandatory requirements
for physical education",332.16,2.528
between K and 12th grade today.,334.688,3.059
Five out of 50.,337.747,2.273
"Now, you say,
""Okay, well that's interesting,",340.02,2.253
"but what does the Army care about that?""",342.273,2.468
"Well, we're getting the product of that",344.741,1.933
but in addition to second and third order effects,346.674,2.204
were young people that were joining our service,348.878,2.215
"could not run, dodge, jump, tumble, roll",351.093,2.757
the kinds of things you expect soldiers to do,353.85,2.98
if they're in combat.,356.83,1.409
The second thing we found,358.239,2.146
or that I found or realized was,360.385,1.991
that our diet had changed radically,362.376,2.884
in the last 15 years.,365.26,1.905
We were supersizing everything.,367.165,2.72
"Having been stationed overseas in Germany,",369.885,1.745
"that's not the case there,",371.63,1.433
but they were supersizing --,373.063,1.502
if you want a large fries,374.565,0.98
"you can get extra large
and extra-extra large.",375.545,2.288
"You couldn't just get a 16 oz drink,",377.833,1.478
"you could get a 24, 42, 64 oz soda.",379.311,3.582
And that was having a deleterious effect.,382.893,3.021
It was fascinating to me,385.914,1.764
"that we were also seeing,",387.678,2.333
"a scientist told me,",390.011,1.695
that in the last 15 years,391.706,1.535
from the time I left West Point until today,393.241,2.354
Americans eat about 30% more calories a day,395.595,3.37
than they had in 1983,398.965,1.538
and about 15 lbs more of sugar a year.,400.503,4.013
Phenomenal statistics.,404.516,1.823
"But the combination
of a lack of physical education",406.339,3.041
and an increase of poor nutrition,409.38,3.458
was causing secondary effects.,412.838,2.249
"This is the ""O"" food group, by the way.",415.087,2.508
"I started calling it the ""O"" food group",417.595,3.238
"because anything that ends in an ""O""",420.833,1.923
is probably not good for you.,422.756,2.767
(Laugther),425.523,4.415
"I haven't found anything
that ended in ""O"" yet",429.967,2.923
that was actually very nutritious in nature.,432.89,3.591
But what we started to do was,436.481,1.749
we saw some second and third order effects,438.23,1.614
and this is one of them,439.844,1.847
this is at one of our training bases,441.691,2.17
and we have five in the United States Army.,443.861,2.489
We were seeing a malady called,446.35,2.094
"femoral neck stress injuries,",448.444,3.3
and what that means is that,451.744,1.175
the tip of the pelvis would crack,452.919,3.122
and it wouldn't be a clean break,456.041,1.85
but it would be a stress fracture,457.891,1.755
that would cause significant problems,459.646,1.585
"and you can see starting in 2000
that we were beginning to see this",461.231,4.264
"and this is because the people 
we were recruiting were just coming of age",465.495,3.889
and many of them had not had PE,469.384,2.294
and they had started to have the bad nutrition.,471.678,2.41
But by 2009 when our new recruits,474.088,2.959
were 18 or 19 years old,477.047,1.612
they had gone through their entire life,478.659,2.231
"without having a PE class
and dependent on bad nutrition.",480.902,3.191
Those 135 that we had at one training base,484.093,3.847
are significant injuries because,487.94,1.58
in order to fix it,489.52,1.649
"it costs anywhere between 
USD 100,000 and USD 300,000.",491.169,4.658
So this is an economic issue.,495.827,1.626
This isn't just a soldier health issue.,497.453,1.642
For me this was an economic issue.,499.095,3.997
"The third reason, and I'll say this",504.0,1.819
then move quickly on.,505.819,1.534
The third reason we saw,507.353,0.963
was an increase in technology.,508.316,1.936
"Now, I'm a big fan of technology,",510.252,1.429
but the researchers had told me,511.681,1.941
that we now watch as a nation,513.622,1.643
about 150 hours of television a month.,515.265,3.238
That's five hours a day.,518.503,1.962
"In 2009, when we started this study",520.465,2.368
"we were seeing anywhere
from 30 to 40 on average",522.833,3.436
hours of internet searches,526.269,2.625
by adult male Americans per month.,528.894,4.681
That's between one and two hours a day.,533.575,2.725
Gaming was off the charts.,536.3,1.417
"In 2009, and it's increased since then",537.717,2.483
the average teenager was playing,540.2,1.913
thirteen hours of video games per week.,542.113,3.407
Now all those hours in front of a tube,545.52,2.926
were replacing the play time,548.446,1.78
and that's significant.,550.226,2.568
"In addition to that,",552.794,1.182
"the final one, number four:",553.976,2.745
We're terrible examples to our children.,556.721,2.941
We're in too much of a rush.,559.662,1.819
We're eating poorly,561.481,1.449
we're eating fast foods,562.93,1.919
"we're relaxing in front of the television
at the end of the day.",564.849,2.816
We also are relying on technology,567.667,2.32
instead of play,569.987,1.214
and we're not balancing our lives.,571.201,2.318
My wife has a stitchery in our house,573.519,1.657
as we've raised two children,575.176,2.673
and now a couple of grandchildren,577.849,1.422
"that says, ""Your children are watching you.""",579.271,3.056
"What you do speaks louder
than anything you can say.",582.327,3.367
"We were not doing the right things
for our children.",585.694,3.991
So in typical army fashion,589.685,2.064
"I said, ""We've got to address 
these issues with our new recruits.""",591.749,2.91
And we changed several things.,594.659,1.732
We began something we called,596.391,1.897
the Soldier Athlete Initiative,598.288,1.997
"because you can't just say
to a bunch of 18 year olds,",600.285,2.069
"""We're going to get you all in shape",602.354,1.288
"and stop feeding you cheeseburgers.""",603.642,1.98
You have to give kind of a sexy title,605.622,2.377
to it so we called it,607.999,1.316
Soldier Athlete Initiative.,609.315,3.083
"If you're going to perform on the battle field,",612.398,1.512
you have got to train like a champion.,613.91,2.601
"And what we did was,
we completely changed",616.511,1.962
"well, it's a three-legged stool",618.477,1.528
"we completely changed the way
we were training",620.005,2.332
"to compensate for things
that were not going on",622.337,2.579
in grade school and high school.,624.916,2.102
We assigned physical terapists,627.018,2.432
"and athletic trainers
to every organization",629.45,3.049
"because we wanted
to prevent the injuries",632.499,1.743
and treat them before they turned into,634.242,1.715
"those USD 100,000 bone stress fractures.",635.957,4.504
"We wanted to fix them
as they became visible.",640.461,3.72
"And then the third thing
and probably the most important was",644.181,2.656
"we changed the way
we feed food in the mess halls",646.837,3.07
the dining facilities.,649.907,1.253
"We called it ""Fueling the Soldier.""",651.16,1.771
"You can't just say,
""Hey, have a salad.""",652.931,2.216
We instead say -- (Laugther) --,655.147,3.457
you've got to advertise with soldiers,658.604,1.931
"so we said,
""Hey, we're going to fuel you",660.535,2.065
"for maximum performance.""",662.6,1.553
This is what sports teams are doing.,664.153,2.899
"This is what NFL, major league baseball",667.052,1.934
they know they've got to eat right,668.986,1.542
in order to perform at their maximum.,670.528,3.134
"Okay, I'm not going to dwell...",673.662,1.69
"Within the first year, we saw",675.352,2.379
some unbelievably strong statistics,677.731,2.866
that shows this was working:,680.597,1.424
"reduction in injuries,",682.021,1.599
we saved about USD 30 million the first year,683.62,3.061
just in treatment of injuries.,686.681,1.665
30 million in the army.,688.346,2.572
Just on injury prevention,690.918,2.068
And we began to see weight loss,692.986,2.34
"and improved... or we reduced
the number of",695.326,3.222
overweight soldiers we have in the Army.,698.548,1.656
We still have a way to go.,700.204,1.394
"We've advanced this ""Fueling the Soldier""",701.598,1.706
"to ""Fueling the Teams""",703.304,1.981
and in fact we've redirected,705.285,1.318
to the Department of Defense Schools,706.603,1.404
"for our young people
and we're calling it",708.007,2.066
"""Fueling the future.""",710.073,2.951
"So we fixed it!
Or we're on our way to fix it.",713.039,3.068
What's interesting about this,716.107,1.607
"is your Army combined with your Navy,
your Marine Corps",717.714,5.073
you Air Force and your Coast Guard,722.787,1.623
"makes up less than 1%
of the American population.",724.41,5.456
So my concern is:,729.866,2.187
What's going on with the other 99%?,732.053,4.098
And this gets me back to my issue of this,736.151,2.365
being a national security concern.,738.516,2.651
I'm going to show you,741.167,1.698
one area and that's just levels of obesity.,742.865,1.983
This was a chart that represents,744.848,2.598
the number of states in the Union,747.446,1.551
that were below 20% obesity rates,748.997,4.179
on average from a child of 14 to 19 years old.,753.176,3.997
This was in 1985.,757.173,2.242
Watch what happens.,759.415,2.232
As you can see,775.357,1.737
"in 2009, it's significantly worse.",777.094,4.508
The predictions for 2030,781.602,3.821
are these:,785.423,1.761
You can see the number of states,788.461,1.702
that have greater than 65% children obese.,790.163,4.204
"This is not overweight, this is obese.",794.367,3.618
"Now, the related issues",797.985,1.291
that I told you the issue with our injury rates,799.276,1.653
and how much we were paying to fix people,800.929,2.113
is significant.,803.042,1.699
We spend estimated,804.741,1.471
the Department of Health and Education,806.212,1.942
both determined that we spend,808.154,1.992
"on average today between 
USD 150 to USD 200 billion per year",810.146,6.154
treating the results of childhood obesity.,816.3,3.902
We're seeing an increase in diabetes.,820.202,2.249
We estimate that we will have,822.451,1.39
"a 40% cardiovascular disease rate
by the year 2030.",823.841,4.362
This is significant.,828.203,1.532
This is a health care issue.,829.735,3.171
An economic issue.,832.906,1.556
A readiness issue for me because,834.462,2.129
I've seen my pool of recruits deplete,836.591,2.572
based on this.,839.163,1.4
I can't pull them in in order to fix them.,840.563,2.603
And it's just a competition issue.,843.166,2.847
"There's other studies
that show what obesity",846.013,2.375
and lack of activity do to young people.,848.388,2.969
So I believe this is certainly,851.357,2.975
a national security concern.,854.332,2.533
"There are several organizations
who are attempting to approach this.",856.865,3.094
"You may have heard of
Mayor Bloomberg in New York",859.964,3.155
who has banned all sugary drinks,863.119,2.508
"above 16 oz in schools and public restaurants
in New York City",865.627,4.019
and he took a lot of heat for that.,869.646,2.516
"Nike, Blue Cross Blue Shield and Subway",872.162,4.297
are all using overweight actors in their adds,876.459,2.56
to pattern behavior,879.019,2.174
and perhaps to turn this thing around.,881.193,2.088
"Nickelodeon in last year's
Worldwide Day of Play",883.281,2.755
decided to put their screens black,886.036,2.162
as opposed to showing programming,888.198,2.187
in order to get children outside and play.,890.385,2.041
And of course our First Lady,892.426,1.134
over the last several years,893.56,1.772
"has been attempting to do ""Let's Move!""",895.332,2.617
and the counter obesity measures.,897.949,2.317
This concerns me.,900.266,2.255
This concerns me greatly.,902.521,1.643
Again as I said,904.164,2.361
"my name is Hertling,
I am a soldier.",906.525,2.441
I've been a soldier for 38 years.,909.196,2.391
This is not something the Army can fix.,912.326,3.517
"This is not something you can put
a yellow ribbon on",915.843,2.087
"and say, ""Let somebody else take care of it"".",917.93,2.975
This is not something,920.905,1.355
that we can rely on governments,922.26,1.846
or organizations to do.,924.106,2.039
Be fearless in terms of writing your schools.,926.145,2.548
Be fearless in trying to get nutrition,928.693,2.389
back in restaurants.,931.082,1.496
Be fearless in balancing your lives,932.578,2.512
and getting out to exercise.,935.09,1.771
Be fearless in modelling your behavior,936.861,2.183
for young people.,939.044,2.365
That will prevent,942.256,1.473
a whole lot of Charlies in the future.,943.729,2.786
Thank you very much.,946.515,1.297
(Applause),947.812,2.229
