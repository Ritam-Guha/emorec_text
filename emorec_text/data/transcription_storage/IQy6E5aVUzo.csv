- Hello.,0.55,0.833
I am Doctor Torrence.,1.383,0.833
"A Podiatry Fellow at the
University of Michigan.",2.216,2.274
Two of the goals at Michigan Podiatry,4.49,1.78
are to prevent diabetic foot ulcers,6.27,2.18
and diabetic foot amputations.,8.45,2.13
I am going to discuss diabetic foot ulcers,10.58,2.19
and what to do if you develop one.,12.77,2.17
"Remember everything I share
is only for your information.",14.94,3.54
Before making any medical decisions,18.48,1.81
"you should talk to a
healthcare professional first.",20.29,2.74
"An ulcer or wound is a break
in the skin as seen here.",23.03,4.59
The main reasons people with diabetics,27.62,1.9
develop foot ulcers are,30.371,1.029
"lost of feeling in the foot,",31.4,1.532
"poor blood flow to the
foot, increase pressure,",32.932,3.668
or direct injury to the foot.,36.6,2.11
"Diabetic foot ulcers have
a high risk of infection.",38.71,3.19
"Especially if you have had
one for a long period of time.",41.9,2.87
"The infection can spread
from the wound to the bone.",44.77,3.33
"There are antibiotics that
can treat bone infection",48.1,2.46
"however if the infection
destroys to much bone,",50.56,3.32
"the bone will need too
be removed or amputated",53.88,2.46
to promote better healing and provide,56.34,1.93
a better functioning foot.,58.27,1.5
If you develop a diabetic foot ulcer,59.77,2.23
"contact your podiatrist
or healthcare provider",62.0,2.53
right away so that they can develop,64.53,1.55
a treatment plan for you.,66.08,1.91
Your treatment plan will include,67.99,1.39
"blood work, x-ray or MRI.",69.38,2.6
Your provider will also show you,71.98,2.054
how to dress or cover your wound,74.034,1.176
"and how to offload your
wound for better healing.",75.21,3.26
Offloading means reducing pressure,78.47,1.94
"and friction to the
wound for better healing.",80.41,2.6
"Offloading can be done
through a total contact cast",83.01,3.15
as seen here.,86.16,1.36
Or though a wound healing shoe,87.52,1.46
like the one I am holding.,88.98,1.68
"The wound healing shoe
has a special insert",90.66,2.05
that reduces friction and can be modified,92.71,2.49
to reduce pressure on your wound.,95.2,2.04
Remember a cast and a wound healing shoe,97.24,2.52
is only temporary.,99.76,1.4
Once your wound is healed,101.16,1.25
your provider will need to order,102.41,1.34
diabetic shoes and custom inserts,103.75,2.37
to prevent another ulcer.,106.12,1.9
Some important things to remember,108.02,1.92
"if your foot is painful, red,",109.94,2.03
"hot, swollen, has pus and a foul smell",111.97,3.069
like the wound you see here,115.039,2.531
"you should report to an
emergency room immediately",117.57,2.35
as you may have a diabetic foot infection.,119.92,2.53
This is very serious as you may,122.45,1.71
"need IV antibiotics to
treat your infection.",124.16,2.85
Also remember to only clean,127.01,1.65
"your diabetic foot wound
with soap and water.",128.66,2.4
Do not soak your foot.,131.06,1.33
Do not use bleach or hydrogen peroxide,132.39,2.1
to clean your ulcer.,134.49,1.07
"As it can worsen the ulcer
and the surrounding skin.",135.56,3.28
Thank you for watching this video.,138.84,1.43
"I hope you learned about
diabetic foot ulcers",140.27,2.32
and how to treat them.,142.59,1.42
Remember Michigan Podiatry is here,144.01,1.76
"to help you with all your
diabetic foot concerns.",145.77,2.543
