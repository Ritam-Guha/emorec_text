Research Foundation our mission is a,10.5,5.19
future without breast cancer and we do,13.049,5.281
that through innovative research into,15.69,4.38
the cause and prevention of the disease,18.33,4.89
in patient science is a series of videos,20.07,5.58
that help explain to you breast cancer,23.22,4.2
how it works and what your choices and,25.65,4.41
options are your healthcare team may not,27.42,4.56
be aware of a common type of long term,30.06,3.839
collateral damage called peripheral,31.98,3.84
neuropathy or pain and numbness in the,33.899,4.351
hands and feet neuropathy is a type of,35.82,4.14
nerve damage that can be caused by,38.25,4.079
chemotherapy if you have symptoms of,39.96,4.32
neuropathy during treatment doctors will,42.329,3.57
typically lower the dose you are getting,44.28,4.08
that may help but for some patients the,45.899,4.381
pain and numbness can continue for years,48.36,4.23
after the treatment ends we know very,50.28,4.65
little about how long neuropathy can,52.59,4.53
last and how many breast cancer patients,54.93,4.949
it affects researchers don't often study,57.12,4.56
it and doctors don't always ask their,59.879,4.17
patients about it if you do develop,61.68,4.56
neuropathy it can have a profound effect,64.049,4.621
on your quality of life so what can you,66.24,5.91
do the best option is prevention the,68.67,5.43
chemotherapy drugs most likely to cause,72.15,3.57
neuropathy are the taxanes,74.1,4.589
like taxall and taksa tear if these,75.72,5.219
drugs are being recommended ask your,78.689,4.081
doctor if there might be alternatives,80.939,3.961
you need to weigh the risks and benefits,82.77,5.58
of each drug if you are older overweight,84.9,5.67
had a mastectomy or had a high number of,88.35,4.08
positive lymph nodes your risk of,90.57,3.689
developing long-term neuropathy may be,92.43,4.41
higher in this case a conversation with,94.259,4.351
your doctor will be especially important,96.84,4.26
a small study recently found that,98.61,4.649
wearing cooled gloves and socks while,101.1,4.53
receiving chemotherapy reduced the,103.259,4.081
amount of drugs the hands and feet,105.63,3.75
received and therefore the risk for,107.34,4.739
neuropathy the most important thing is,109.38,4.62
to talk to your doctor about it it's the,112.079,3.241
