my secrets and treating Rob a thief,52.079,4.171
naturally ok let's start off with,53.969,4.14
vitamins let's start off with vitamins,56.25,4.26
and let's go on number one B vitamins,58.109,4.081
these are very very important and,60.51,3.389
rapidly B vitamins are the group of,62.19,3.81
vitamins that play many vital roles in,63.899,3.961
the body including nerve functions and,66.0,4.229
generating cellular activity the best,67.86,4.82
vitamins for neuropathy are b12 and b6,70.229,5.971
ok so look into that number 2 vitamin C,72.68,6.25
ok vitamin C is very important to this,76.2,4.529
vitam is especially significant to,78.93,4.14
diabetics ok or diabetic neuropathy,80.729,4.381
research has shown that most diabetics,83.07,4.589
have a lack of vitamin C as a result of,85.11,5.13
their illness rather than their diet ok,87.659,6.03
number 3 vitamin E okay let's get into,90.24,5.33
vitamin E again research shows that,93.689,4.11
supplementing with vitamin E alone can,95.57,5.29
improve peripheral neuropathy symptoms,97.799,5.011
and improve nerve function and health,100.86,4.32
all throughout especially type 2,102.81,6.18
diabetes okay and number 4 vitamin D,105.18,6.41
vitamin one study published in 2008,108.99,5.19
carried out with 51 patients found that,111.59,4.33
supplementing vitamin D reduced pain,114.18,4.439
levels by up to 50 percent so it's very,115.92,5.25
good okay now as we talked about,118.619,3.871
vitamins let's move on talk about,121.17,3.21
supplements in this,122.49,4.68
we also have four natural compounds,124.38,6.93
number one alpha lipoic acid okay,127.17,6.66
alpha book acids already used to treat,131.31,5.34
diabetic neuropathy in Germany and as an,133.83,4.23
approved treatment in that country and,136.65,3.919
research shows and demonstrates that,138.06,5.55
lipoic acid improves blood flow to the,140.569,4.571
nerves allowing the body to use energy,143.61,4.23
officially so remember guys alpha lipoic,145.14,7.52
acid okay number two acetyl l-carnitine,147.84,7.77
alright this is an amino acid which is,152.66,5.53
often used to treat a range of illnesses,155.61,5.4
including alzhiemer's disease in many,158.19,5.31
forms of other neuropathies also so look,161.01,5.81
into that number three n-acetylcysteine,163.5,6.42
or neck okay supplementing with nak,166.82,5.86
might help treat symptoms of neuropathy,169.92,5.7
and and you know functions as a potent,172.68,4.589
antioxidant as well as increasing,175.62,4.17
potential of your natural natural,177.269,3.811
occurring antioxidants in the body,179.79,4.35
called glutathione and my fourth but,181.08,4.77
very important supplement is magnesium,184.14,4.319
