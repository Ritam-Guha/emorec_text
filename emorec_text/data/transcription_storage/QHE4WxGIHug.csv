[Music],1.0,2.6
yeah so so treatment,2.24,3.76
almost always starts with pituitary,3.6,3.84
surgery,6.0,4.24
um and i think that's that's a surgery,7.44,5.119
called transphenoidal surgery,10.24,5.2
uh where uh the surgeon actually goes up,12.559,4.241
either through through the nose or,15.44,3.04
through the roof of the mouth,16.8,3.6
to the pituitary gland so there's no,18.48,3.04
external scar,20.4,3.84
that comes from that type of surgery i,21.52,3.919
think,24.24,4.4
it's incredibly important for for,25.439,7.12
anyone who's having pituitary surgery to,28.64,5.439
be seen by a surgeon that's experienced,32.559,3.68
with that particular type of surgery,34.079,3.841
um really like like most surgeries you,36.239,3.281
want to go to someone that that,37.92,4.799
does it frequently and there are,39.52,4.48
a number of surgeons in the u.s and,42.719,2.801
around the world that have a lot of,44.0,2.8
experience that are terrific surgeons,45.52,1.84
that are,46.8,3.279
generally pretty well known um so,47.36,4.32
surgery tends to be the is the first,50.079,3.281
line treatment,51.68,5.199
um and for patients that are not,53.36,6.24
cured there are uh there are a variety,56.879,4.401
of medical therapies which i'll come,59.6,3.04
back to in a second,61.28,3.599
as well as radiation therapy how to,62.64,3.839
treat the tumors,64.879,5.961
so so the medical therapies for uh for,66.479,5.921
acromegaly,70.84,3.16
the the bulk of the therapy are what's,72.4,3.759
called somatostatin analogs,74.0,5.119
and somatostatin is an is a hormone that,76.159,4.401
normally acts to suppress,79.119,3.68
growth hormone and there are a number of,80.56,4.4
synthetic versions of of semanostatin,82.799,3.521
that are used,84.96,2.96
typically they're given as a monthly,86.32,3.36
injection uh,87.92,4.32
a long-lasting injection and there are,89.68,3.36
there are,92.24,3.28
two major ones now there's uh uh,93.04,3.92
octreotide,95.52,3.44
uh and lanreantide and they work,96.96,3.76
similarly,98.96,3.439
no there have been guidelines published,100.72,3.28
by the endocrine society in the united,102.399,2.801
states and the european,104.0,3.759
society for endocrinology in europe uh,105.2,4.239
which which are,107.759,4.72
basically very similar guidelines uh,109.439,6.72
which is um surgery first,112.479,5.68
uh followed by cementostatin analogue so,116.159,4.481
either the octreotide or the or the,118.159,5.201
landriatide,120.64,5.759
sometimes with or um,123.36,4.64
with with the burglary and the oral,126.399,3.121
agent um,128.0,3.68
sometimes people try cabergulene first,129.52,3.2
but but,131.68,2.88
that as i said that tends to be less,132.72,3.2
effective,134.56,3.92
so typically the spen cementostatin,135.92,4.8
analogs are used first,138.48,6.24
um and then um,140.72,5.84
if the patient either can't tolerate it,144.72,4.0
or the drugs are not effective,146.56,4.8
uh then uh sometimes radiation is,148.72,3.68
considered as,151.36,3.48
in my view third line therapy for most,152.4,5.44
people,154.84,3.0
