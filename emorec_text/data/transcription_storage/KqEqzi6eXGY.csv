hey I want to do a quick video on why,0.03,4.32
someone would have high blood glucose on,2.22,4.77
keto and intermittent fasting so I've,4.35,4.65
talked about this in other videos but I,6.99,3.87
wanted to do one video on this one,9.0,5.13
specific point okay when your insulin,10.86,5.94
resistant which great majority of the,14.13,6.12
population is they usually have high,16.8,7.069
amounts of insulin in their body okay,20.25,6.599
five to nine times the normal amount,23.869,5.291
okay so they have massive amounts of,26.849,5.791
insulin now insulin regulates blood,29.16,5.82
sugars by controlling them pushing them,32.64,6.0
down so they they basically lower blood,34.98,6.78
sugar so if you have all this insulin in,38.64,5.7
the body you're automatically pushing in,41.76,4.92
keeping the blood sugar controlled,44.34,6.12
that's the purpose of it okay so here,46.68,5.73
you are going along you know you could,50.46,4.65
be eating junk food sugar whatever but,52.41,4.35
you still have normal blood glucose,55.11,4.32
because the high insulin is pushing it,56.76,5.4
down and you do that for ten years,59.43,4.619
whatever and then eventually the,62.16,4.65
mechanism breaks where the cells of the,64.049,5.671
pancreas get exhausted and then the,66.81,5.22
insulin goes down and then the blood,69.72,4.41
sugar just go up that's when you start,72.03,3.54
having pre-diabetes and then they go up,74.13,3.059
higher and you get diabetes that's how,75.57,2.39
it works,77.189,5.101
but the point is that before keto you,77.96,7.81
probably had high insulin and now you,82.29,5.7
get on keto in a minute fasting you're,85.77,4.38
taking all this insulin out of the,87.99,3.419
picture you're healing insulin,90.15,3.21
resistance and you're lowering insulin,91.409,3.841
to the point where it's going to be,93.36,2.7
normal,95.25,3.36
well guess what since your body is so,96.06,5.55
used to this you remove that push down,98.61,5.399
force and the blood sugars are going to,101.61,5.28
go up that's why but it's only going to,104.009,4.531
be for a period of time it's in the,106.89,3.509
transition phase but you're just taking,108.54,5.52
this weight off of blood sugars and it's,110.399,4.921
just going to start to rebound a little,114.06,3.599
bit okay but the point is it will,115.32,3.99
eventually come down now it's not going,117.659,3.99
to go too high it might come up to 110,119.31,5.73
but it's it might not be down here for a,121.649,5.311
while so you all you have to realize is,125.04,3.87
that you're actually getting better,126.96,4.109
insulin is coming down blood sugars are,128.91,4.17
coming higher and you just need to give,131.069,2.801
it more time,133.08,4.42
