so acromegaly is a disease,2.159,4.401
primarily caused by pituitary tumors,4.16,4.64
that secrete growth hormone,6.56,3.999
i think we all know that when you're a,8.8,3.839
child or a teenager and you're growing,10.559,6.401
taller you need growth hormone to grow,12.639,6.48
but even as an adult your body still,16.96,3.68
makes growth hormone and it seems to be,19.119,2.961
important for,20.64,3.52
maintaining things like skeletal muscle,22.08,5.76
and strength and energy and fatigue,24.16,3.68
and preventing fatigue and things like,28.24,4.88
that um so that's a normal,29.679,4.72
part of the pituitary gland there are,33.12,3.92
cells that secrete growth hormone,34.399,6.0
um and acromegaly arises when when,37.04,6.88
those cells develop into a tumor,40.399,5.041
these tumors are are located in the,43.92,3.119
pituitary gland which is a,45.44,3.52
small gland kind of off the base of the,47.039,4.081
brain that really sits sort of behind,48.96,3.84
the behind the nose or behind the eyes,51.12,4.88
is where it's actually located,52.8,3.2
and when uh,56.879,5.84
these tumors form and by the way they're,60.399,3.921
benign tumors almost always they're,62.719,3.601
almost never cancers,64.32,3.92
uh they're benign tumors but but they,66.32,3.04
cause problems because they make,68.24,2.239
hormones,69.36,3.439
um and what happens when the body as an,70.479,3.121
adult,72.799,3.36
um has too much growth hormone there are,73.6,4.96
parts of the body that can still grow,76.159,4.561
so for example mostly cartilage so so,78.56,4.4
the nose the ears,80.72,4.0
um some and some of the bones like in,82.96,3.36
the feet and the hands can,84.72,4.48
still grow so you'll see people that,86.32,5.36
have acromegaly have very,89.2,4.48
large ears they didn't have very,91.68,3.759
prominent sort of brow,93.68,5.2
brow ridges and also the chin is is,95.439,5.36
another part of the body that that still,98.88,3.519
grows typically people,100.799,4.801
even when they're adults um,102.399,4.4
and these are some of the features and,105.6,2.799
the other the other thing that that we,106.799,2.081
see,108.399,1.521
frequently in adults that have,108.88,3.68
acromegaly is is uh growth of the hands,109.92,4.559
and the feet so for for people that wear,112.56,2.879
rings,114.479,2.24
they'll notice a change in their ring,115.439,3.121
size or people often notice a change in,116.719,3.281
their shoe size,118.56,2.8
um and you know it's more than just,120.0,2.88
going from one brand to shoe to the,121.36,2.96
other brand or shoe that you know your,122.88,2.879
size may change but,124.32,3.52
if you're wearing the same shoe and it's,125.759,3.92
growing over time,127.84,3.199
that may that may be a sign of,129.679,3.841
acromegaly um obviously,131.039,5.28
if if a child has acromegaly before,133.52,4.16
they've reached their full adult height,136.319,2.0
they'll,137.68,2.639
continue to grow taller and that's why,138.319,4.161
you have people that are that are giants,140.319,5.201
um actually can be due to to acromegaly,142.48,5.04
uh people like like andre the giant was,145.52,4.32
a was very very well known and actor,147.52,3.52
richard keel,149.84,4.32
um also had uh had acromegaly the guy,151.04,4.64
who played jaws in many of the james,154.16,1.84
bond,155.68,3.6
films um usually the diagnosis,156.0,6.72
is made by an endocrinologist um,159.28,5.76
often someone that has you know some,162.72,5.04
expertise in pituitary diseases but but,165.04,4.32
you know most endocrinologists are,167.76,3.52
familiar with the condition,169.36,4.48
um you know sometimes you see a very,171.28,4.0
very astute uh,173.84,3.52
a primary care doctor can can suspect,175.28,3.599
the diagnosis and often can start the,177.36,2.32
work up,178.879,2.241
the other thing that we sometimes see is,179.68,3.44
actually uh dentists actually make the,181.12,3.92
that can make the diagnosis or suggest a,183.12,3.199
diagnosis because one of the other,185.04,3.04
things that happens is that,186.319,3.2
because the jaw can grow a little bit,188.08,3.2
the teeth,189.519,3.44
patient teeth tend to start to spread a,191.28,3.679
little bit and i've seen,192.959,4.881
i i've seen that happen where where,194.959,4.0
someone sent to me by,197.84,4.16
by a um by a dentist with a with,198.959,6.321
either the diagnosis made or or a strong,202.0,4.319
suspicion,205.28,2.879
that that's what the patient has,206.319,4.0
specific thing that i've seen is,208.159,3.921
is the changes in shoe size and ring,210.319,3.041
size,212.08,3.12
um a lot of the other things are are,213.36,3.519
much more subtle,215.2,3.36
um and i think the other thing that,216.879,3.28
that's actually really helpful for,218.56,2.88
people is if,220.159,4.401
a patient has a you know old photograph,221.44,4.4
of themselves from you know five or ten,224.56,2.56
years ago whether the truth has a,225.84,3.2
driver's license or,227.12,3.44
you know a picture with friends or,229.04,3.44
whatever now we all carry around our,230.56,3.52
cell phones which which have many years,232.48,1.839
of,234.08,3.28
photos on them at least for most people,234.319,5.12
and and often the physical changes if,237.36,3.12
you look,239.439,3.841
um you can see them um you know,240.48,4.88
obviously we all change as we get older,243.28,5.36
um but particularly the prominence of,245.36,3.599
the,248.64,3.36
of the the chin and the brow line,248.959,5.601
and the coarseness of the features are,252.0,3.92
something that can actually be,254.56,9.6
be noticed if you're looking for it,255.92,8.24
