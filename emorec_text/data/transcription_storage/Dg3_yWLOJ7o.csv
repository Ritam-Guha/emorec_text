hey bad news for everyone that's looking,0.21,4.769
for a magic pill for fat loss doesn't,2.58,4.319
really exist but what I'm finding,4.979,3.87
through a lot of research recently is,6.899,5.311
that vitamin d3 might be as close as we,8.849,4.591
can get to something that can reduce,12.21,3.27
belly fat and has anything that's out,13.44,4.08
there so let me explain how this works,15.48,3.57
because honestly it's pretty fascinating,17.52,3.99
so what vitamin D is first and foremost,19.05,4.71
is a fat soluble vitamin okay it's a fat,21.51,3.84
soluble vitamin that helps regulate mood,23.76,3.33
it can help regulate metabolism and most,25.35,3.84
importantly it regulates where calcium,27.09,4.47
goes in the body but because it's fat,29.19,4.77
soluble it means that it's stored in the,31.56,4.86
fat cell now start thinking about this,33.96,5.189
if you have an excess amount of fat or,36.42,4.709
if you're overweight well that means,39.149,3.6
that most of the vitamin D that you,41.129,2.971
consume even if you're taking a,42.749,3.45
supplement it's going to get sequestered,44.1,3.689
into those fat cells and it's going to,46.199,3.991
stay there meaning you have less bio,47.789,4.561
actively available vitamin d3,50.19,4.5
to do the cool things that I'm about to,52.35,4.799
explain but let's talk about how vitamin,54.69,5.129
d3 actually burns fat the first method,57.149,5.16
is by increasing something called leptin,59.819,5.371
now have you ever eaten food before and,62.309,5.701
gotten full if you haven't you're,65.19,5.34
probably not human because honestly what,68.01,4.8
happens is leptin signals your brain,70.53,4.95
that you're full when you eat a lot of,72.81,4.44
food you have the production of leptin,75.48,3.63
signals your brain that you're full and,77.25,4.56
you stop eating problem is that without,79.11,6.21
vitamin d3 leptin levels don't generally,81.81,5.64
increase that much so if you have enough,85.32,4.41
d3 your brain can signal and your brain,87.45,4.17
can be told you need to stop eating so,89.73,3.66
that's simple but low levels of vitamin,91.62,3.9
d3 those leptin levels don't get too,93.39,3.81
high and you can keep eating making it,95.52,3.9
very easy to overeat now remember what I,97.2,4.17
said about the vitamin d3 getting stored,99.42,4.77
in fat cells so think about this if you,101.37,5.25
already are low in d3 and then you eat,104.19,4.29
and you don't have enough left and so,106.62,3.51
you keep eating more well then you're,108.48,3.15
going to develop more fat cells which,110.13,2.61
means you're going to hold onto more,111.63,3.42
vitamin D in the fat cells and more and,112.74,3.78
more to the point where you have this,115.05,3.21
snowball effect where you continue to,116.52,3.66
store fat are you one of those people,118.26,3.3
that have just looked in the mirror and,120.18,3.24
said how did this happen to me honestly,121.56,3.81
I was one of those people seven or eight,123.42,4.589
years ago okay now the other way that,125.37,4.8
vitamin d3 is proving to potentially be,128.009,4.95
a good belly fat burner is through the,130.17,3.94
modulation of the,132.959,3.491
our thyroid and calcitriol hormones you,134.11,3.87
see the parathyroid is a small set of,136.45,3.36
gland around the thyroid in our throat,137.98,3.63
and basically when they produce,139.81,3.74
parathyroid when they produce calcitriol,141.61,5.13
we have a rapid increase in how our body,143.55,5.56
stores fat it tends to want to store it,146.74,4.95
more now if we have enough of vitamin d3,149.11,5.25
the parathyroid calcitriol hormones,151.69,4.59
aren't quite as crazy they're not going,154.36,4.08
quite as haywire which means your body,156.28,5.429
slowly stores and slowly metabolized sat,158.44,6.24
versus doing it rapidly making it where,161.709,4.561
you look in the mirror and feel like it,164.68,3.84
happened overnight so those are the two,166.27,4.2
main reasons that vitamin d3 is starting,168.52,3.87
to play a big role in belly fat but this,170.47,3.63
wouldn't be a traditional video of mine,172.39,3.18
if I didn't at least reference one,174.1,3.84
peer-reviewed double-blind placebo study,175.57,6.27
that one study took 218 women get these,177.94,7.38
218 women they gave a strict diet and,181.84,5.16
exercise program - and they asked them,185.32,3.84
to follow it for a year okay then they,187.0,3.72
took half of these women and they gave,189.16,4.2
them vitamin D the other half the women,190.72,5.97
they gave a placebo well after one year,193.36,5.25
of time it was found that the wind that,196.69,5.1
took the vitamin D has on average seven,198.61,5.34
pounds more weight loss and those that,201.79,3.9
didn't take the vitamin D it doesn't,203.95,3.96
sound like much but just by adding,205.69,4.17
vitamin D it's pretty dang interesting,207.91,3.6
but then there's one other study there's,209.86,3.03
another study that found that those that,211.51,3.9
were taking vitamin d3 had a better,212.89,4.319
waist-to-hip ratio than those that were,215.41,4.44
not so what I can hypothesize from these,217.209,5.131
two studies is that potentially vitamin,219.85,4.29
D could be a link between weight loss,222.34,4.05
being somewhat site-specific,224.14,5.73
to the belly fat area now it's not the,226.39,5.069
end-all be-all and there is a lot more,229.87,3.39
science and a lot more research that,231.459,3.84
needs to be conducted but in general,233.26,3.6
we're heading the right direction and,235.299,3.75
just so that you guys know if you have,236.86,4.11
any ideas for videos post them in the,239.049,3.421
comment section I'd love to hear them,240.97,3.0
especially surrounding the world of,242.47,3.06
belly fat especially surrounding the,243.97,3.78
world of vitamins and minerals but also,245.53,4.17
