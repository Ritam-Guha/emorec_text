hello my name is dr. Simon Fraser,0.0,4.31
consultants in clinical neurophysiology,2.37,4.23
this video will provide you with an,4.31,4.63
explanation of diabetic neuropathy what,6.6,3.81
it is the different types and why,8.94,3.84
patients develop them you can also find,10.41,4.5
out more about current treatments by,12.78,5.06
clicking on the information card above,14.91,5.879
diabetes causes raise sugar levels in,17.84,5.699
the blood this is called hyperglycemia,20.789,4.74
hyperglycemia over prolonged periods of,23.539,3.971
time is associated with blood vessel,25.529,4.441
disease when it affects the large blood,27.51,4.109
vessels it causes what we call the,29.97,4.13
microvascular complications of diabetes,31.619,5.251
this is where it can cause clogging of,34.1,5.26
the large arteries to the heart where it,36.87,4.89
predisposes to heart attacks causing,39.36,3.81
clogging of the large arteries of the,41.76,3.72
brain where it can predispose to strokes,43.17,3.99
and causing clogging of the large,45.48,3.45
arteries so the legs and arms where it,47.16,3.68
can cause peripheral vascular disease,48.93,4.05
when it affects the smaller blood,50.84,3.67
vessels it causes what we call the,52.98,4.07
microvascular complications of diabetes,54.51,5.189
namely damage to the structures in the,57.05,5.439
kidney causing nephropathy damage to the,59.699,4.29
structures in the eye causing,62.489,4.351
retinopathy and damage to the structures,63.989,6.481
of the nerves causing neuropathy this,66.84,5.91
video will focus on diabetic neuropathy,70.47,5.18
ie the nerve damage caused by diabetes,72.75,5.909
firstly some statistics diabetes is,75.65,6.55
really common and in 2014 it's affected,78.659,6.301
3.5 million patients in the UK with this,82.2,5.34
number steadily rising diabetic,84.96,4.56
neuropathy will affect around fifty to,87.54,4.59
sixty percent of diabetics twenty five,89.52,4.62
percent of diabetics will have this as a,92.13,4.59
painful neuropathy around fifty percent,94.14,4.74
will have autonomic fibre involvement,96.72,4.02
causing impaired bowel movements for,98.88,3.69
example and for many men at least a,100.74,5.25
third erectile dysfunction these,102.57,5.52
complications are mainly time-dependent,105.99,4.169
so the longer patients have diabetes the,108.09,3.419
more susceptible they become in,110.159,3.42
developing these complications they are,111.509,4.021
also blood sugar level dependent so,113.579,3.57
poorly controlled diabetics are more,115.53,3.42
likely to develop some of these,117.149,4.891
conditions many patients do not,118.95,5.16
recognize the symptoms of this and can,122.04,3.509
present with further problems such as,124.11,4.2
foot ulcers and gangrene thus we really,125.549,4.68
need to understand this condition detect,128.31,3.72
it early prevent its progress,130.229,4.261
and treat it effectively to prevent,132.03,5.97
worst complications from occurring when,134.49,5.64
we think about diabetic neuropathy we,138.0,3.75
need to understand both the mechanisms,140.13,3.42
of this condition and the different,141.75,3.87
types of patterns of nerve damage that,143.55,5.04
it can cause this can help us determine,145.62,6.119
the underlying mechanism of the,148.59,5.19
neuropathy and target treatment,151.739,5.101
accordingly you can find a link to my,153.78,4.32
overview of all of these different,156.84,3.479
conditions posted on my wordpress site,158.1,3.6
by clicking the link in the information,160.319,4.981
box below so let's try and understand,161.7,6.18
the most important mechanism metabolic,165.3,6.02
microvascular hypoxia or MMH for short,167.88,6.09
nerves are living tissues I need oxygen,171.32,5.56
to survive they have tiny arteries,173.97,5.7
called the Vezina forum which pump blood,176.88,5.85
laden with oxygen to them raise blood,179.67,5.22
Sugar's bind to structures and proteins,182.73,4.339
in the artery walls in a process called,184.89,5.99
glycosylation and causes them to thicken,187.069,7.621
this is called diabetic microangiopathy,190.88,6.46
because oxygen has to diffuse across the,194.69,4.42
walls of the blood vessels to make its,197.34,4.14
way into the nerve cell tissue beneath,199.11,4.439
any increase in blood vessel thickness,201.48,4.5
will impair the transfer of oxygen this,203.549,5.101
causes hypoxia a lack of oxygen to the,205.98,4.56
tissue which ultimately leads to nerve,208.65,4.08
damage and death in addition excess,210.54,4.08
sugars are absorbed into the cell walls,212.73,4.11
of nerve fibers are not converted but,214.62,4.29
the polyol pal throw into sucrose and,216.84,4.59
fructose this sin causes excess fluids,218.91,4.44
to be drawn into the cells by process,221.43,4.619
called osmotic pressure swooned cells,223.35,4.65
become enlarged and dysfunctional which,226.049,3.631
leads to further nerve tissue damage and,228.0,4.04
impairment of transmitting nerve signals,229.68,4.41
smaller nerves tend to be more,232.04,4.15
susceptible to these processes and so,234.09,4.05
painful small fiber neuropathy are more,236.19,4.95
common we also often see a length,238.14,5.58
dependent process this is where the more,241.14,5.01
distant nerves which are very thin as a,243.72,4.769
taper off become more affected as,246.15,4.8
they're more susceptible hence feet tend,248.489,4.411
to be affected more often and before the,250.95,4.59
hands the type of damage diabetes causes,252.9,5.04
usually affects the axons are you the,255.54,4.619
wire core of the nerve it can also,257.94,3.96
affect the myelin sheath as well and,260.159,3.411
this is particularly the case in,261.9,4.61
controlled diabetes diabetes can also,263.57,5.25
cause activation of the immune system to,266.51,3.99
inflict damage on the nerves by,268.82,3.56
mechanisms we don't fully understand,270.5,4.8
these can cause inflammatory conditions,272.38,5.83
such as cidp painful diabetic neuropathy,275.3,5.07
with extreme weight loss and contribute,278.21,3.87
to the development of diabetic Black,280.37,4.25
Sabbath II and cranial nerve palsies,282.08,4.8
nerves can also become more susceptible,284.62,4.42
to compression your apathy s such as,286.88,3.99
carpal tunnel syndrome cubital tunnel,289.04,3.75
syndrome common peroneal nerve,290.87,3.51
compression across the feeble your neck,292.79,4.86
and morale repair aesthetica mechanisms,294.38,5.88
for this include linkage to obesity,297.65,6.15
increased nerve fragility and fibrous,300.26,5.55
deposition causing reduced mobility of,303.8,4.5
the nerves across the joints nerves can,305.81,3.66
also become damaged following,308.3,3.51
complications of diabetes slightly short,309.47,4.35
term complications such as hypoglycemic,311.81,4.71
events or diabetic ketoacidosis this is,313.82,3.81
thought to arise either from a,316.52,2.64
relatively transient metabolic,317.63,3.54
dysfunction or from small clots blocking,319.16,4.95
up the vision of orem additionally they,321.17,4.32
can also be caused by more long-term,324.11,3.75
complications such as diabetic kidney,325.49,5.76
failure a very rare complication can,327.86,5.46
also transiently arise following,331.25,3.84
commencement of insulin and this is,333.32,3.33
called incident i right asst but,335.09,3.36
fortunately tends to self resolve after,336.65,5.13
a few months this slide summarizes the,338.45,4.47
different patterns of nerve involvement,341.78,3.3
