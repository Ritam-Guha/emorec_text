"Hello, my name is Dave
and I am an anorexic.",7.717,6.114
"I have been recovering from anorexia
for the past eight or nine years;",13.832,4.037
everyone needs a hobby.,17.87,1.848
(Laughter),19.719,1.362
That is what this is all about.,22.521,2.019
"Before we kick off, I am
very comfortable talking about this.",24.541,2.915
"I do not want anyone
to be awkward or kind of cringing.",27.457,4.623
"You can see me,
I am not butch or tough.",32.081,3.254
"I will be honest; I do not even
have a strong bladder.",35.336,2.784
(Laughter),38.121,1.735
"That is what this is for.
It is just a massive TENA pad.",39.876,2.751
(Laughter),42.628,1.65
"If you saw me in the street,
you are not going to think,",46.618,2.665
"""Phwoa! There is an alpha male.""",49.292,2.834
"Much more likely, ""Oh, vegetarian!""",52.133,2.286
(Laughter),54.42,1.965
"You would be right because
I have been veggie for a while now.",56.386,4.64
There are certain things that I miss.,61.027,2.257
A lot of respect.,63.285,1.628
(Laughter),64.914,1.635
"There is a really good
reason that I bring it up.",67.479,2.654
"There are 1.6 million people in the UK
that suffer with eating disorders.",70.134,4.822
"Probably more, because a lot of people
feel embarrassed to talk about it.",74.957,5.125
"A lot of people do not realise
that they are suffering,",80.083,2.593
and that was exactly the same for me.,82.677,1.855
"A lot of my friends,
when I slipped into all of this,",84.533,2.522
"asked me how I was losing
so much weight so quickly,",87.056,2.729
and I guess I was embarrassed.,89.786,2.714
I used to tell them it was a combination,92.501,2.35
"of the Atkins diet,
coupled with being vegetarian.",94.852,3.668
(Laughter),98.521,2.918
"Just sounds much nicer, right?",101.44,3.313
"By trade, I am a stand-up comic",104.754,3.425
"and I love the unique ability
that comedy has to reach people.",108.18,5.353
"I really wanted to use that
in order to help,",113.534,2.549
"and in order to change
how we see mental health.",116.084,3.798
It was a difficult show to write.,119.883,3.043
"It was a really tricky one
because I had to be funny,",122.927,2.741
but I had to be informative as well.,125.669,3.355
Obviously I wanted to be sensitive.,129.025,1.839
We did not always get the balance right.,130.865,2.433
"When we took it on tour
to the Leicester Comedy Festival,",133.299,2.741
"one of the first reviews said that the bit
I did on bulimia was too, ""Gag-heavy"".",136.041,5.724
(Laughter),141.766,1.166
"It is like saying a show on domestic
violence lacks punchlines.",144.552,4.066
But it is absolutely true.,148.619,2.517
"I want to promote change,
especially towards mental health,",151.137,2.838
"because we have not changed
our attitude in the UK to mental health",153.976,3.501
"since the Victorian era, really.",157.478,2.821
"Then we would have freak shows,
now we have reality TV.",160.3,3.979
"We just have not come that far,
and I wanted to use that.",164.28,3.85
"I will never forget the first time
that I ever tried this in a show.",168.131,4.248
"It was awkward. It was horrible,
it was awkward, everyone was really...",172.38,3.665
and it wasn't ready.,176.046,2.059
"After the show, a woman came up to me,
and she stood there, and she said,",178.106,4.354
"""You were not really anorexic, were you?""",182.461,4.002
"I could not help but think,
""Are you calling me fat?""",186.464,3.05
(Laughter),189.515,1.369
"I said, ""It is all absolutely true.""",192.414,1.842
"She just turned around,
and she walked off.",194.257,2.763
"I thought, ""I have offended this woman,""
and that is the last thing I want to do.",197.021,6.019
"Then five minutes later, she came back,
and she stood there, and she said,",203.041,3.824
"""I can help you.
I can help you get over this.""",206.866,4.284
"Then from behind her back,
she produced a packet of crisps.",211.151,5.342
"Like the answer to this neurological,
psychological, mental health disorder",216.494,5.926
was a packet of Monster Munch.,222.421,3.158
It was only then that I realised,225.58,1.959
"how little people
actually know about this.",227.54,2.851
So I decided to start telling my story.,230.392,3.223
"For me, this all began when I was 17,",233.616,3.402
"and I had just got
the lead role in a play.",237.019,3.545
"It was a play called, ""Sparkleshark"".",240.584,2.653
(Laughter),243.238,1.953
I am not even gay.,245.192,1.825
(Laughter),247.018,1.923
I am as surprised as you.,248.942,1.634
(Laughter),250.577,1.514
So is my boyfriend.,253.761,1.659
(Laughter),255.421,1.819
I am not homophobic either.,258.7,2.234
Some of my best friends enjoy musicals.,260.935,2.344
(Laughter),263.28,2.295
I am of course kidding.,265.576,1.52
"I am a very left-wing person,
I am very liberal.",267.097,2.283
"The only thing I cannot
tolerate is gluten.",269.381,3.248
"I got this role in this play,
and I had to appear topless.",273.469,5.037
"I guess it was the first time that I have
ever had to think about my body.",278.507,4.256
I decided to lose a little bit of weight.,282.764,2.056
"I just did the usual thing;
cut out snacking.",284.821,2.185
"I just had three meals,
and I lost a bit of weight.",287.007,2.404
"Wanted to lose more,
so I cut out breakfast,",289.412,2.052
"just had two meals,
lost a bit of weight.",291.465,2.209
"Wanted to lose a bit more,",293.675,1.244
"and then cut out breakfast
and dinner and just had tea,",294.92,3.024
and lost a bit more.,297.945,1.391
"It was a great way to save
money on food bills.",299.337,2.748
"Although what I did lose in weight,
I also lost in Nectar points.",302.086,3.454
(Laughter),305.541,2.051
It is not all happy families.,307.593,2.565
"As I lost the weight, something
incredible happened,",310.159,2.921
"and I got noticed by this one amazing,
beautiful, wonderful, awesome girl.",313.081,6.531
"For legal reasons,
I am not going to name her.",320.542,2.411
"I am not going to get within 50 feet
of her after this goes online.",322.954,4.506
"All you need to know is she was amazing,
we started dating, and I fell in love.",327.461,5.136
She became my heroine.,332.598,3.047
"By which I mean, she was addictive,
exciting, and blooming expensive.",335.646,4.974
"But like heroine, she also became
a cause for me to lose weight;",341.58,3.756
"she became an inspiration to draw
me on, to lose more of my fat.",345.337,5.112
"Not that she ever made me. I really
want to get that across as well.",350.45,3.2
"She actually never actively
made me lost weight.",353.651,3.035
She hated that I was skinnier than her.,356.687,2.463
I will never forget one conversation.,359.151,1.842
"""Does my bum look big in this""",360.994,2.39
"""No, Dave.""",363.385,1.337
(Laughter),364.723,2.519
"""I am over this.""",367.243,1.312
"You have to understand that in my mind,",368.555,1.895
"I correlated getting skinny
with getting this incredible girl.",370.45,2.938
"In my mind, I correlated getting skinny
with being good-looking,",373.389,3.49
skinny meant success.,376.88,1.385
I know that is mental now.,378.266,1.274
"I understand no girl has ever been asked,
""What do you look for in the ideal bloke?""",379.541,3.979
"""Ooh, rickets!""",383.521,1.731
(Laughter),385.253,2.579
"In my mind, that made sense.",387.833,1.55
"Inevitably when we broke up
and she broke my heart,",389.384,2.59
that was when it spiraled out of control.,391.975,2.466
"If we are talking about change,
one of the things that I want to change",394.442,3.423
"is that anorexia is not to do with vanity,
and it is very little to do with weight.",397.866,5.959
"It is about addiction,
obsession, and control.",403.826,3.374
"For example, I became absolutely
obsessed with exercising.",407.201,4.358
"Anytime I had eaten anything,
no matter how much,",411.56,2.424
"I would run upstairs to my room,
I would do 50 push-ups,",413.985,3.92
"I would do 50 sit-ups
and I would do 20 squats.",417.906,4.11
"It was then that my mum and dad
realised that something was up.",422.017,3.889
"They never approached me. They never
said anything to me about this.",425.907,4.675
"I did not know the reason
until I asked them recently.",430.583,3.61
"I said to my mum, ""Why, when you knew
something was up with the exercise,",434.194,3.65
"why didn't you say anything to me?""",437.845,2.469
She gave the most beautiful answer.,440.315,1.73
"She said, ""Dave, when your teenage son
keeps on running up to his room,",442.046,5.311
"and all you can hear is rhythmical
banging, followed by repeated grunting,",447.358,6.159
"you tend not to ask questions.""",453.518,2.417
"I thought it was really sweet until my dad
put his hand on her shoulder and said,",455.936,3.868
"""I thought you were a sex pest"".",459.805,1.869
(Laughter),461.675,1.369
"""Sex pest"". You never expected
those words at TEDx.",465.464,3.426
"Also, I became obsessed with weighing
myself, on a neurological level.",468.891,5.341
"I started weighing myself in the morning,",474.233,2.041
"then I started weighing
myself in the evening,",476.275,2.268
to see how much my weight fluctuated.,478.544,1.815
Then mid-day to inspire me to eat less.,480.36,3.033
"On average, about five times a day,",483.394,2.417
"I used to run upstairs, lock
my door, and weigh myself.",485.812,3.652
"Five times a day,
I used to lock myself away.",489.465,4.146
Dad thought I converted to Islam.,493.612,3.38
"When he found out what was going on,",496.993,1.924
"he said, ""Oh, I thought I was going
to have to buy you a Qur'an.""",498.918,3.345
"I said, ""Dad, we have been
over this. I am vegetarian.",502.264,2.786
"It is pronounced 'Quorn'.""",505.051,1.825
(Laughter),506.885,2.244
"Side-note on that: when we did
The Birmingham Comedy Festival,",509.13,2.952
"a lovely Muslim fellow came
up to me after the show, and he said,",512.083,3.149
"""I really enjoyed the show,
it was absolutely lovely.",515.232,2.533
But you are a very weak person.,517.765,1.744
"Because what you call, ""anorexia"",
us Islamists just call Ramadan.""",519.51,4.241
(Laughter),523.768,1.855
Really nice.,525.624,1.532
"I also became obsessed
with calories as well.",528.856,2.724
Obsessed with calorie counting.,531.581,2.324
"To reduce calories,
I reduced portion sizes,",533.906,3.039
"so what I called, ""Sunday lunch"",
everyone else just called ""tapas"".",536.946,4.665
"It was weird for my mum
and dad at this point in time;",541.612,2.708
I am cheaper to feed than the cat was.,544.321,2.707
They did not know what to do.,547.029,1.716
"They went and sought help in the church,
they tried to drag me along.",548.746,3.849
I was going nowhere near that place.,552.596,2.979
Bread and wine? Talk about empty calories.,555.576,3.486
"I heard stories of miracles
and was entirely unimpressed.",559.063,2.77
"Five loaves, two fishes, 5,000 people.",561.834,2.294
"That is plenty to go around, you know?",564.129,3.414
"Because I did not realise I had a problem,
until I ended up in hospital.",567.544,6.007
"I ended up in hospital
due to coffee-loading.",573.552,4.368
"Side-note on that: in case
you do not know what that is,",577.921,2.848
"""coffee-loading"" is where
you substitute food for coffee.",580.77,3.932
"Coffee gives you all of the energy,
but none of the calories of food.",584.703,4.052
"Something you might not
realise about coffee",588.756,2.68
"is that coffee reduces
your pulse rate when you do not eat.",591.437,4.436
"Because you have got no fuel in your body,
that reduces your pulse too.",595.874,4.27
Mine got down to about 46 beats a minute.,600.145,4.083
"If you get anywhere below 40,",604.229,1.922
"it is what is medically
known as 'heart block'.",606.152,2.86
"And unfortunately,
it is incompatible with life.",609.013,3.865
"I got rushed to the hospital,
and as I sat there,",612.879,3.893
"I got talking to this building, builder.",616.773,3.227
(Laughter),620.001,1.646
It was going so well!,625.637,2.644
"Do not worry. They will
fix that in the edit!",630.651,2.767
"Just to ruin it, I am going
to do it on this side now.",633.423,2.667
"The editor is going to have
a massive field day.",636.091,3.569
"Where were we? Serious point,
thank you very much.",639.661,3.185
"I was there, I was talking
to this builder, a lovely bloke.",642.847,4.993
"It turns out he was there because
he had circular sawed though his femur.",647.841,5.101
"After a while, we got talking,
and he said,",655.082,2.43
"""Anyway, enough about me,
what about you? Why are you here?""",657.513,5.347
"Let me tell you, nothing
is more embarrassing in life,",662.861,2.873
than when you look at a bloke,665.735,1.519
"who is bleeding through the lower
part of his body and you go,",667.255,3.051
"""Why am I here? Oh, too much coffee!""",670.307,2.344
(Laughter),672.652,2.195
"You look like a bit of a 'word
that I am not allowed to say'.",674.848,3.966
It is bizarre.,678.815,1.843
Anorexia is a big problem.,680.659,1.715
"It affects people like Kelly Clarkson,
Lily Allen, Victoria Beckham.",682.375,4.209
It is a huge problem.,686.589,1.856
"It is responsible
for a lot of rubbish music.",688.446,3.018
(Laughter),691.465,1.419
Those are famous female anorexics.,697.774,2.726
"I asked my housemate if he could
name any famous male anorexics,",700.501,3.44
"and he just went, ""Gandhi?""",703.959,2.209
"I said, ""No!""",707.447,1.489
"There is a gap in the market
for the first famous male anorexic.",710.546,4.441
It is not a very big gap.,714.988,1.888
(Laughter),716.877,2.632
That is not why I am doing this.,719.51,1.685
"I do not want fame or glory.
I am not doing it for that.",721.196,4.321
I do not want to be on television;,725.518,1.683
"the camera adds ten pounds,
you can go away.",727.202,4.275
"Men are much more likely to get bulimia
as well, that is something I meant to say.",731.478,4.593
"Only about 90% of anorexics
that we know of are female.",736.072,5.555
"Anywhere between 10% and 25%
are male, and that is on the increase.",741.628,5.112
Men are much more likely to get bulimia,746.741,2.373
"so there are a lot of famous
examples of male bulimics;",749.115,2.646
people like Elton John was bulimic.,751.762,3.125
So 'Rocket Man'? It is all about salad.,754.888,4.215
"It is an incredibly big problem in the UK,",759.104,3.3

the UK's largest eating disorder charity.",766.718,3.767
"They gave me an award for the show
and the tour last year,",770.486,3.026

"I have a women there
that manages me called Rebecca,",775.067,2.939

to send Rebecca at Beat an email.",779.961,3.729
"I pulled a pen out of my pocket and wrote
on the back of my hand, ""Beat, Rebecca"".",783.691,6.85

next to me thought.",790.542,2.838

really lazy domestic abuse.""",793.381,4.506

looked at him and went, ""She deserves it.""",797.888,6.869

all the mucking about,",878.32,3.892

that it is nothing to be ashamed of.",918.863,4.182

so that we can help sufferers.",923.046,3.833

get that woman to realise that no,",926.88,4.806
