many people are concerned about the risk,4.97,4.81
of diabetes and many people haven't,7.77,4.409
already if you have type-2 diabetes,9.78,6.96
though it can be a two-way street and to,12.179,7.731
begin a diet change to reverse diabetes,16.74,6.93
step one is to avoid animal products now,19.91,5.199
you might be thinking wait a minute I,23.67,4.609
thought I was supposed to avoid sugar or,25.109,6.66
avoid bread or maybe rice,28.279,7.421
well these carbohydrates do release,31.769,5.611
glucose into the blood and that's why,35.7,4.289
people thought okay that sugar must be,37.38,4.65
the problem but it turns out that the,39.989,4.111
real problem with diabetes is the,42.03,4.89
build-up of fat inside the cells of the,44.1,5.49
body when fat builds up in your muscle,46.92,5.4
cells or in your liver cells the sugar,49.59,4.89
can't get inside and that's the problem,52.32,4.44
and so that's why step one is to avoid,54.48,4.349
animal products because when we do,56.76,4.819
there's no animal fat in the diet at all,58.829,5.4
that helps the cells to clean out step,61.579,5.65
two keep vegetable oils to a minimum if,64.229,4.89
you're the kind of person who is making,67.229,3.721
dinner and you take your bottle of oil,69.119,4.021
and you go glug glug glug glug glug glug,70.95,4.59
glug glug glug oil all over everything,73.14,5.31
that fat gets into your cells too and,75.54,6.42
that's a problem so step three is choose,78.45,7.739
the healthiest foods so white bread okay,81.96,6.81
but rye bread or pumpernickel much,86.189,3.031
better,88.77,2.43
the whole-grain breads are better white,89.22,5.16
potatoes are okay but a sweet potato is,91.2,5.61
much better if you're having a breakfast,94.38,4.919
cereal made for children that's going to,96.81,4.32
raise your blood sugar especially if the,99.299,4.53
box of cereal has a toy inside you know,101.13,4.71
what I'm talking about have a healthier,103.829,4.141
kind of something like oatmeal porridge,105.84,4.65
or bran syrup that's better for you,107.97,6.3
instead of sugar have fruit apples and,110.49,6.03
bananas and oranges and peaches these,114.27,4.32
foods taste sweet but they're very,116.52,4.739
gentle on your blood sugar so step one,118.59,4.889
get away from the animal product step,121.259,4.65
two keep the oil very low step three,123.479,4.941
choose the healthiest sources of,125.909,6.151
carbohydrate and over time your diabetes,128.42,6.22
might start to improve no I have one,132.06,4.89
last thing though let your doctor know,134.64,4.23
that you're going to do this because,136.95,3.6
although these steps sound very simple,138.87,4.47
they can be very very powerful and if,140.55,4.11
you're taking medicine for your diabetes,143.34,4.83
your blood sugar can start to fall too,144.66,5.76
low when you're on a very healthy diet,148.17,4.8
so your doctor can reduce your medicine,150.42,4.56
as the diet starts to bring your blood,152.97,4.56
sugar down naturally and that's going to,154.98,4.05
be the best part of the solution good,157.53,3.65
luck,159.03,2.15
