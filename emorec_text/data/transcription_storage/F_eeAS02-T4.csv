this particular patient has a retinal,5.75,6.16
changes called diabetic retinopathy,9.99,5.279
which are due to having had diabetes for,11.91,6.09
a number of years the scan on the left,15.269,6.541
is is an Oct scan optical computerized,18.0,6.06
tomography which effectively takes a,21.81,4.67
cross-sectional look through the retina,24.06,6.059
and what we can see here is that the,26.48,6.759
retina has little dark areas within it,30.119,5.641
the redness a bit thickened due to fluid,33.239,4.531
within the retina and this is because,35.76,4.47
with diabetes over a number of years it,37.77,4.559
can just damage the little capillaries,40.23,4.309
in the retina and make them leaky and,42.329,5.431
the fluid in the retina can make the,44.539,5.5
vision quite blurred and make it,47.76,4.68
difficult to read small print or see,50.039,4.441
insulin if you need to inject insulin of,52.44,4.77
your diabetic this particular patient,54.48,6.0
has been treated with in the last year,57.21,5.759
with a monoclonal antibody against a,60.48,4.259
growth factor which was a hugely,62.969,3.781
important development that has come as a,64.739,3.63
result of a number of years of clinical,66.75,3.9
research but what we were finding with,68.369,4.591
her was that the treatment was working,70.65,4.53
very well but wasn't lasting for a very,72.96,4.65
long time in particular because she's,75.18,4.799
had some surgery before to her I called,77.61,4.439
a vitrectomy which means that the drug,79.979,4.53
doesn't last for very long in the eye so,82.049,4.89
we've just given her a very novel,84.509,4.5
treatment which we were involved in one,86.939,4.561
of the clinical trials for it was a,89.009,4.741
multicenter trial done in the USA and,91.5,6.72
Europe and this drug is a clever slow,93.75,5.7
release preparation of an,98.22,2.969
anti-inflammatory treatment that you can,99.45,4.44
inject into the eye and it slowly slowly,101.189,6.151
releases on a daily basis the drug in,103.89,5.64
very small quantities and it can act for,107.34,4.38
up to three years so this is hugely,109.53,4.32
altered the quality of life of this,111.72,4.109
patient is significantly reduced to,113.85,3.449
fluid at the back of the eye and as,115.829,2.97
meant that rather than needing to come,117.299,3.631
back for monthly injections they've been,118.799,4.441
able to be assessed much less frequently,120.93,4.71
and haven't needed any recent treatments,123.24,4.44
this is a very good example where this,125.64,4.649
particular patient ten years ago would,127.68,4.74
have probably been registered as,130.289,3.661
certainly partially sighted,132.42,4.2
not blind and now they're having a very,133.95,4.5
good quality of life so there have been,136.62,3.509
huge developments over the last 10 years,138.45,3.509
and we're not static that you know we,140.129,3.241
are where we are at the moment the,141.959,3.0
treatments are not perfect and there's,143.37,3.509
always more that can be done even if,144.959,3.331
it's just improving the treatment,146.879,4.771
regimes rather than the actual outcomes,148.29,5.1
it may be that we could see people less,151.65,4.53
often or not have to give so much,153.39,4.2
treatment to it to the eye,156.18,11.6
