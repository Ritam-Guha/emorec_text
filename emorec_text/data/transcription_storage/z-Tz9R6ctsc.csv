you,20.039,2.06
hello I'm Chris shuttle certified,27.52,5.31
and hyperbaric specialists in this video,30.46,4.02
I'll be demonstrating how to apply the,32.83,3.99
snap bridge dressing on a diabetic foot,34.48,4.56
ulcer when treating a chronic wound on,36.82,4.5
the plantar surface of the foot it's,39.04,4.71
sometimes beneficial to use a dressing,41.32,4.74
that positions support and the tubing,43.75,4.559
away from the wound to minimize the,46.06,4.52
chance of additional pressure points as,48.309,5.25
you can see here this patient has a,50.58,5.14
diabetic foot ulcer on the base of the,53.559,4.381
foot since it's a low extra dating wound,55.72,4.83
the snap bridge dressing is a good,57.94,4.38
choice for delivering negative pressure,60.55,3.48
wound therapy let's see how to,62.32,4.11
effectively apply this dressing to,64.03,6.18
ensure a secure protective seal in this,66.43,6.03
challenging area begin by preparing the,70.21,4.049
wound bed and parry wound skin,72.46,4.11
according to institutional protocols if,74.259,5.25
necessary apply a skin protectant to the,76.57,5.82
surrounding skin next cut the blue foam,79.509,4.531
to fit the size and shape of the wound,82.39,3.479
place the foam into the wound cavity,84.04,3.84
making sure it fills the cavity without,85.869,4.201
stuffing the foam into the cavity and,87.88,3.989
extends above the warm margins,90.07,3.45
since this wound is on the plantar,91.869,3.661
surface of the foot we want to minimize,93.52,4.41
the chance of additional pressure points,95.53,4.589
the dressing kit should be oriented so,97.93,4.35
the bridge portion of the dressing lies,100.119,4.981
flat on the foot and the port is located,102.28,5.25
on a non weight-bearing surface to help,105.1,4.29
create a seal you can use the snap,107.53,4.56
secure ring hydrocolloid a sterile Motul,109.39,5.04
ring designed to provide fast and easy,112.09,4.709
sealing on uneven skin surfaces and,114.43,4.53
challenging body contours shape the,116.799,4.591
snaps secure ring hydrocolloid to fit,118.96,4.35
around the outside of the patient's,121.39,4.14
wound using light pressure apply the,123.31,4.709
snaps secure bring hydrocolloid around,125.53,4.35
the wound leave at least one centimeter,128.019,4.351
of intact skin between the snap secure,129.88,4.65
ring hydrocolloid and the wound margin,132.37,4.2
now we're ready to begin application of,134.53,4.32
the snap bridge dressing kit slowly peel,136.57,4.35
away the center release liner place the,138.85,4.74
snap dressing over the wound to maintain,140.92,4.47
a proper seal the dressings should be,143.59,4.2
adhere to at least one centimeter of,145.39,4.68
intact skin gently smooth out the,147.79,3.99
hydrocolloid dressing to remove any,150.07,4.02
small creases next remove the side,151.78,4.86
release liners and carefully press the,154.09,4.89
rest of the hydrocolloid dressing to the,156.64,4.77
skin smooth out the dressing with your,158.98,4.45
hands to ensure an air,161.41,4.18
Titebond to the skin we're out the,163.43,4.649
bridge section of the dressing away from,165.59,4.709
the wound in order to avoid contact,168.079,4.08
pressure at the wound and secure the,170.299,4.02
bridge section to the patient once the,172.159,3.961
dressing is in place cut the tubing to,174.319,3.78
the desired line to decrease the hazard,176.12,4.02
of the patient tripping insert the tube,178.099,4.051
fitting into the tubing and connect the,180.14,6.26
snap therapy cartridge to the tube city,182.15,4.25
to activate the snap therapy cartridge,186.709,5.161
press down on the activation reset key,189.14,5.28
and pull it out repeat until an airtight,191.87,4.89
seal is obtained and the red pressure,194.42,4.739
discharge indicator is not visible in,196.76,4.41
the pressure discharge window the green,199.159,3.481
digital indicator should remain,201.17,3.269
stationary to verify that there are no,202.64,4.079
air leaks and excess air is removed from,204.439,4.561
the system to enable greater patient,206.719,4.35
mobility you can secure the therapy,209.0,3.87
cartridge to the leg with the therapy,211.069,4.2
strap so as you can see the snap bridge,212.87,4.08
dressing is a good choice for patients,215.269,3.39
with wounds on the plantar surface of,216.95,3.569
the foot or other weight-bearing areas,218.659,3.48
where you're trying to minimize the,220.519,3.451
