you see them everywhere those little,14.7,4.62
pink blue and yellow packets of,17.369,4.17
artificial sweeteners you know they're,19.32,4.529
hyper sweet and calorie free but you,21.539,4.38
probably don't know what else the first,23.849,4.231
artificial sweeteners have in common,25.919,5.401
saccharine cyclamate aspartame although,28.08,5.49
their discoveries to lab workers who,31.32,3.92
didn't wash their hands,33.57,4.37
[Music],35.24,4.99
saccharin the one of the pink packets,37.94,6.34
was first 1897 Johns Hopkins University,40.23,6.72
graduate student Constantin Fahlberg was,44.28,4.89
working in his professor's lab trying to,46.95,4.86
find new uses for derivatives of coal,49.17,4.68
tar that's a waste product from,51.81,4.5
processing coal a primary fuel source at,53.85,5.58
the time after a hard day's work in the,56.31,6.57
chemistry lab foul bird goes home picks,59.43,5.909
up some bread for his dinner puts it to,62.88,4.14
his mouth and tastes something very very,65.339,5.07
sweet 300 times sweeter than sugar in,67.02,5.7
fact because he hadn't washed his hands,70.409,4.201
properly he'd literally brought his work,72.72,4.469
home with him tracing the taste back to,74.61,4.59
the lab he did something no one in,77.189,5.011
chemistry should ever do the only way to,79.2,5.61
figure out what was sweet on his lab,82.2,4.229
bench was literally to taste everything,84.81,4.86
and see what was sweet so he discovered,86.429,5.46
that he had over boiled a particular,89.67,5.0
beaker the sweetness came from that,91.889,5.25
Fahlberg had derived a compound from,94.67,6.28
coal tar called benzoic sulfide he named,97.139,5.281
it saccharin from the Latin word for,100.95,3.9
sugar and in fact saw its potential to,102.42,5.28
replace cane sugar the wonderful thing,104.85,4.89
about that official sweetness is that,107.7,3.689
you could produce as much as he wanted,109.74,2.129
to,111.389,3.811
you weren't limited by climate you,111.869,5.49
weren't limited by storms destroying,115.2,3.689
your crop you could create it in a,117.359,4.021
laboratory but was it safe to consume,118.889,5.16
what Fahlberg had created to find out he,121.38,4.349
did something else no one dealing with,124.049,4.171
chemicals should ever do Faubourg took,125.729,5.691
10 grams of saccharin swallowed it,128.22,5.849
waited for 24 hours to see what would,131.42,5.05
happen to him and he found that the,134.069,4.111
saccharin had basically gone straight,136.47,4.08
through him and was unmetabolized by his,138.18,4.38
body he decided saccharin was safe,140.55,4.049
because it had no effect on his body,142.56,4.47
there were between Fahlberg and his,144.599,3.72
professor dr. IRA REM,147.03,3.84
some some ugly clashes over credit for,148.319,4.26
discovery and development of that,150.87,3.899
substance before sacrum was finally,152.579,3.86
patented as a sugar substitute,154.769,4.47
especially good for diabetics because it,156.439,4.541
didn't metabolize it did not affect,159.239,4.2
blood sugar levels but there wasn't much,160.98,4.8
of a market for it it was a new product,163.439,5.101
and it had not a particularly nice,165.78,5.789
aftertaste so if you were used to sugar,168.54,4.649
and you had no problems with sugar you,171.569,3.48
weren't going to swap it for sugar in,173.189,4.83
most cases what happens in World War one,175.049,5.071
there is a sugar shortage so there is,178.019,4.05
actually a push to replace sugar with,180.12,4.41
saccharin as a way of showing your,182.069,4.53
patriotism you were saving sugar so,184.53,3.45
saccharin was used as a sweetener,186.599,4.98
instead Champa had several years 1937,187.98,5.64
university of illinois graduate student,191.579,3.961
michaels vada was trying to synthesize,193.62,5.22
an anti fever of medication he takes a,195.54,4.83
smoking break and of course when you're,198.84,4.349
smoking your hands come close to your,200.37,5.549
mouth and he tasted something very very,203.189,3.45
sweet,205.919,3.481
Speight had called it a cyclamate its,206.639,4.591
arrival on the market coincided with the,209.4,4.679
new popularity of low calorie diet sodas,211.23,5.849
in the 1950s for years cyclamate was in,214.079,5.94
high demand and broad use after tests,217.079,5.28
linked it to bladder cancer the FDA,220.019,4.74
banned it from the US market in 1969,222.359,4.65
although it's still used in more than 50,224.759,4.861
other countries in the u.s. a new,227.009,4.68
artificial sweetener was already in the,229.62,3.259
works,231.689,3.48
1965 the labs a pharmaceutical,232.879,5.44
manufacturer g-d cyril company chemist,235.169,4.981
james Schlatter was trying to synthesize,238.319,5.7
a new drug for gastric ulcers and in,240.15,5.609
another example of chemists who don't,244.019,3.93
wash their hands he had a break he went,245.759,4.111
outside and he tasted something very,247.949,4.921
very sweet on his hands and this was,249.87,6.51
what became aspartame aspartame the one,252.87,5.399
in the blue packets quickly became the,256.38,4.229
most used artificial sweetener in the,258.269,4.381
food and beverage industry worldwide and,260.609,4.351
still claims the largest share of the,262.65,4.92
artificial sweetener market as more,264.96,4.709
Americans gain weight and try to lose it,267.57,4.14
consumption of all artificial sweeteners,269.669,5.34
grows annually you don't have to give up,271.71,5.37
your sweet tooth you can still have as,275.009,4.171
many sweet things as you want but they,277.08,4.5
will now not give you calories,279.18,4.29
although new studies suggest they will,281.58,3.9
train our taste buds to prefer the hyper,283.47,4.44
sweet over natural sugars like those,285.48,5.94
found in fruit so that's the dirt on the,287.91,5.19
