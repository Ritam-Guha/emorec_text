diabetes affects the small blood vessels,0.08,3.44
all over your body,2.32,3.12
and the eye is sort of the canary in the,3.52,4.16
coal mine it's the first place that gets,5.44,3.16
into trouble,7.68,7.68
[Music],8.6,8.679
what happens is you get damage to blood,15.36,3.28
vessels and,17.279,2.961
the blood vessels in the eye you have,18.64,4.16
areas with lousy blood supply,20.24,4.799
those areas say i'm hungry i want more,22.8,3.12
blood supply,25.039,2.48
and they scream for help and what they,25.92,3.519
end up doing is making chemicals in the,27.519,2.801
eye,29.439,3.441
called cytokines that are well-meaning,30.32,4.239
it sounds like a great idea,32.88,3.519
they make new blood vessels grow they,34.559,3.84
make regular vessels leaky,36.399,3.761
but those new blood vessels have a,38.399,3.041
tendency to break,40.16,3.44
and bleed and scar down causing,41.44,3.36
blindness,43.6,2.959
that's what's called proliferative,44.8,3.599
diabetic retinopathy,46.559,3.761
diabetic retinopathy but new blood,48.399,3.121
vessels proliferate,50.32,3.84
the other major way diabetics lose,51.52,3.519
vision,54.16,3.28
is from this i'm hungry factor making,55.039,4.881
regular blood vessels swell and leak,57.44,4.24
and a swollen retina doesn't work well,59.92,3.68
just like a swollen brain doesn't think,61.68,3.519
well and a swollen knee doesn't work,63.6,2.08
well,65.199,2.481
fortunately we have made big,65.68,3.84
breakthroughs in the treatments of these,67.68,3.2
diseases,69.52,3.12
mainly by blocking that i'm hungry,70.88,3.919
factor there are several,72.64,5.6
erythropoietin hypoxia inducible factor,74.799,4.721
big names,78.24,4.64
and vegf vaso endothelial growth factor,79.52,5.68
vegf's the important one because we have,82.88,5.36
specific blockers for vegf,85.2,6.8
that have made a revolutionary change,88.24,6.16
in diabetics not going blind if they're,92.0,3.759
treated early enough,94.4,4.24
not only can using an anti-vegf stop the,95.759,5.04
i'm hungry factor and stop the new blood,98.64,3.92
vessels and help the swelling,100.799,4.081
it can also improve the overall blood,102.56,4.32
supply and circulation with continued,104.88,2.72
use,106.88,2.32
there are some patients that get,107.6,2.96
swelling in the retina and decrease,109.2,2.239
vision,110.56,2.64
but the brain is really good at ignoring,111.439,3.921
one-eyed problems and most patients that,113.2,3.279
get into that trouble,115.36,2.88
have denial issues of their own,116.479,4.0
certainly get a screening eye exam,118.24,4.239
with your local eye doctor who's used to,120.479,3.28
seeing retinas,122.479,3.201
doesn't have to be a world expert like,123.759,3.601
one of us,125.68,3.52
if they're signs of retinopathy you need,127.36,3.119
to be watched more closely,129.2,3.44
you want to be picked up at an annual,130.479,3.921
exam when you start to get these new,132.64,3.04
blood vessels,134.4,3.76
because if we can get you sooner we can,135.68,3.68
prevent,138.16,2.88
you know any of the potential vision,139.36,3.2
loss you might have had that otherwise,141.04,2.8
we'd have to save,142.56,3.679
with modern microsurgical techniques,143.84,4.08
we're able to pull some rabbits out of,146.239,2.241
the hat,147.92,2.48
take some totally blind patients and,148.48,3.119
recover,150.4,3.839
however it is much easier if you watch,151.599,4.0
those blood sugars,154.239,3.36
and and let us be in that first group of,155.599,3.28
patients,157.599,3.441
where we can take things slowly as,158.879,4.08
opposed to surgical intervention,161.04,4.88
or getting in stage disease with lots of,162.959,3.441
chronic,165.92,5.92
diabetic macular edema,166.4,5.44
you,172.72,2.08
