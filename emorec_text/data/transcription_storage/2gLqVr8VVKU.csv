hey guys it's michelle welcome back to,0.24,2.8
my channel,2.32,2.72
i'm here today with another type 1,3.04,3.759
diabetes video for you,5.04,3.68
if you are not subscribed to my channel,6.799,3.681
definitely do so down below,8.72,3.919
because i post a lot of type 1 diabetes,10.48,3.199
videos on here,12.639,4.001
including day in the life vlogs before i,13.679,4.641
start this video i just want to say that,16.64,2.24
i am not,18.32,2.959
a medical professional so if you have,18.88,4.479
any questions or concerns about your,21.279,2.561
health,23.359,2.481
definitely reach out to your own health,23.84,3.92
care provider i wanted to make this,25.84,3.199
video because,27.76,4.24
now it is more important than ever to,29.039,5.121
recognize the warning signs of type 1,32.0,3.12
diabetes,34.16,2.96
due to the pandemic a lot of people are,35.12,3.68
putting off going to see healthcare,37.12,4.24
providers in fear of coming into contact,38.8,3.36
with or even,41.36,3.76
catching covid19 even though there is a,42.16,3.36
risk,45.12,2.48
associated with going out to seek,45.52,3.84
medical attention it's really,47.6,3.92
important that you don't ignore any,49.36,3.6
symptoms that you're having,51.52,3.359
if you think that there's something off,52.96,3.759
with your body or there's something,54.879,2.241
wrong,56.719,2.64
it isn't worth the risk putting off,57.12,3.919
going to see your doctor,59.359,3.68
especially when it comes to something as,61.039,4.241
serious as type 1 diabetes,63.039,4.561
undiagnosed type 1 diabetes is very,65.28,3.12
dangerous,67.6,3.12
it can lead to a serious complication,68.4,3.039
known as,70.72,4.719
diabetic ketoacidosis also known as dka,71.439,6.161
which is where your blood essentially,75.439,3.601
turns acidic,77.6,3.04
and this can lead to swelling in your,79.04,3.92
brain and unfortunately,80.64,5.44
can lead to death so needless to say,82.96,4.96
it's really important to know these,86.08,3.999
warning signs of type 1 diabetes and,87.92,3.199
catch it early,90.079,2.801
early detection of type 1 diabetes can,91.119,4.96
also prevent unnecessary hospitalization,92.88,5.52
which will prevent you from contracting,96.079,4.08
kovid while in the hospital,98.4,3.6
so it's even more important now to know,100.159,3.6
the warning signs which is why i'm,102.0,2.72
making this video,103.759,2.801
before i start listing the warning signs,104.72,3.6
i have got to stress,106.56,5.599
that type 1 diabetes can happen anytime,108.32,6.32
and by that i mean it does not matter,112.159,3.681
how old you are,114.64,3.519
i personally know a lot of people type 1,115.84,4.48
diabetes who are diagnosed as an adult,118.159,4.64
in their 30s 40s 50s 60s there's a,120.32,4.079
misconception out there that type 1,122.799,3.6
diabetes is only diagnosed in children,124.399,4.0
and that's just simply not true,126.399,4.0
so these warning signs that i'm about to,128.399,4.161
go through in this video are for anyone,130.399,4.48
okay warning sign number one excessive,132.56,4.72
thirst i personally did not have this,134.879,5.36
warning sign but my friends who did have,137.28,4.72
it who are living with type 1 diabetes,140.239,4.72
now described it as unquenchable thirst,142.0,3.68
so,144.959,2.481
you're thirsty you drink a big glass of,145.68,3.76
water and you still feel thirsty after,147.44,3.76
no matter how much you drink you just,149.44,4.079
cannot quench your thirst,151.2,4.24
which leads me to warning sign number,153.519,4.481
two frequent urination,155.44,5.439
so i mean those two kind of go hand in,158.0,4.239
hand you're drinking a lot you're peeing,160.879,1.921
a lot,162.239,2.72
the kidneys are also working in overload,162.8,3.84
too when your blood sugar is high,164.959,4.081
some people even report bedwetting,166.64,4.319
before being diagnosed with type 1 just,169.04,4.0
because you have to pee so frequently,170.959,3.041
that,173.04,3.04
can't hold it in at night warning sign,174.0,3.04
number three is,176.08,2.96
unexplained weight loss and this i,177.04,4.0
actually did have before i was diagnosed,179.04,3.52
with type 1 diabetes but,181.04,3.36
it was subtle my family and i didn't,182.56,3.44
really notice it and,184.4,4.559
the fourth most common warning sign of,186.0,4.239
type 1 diabetes,188.959,2.961
would be exhaustion you don't have,190.239,3.521
enough insulin in your body you're not,191.92,3.44
using the food to create,193.76,4.0
energy so you're going to be exhausted,195.36,4.08
and tired all the time so if you're,197.76,2.32
someone,199.44,2.4
who normally has a lot of energy and now,200.08,3.68
you find that you need naps to get,201.84,3.2
through the day,203.76,3.119
that could be a warning sign so those,205.04,3.68
are the four most common,206.879,4.08
early warning signs of type 1 diabetes,208.72,3.68
now i just want to tell you guys about,210.959,2.961
mine i'm not going to go through,212.4,3.6
my full diagnosis story because it's,213.92,3.039
rather long,216.0,2.319
but if you want to see the whole thing,216.959,3.041
i'm going to put it up here a link to,218.319,2.48
that video,220.0,3.84
so my first warning sign was oral thrush,220.799,5.601
which is a fungal infection in your,223.84,4.0
mouth and throat,226.4,4.479
cool right tmi maybe but that was my,227.84,4.88
first warning sign i got that,230.879,3.761
about maybe a couple months before i was,232.72,3.28
diagnosed and,234.64,2.799
it kind of makes sense because if your,236.0,2.799
blood sugar is running higher you're,237.439,3.281
more prone to an infection like that,238.799,4.08
and then the warning sign that made my,240.72,3.04
mom take me,242.879,3.36
into the doctor's office which i'm not,243.76,4.32
even sure if this was a warning sign but,246.239,3.441
i felt like i needed to pee,248.08,4.799
a lot um i had the urge to urinate but,249.68,5.68
then when i went to use the washroom,252.879,5.441
i didn't have to that's one warning sign,255.36,4.399
that i haven't heard other people,258.32,3.92
really have but that is the warning sign,259.759,4.401
that made me go into the doctor and,262.24,3.84
eventually get my type 1 diabetes,264.16,2.72
diagnosis,266.08,2.88
so i had some uncommon symptoms but i,266.88,3.599
just want to share them with you guys,268.96,2.239
because,270.479,2.801
those are some symptoms that you don't,271.199,3.841
see as much or you don't hear,273.28,3.84
about as much so now i want to hear from,275.04,3.76
you guys if you have been diagnosed with,277.12,4.16
type 1 diabetes what were your symptoms,278.8,4.48
leave them in the comments down below,281.28,3.919
because it'd be great for someone who's,283.28,3.6
concerned maybe to see what your,285.199,2.961
symptoms were,286.88,3.28
and hear from other people living with,288.16,4.479
type 1 diabetes other than myself,290.16,4.56
and that's it for this video if you are,292.639,3.601
watching this from home,294.72,3.28
and you seriously think you might have,296.24,3.2
type 1 diabetes,298.0,3.199
give your health care provider a phone,299.44,3.84
call it's just a quick phone call to see,301.199,3.921
whether or not you need to be tested and,303.28,4.08
the test is so simple it's just a finger,305.12,2.96
prick,307.36,2.8
and it can save your life i am also,308.08,3.119
going to be leaving,310.16,3.28
a really great resource from beyond type,311.199,3.601
