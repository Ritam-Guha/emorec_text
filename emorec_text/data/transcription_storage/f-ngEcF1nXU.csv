so when you have a patient with / if,12.259,7.58
Aarthi there are a number of treatment,16.96,6.45
options to deal with that the main,19.839,6.03
treatment option is medication which,23.41,7.05
I've dealt with in another video there,25.869,5.761
are also advanced pain management,30.46,4.44
procedures but there's treatments which,31.63,6.389
is called radiofrequency treatments now,34.9,5.13
when you're faced with a patient with,38.019,4.081
peripheral neuropathy who's not,40.03,5.52
responding to medication for example or,42.1,4.979
they're getting a lot of excessive,45.55,3.629
adverse effects with medication and so,47.079,4.591
they can no longer take them this is,49.179,4.29
what we would refer to as a minimally,51.67,4.529
invasive pain management procedure which,53.469,6.77
we use in order to improve the situation,56.199,6.93
now the majority of patients who have,60.239,5.531
peripheral neuropathy the pain that they,63.129,4.681
experience will be in their feet in,65.77,4.92
their foot and ankle usually on both,67.81,6.449
sides now there are nerves that come out,70.69,6.09
from the lower part of the back usually,74.259,6.301
the l5 and the s-1 nerve roots these are,76.78,6.0
the big nerves which come out right at,80.56,4.23
the bottom of the back and essentially,82.78,4.92
travel down and ultimately will supply,84.79,8.369
nerve supply to the feet one treatment,87.7,7.529
option that we have that can be very,93.159,5.341
successful is to bring the patient into,95.229,6.481
hospital as a day case we would put them,98.5,5.82
under an x-ray a little bit of very,101.71,5.4
light sedation so feel nice and relaxed,104.32,7.11
and then we put a tiny little probe down,107.11,9.57
to the nerve root so in this procedure,111.43,7.77
the two main targets that we're looking,116.68,5.34
for are right at the bottom of the spine,119.2,6.269
here we're looking at the l5 there's a,122.02,5.309
nerve root which comes out at this level,125.469,4.71
the l5 level and there's one below it,127.329,5.13
which comes out of the sacrum which is,130.179,5.011
that what we call the s-1 level now,132.459,4.771
these are the two nerve roots which,135.19,4.47
essentially supply most of the nerve,137.23,6.24
supply to the feet and ankle when,139.66,6.509
patients have peripheral neuropathy we,143.47,5.19
will put a tiny probe it's known as a,146.169,4.261
radiofrequency probe,148.66,4.71
that is put down to the l5 nerve root,150.43,6.479
and to the s-1 nerve root those,153.37,5.819
electrodes are then connected to a,156.909,5.461
radiofrequency machine we put a small,159.189,6.27
electrical current through to test the,162.37,4.589
nerve to make sure that we're in the,165.459,3.87
right place and the patient will,166.959,4.471
essentially experience a dull pulsing,169.329,4.621
sensation and then we just very very,171.43,5.85
carefully move the probes until we get,173.95,7.259
exactly the area of coverage where the,177.28,5.789
patient's experiencing the worst of,181.209,6.36
their pain now once we've achieved that,183.069,7.95
using a smaller current as possible we,187.569,6.06
would then put cycles of an electrical,191.019,7.231
current through the electrodes into the,193.629,7.351
nerve roots in order to try and reset,198.25,5.25
the nerves and make them function,200.98,6.06
properly so as I said this treatment is,203.5,6.48
called pulsed radiofrequency in this,207.04,5.94
case pulsed radiofrequency to the lower,209.98,6.509
lumbar nerve roots the actual treatment,212.98,6.36
itself usually lasts for between two to,216.489,4.801
three minutes it can be done for longer,219.34,4.859
the most important thing is that this,221.29,5.97
treatment is non-destructive so we're,224.199,4.981
not damaging the nerves we're not,227.26,4.559
cutting the nerves we're not irritating,229.18,5.639
limit in any way we're actually using a,231.819,5.551
type of electrical treatment called,234.819,5.79
radiofrequency to try and reset the,237.37,5.28
nerves and make them work properly,240.609,3.571
and make them work in a normal,242.65,4.679
functioning pattern in terms of risks,244.18,5.279
and benefits the benefits of the,247.329,5.22
procedure are pain relief it will take,249.459,5.34
approximately 10 to 14 days to work,252.549,5.25
sometimes less sometimes more in terms,254.799,4.321
of risks,257.799,3.87
these are failure local bleeding,259.12,5.94
bruising infection discomfort you may,261.669,5.131
get some numbness weakness pins and,265.06,3.69
needles afterwards for a few hours and,266.8,4.5
"about one in 2,000 people may experience",268.75,6.03
a headache after the procedure in terms,271.3,6.66
of the overall success rates we're,274.78,5.699
usually looking at approximately 65,277.96,5.88
percent chance of success of reducing,280.479,3.84
the pay,283.84,4.229
by a minimum of 40% for at least six to,284.319,7.53
nine months the procedures if they're,288.069,7.77
effective can be repeated and often we,291.849,5.641
will have patients who will have the,295.839,4.05
procedure done approximately once or,297.49,4.649
twice a year that will keep their,299.889,5.28
symptoms under good control and once we,302.139,4.74
have those symptoms under control the,305.169,3.571
great thing is that if they are on any,306.879,4.32
other medication it may be possible to,308.74,5.009
cut down on that medication which may be,311.199,5.821
giving them side effects and they can,313.749,7.37
get on with things much more easily,317.02,4.099
