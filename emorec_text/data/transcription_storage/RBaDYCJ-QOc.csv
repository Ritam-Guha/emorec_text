hello dr. Burke here in this video we're,0.0,3.179
going to talk about peripheral,2.1,3.21
neuropathy now we're going to relate,3.179,3.631
this to diabetes there's other,5.31,2.85
conditions that you can have it as well,6.81,4.47
but what is it basically the sensation,8.16,7.38
of pain burning pain numbness numbness,11.28,7.44
and tingling or any combination thereof,15.54,6.899
on your hands or your feet okay and so,18.72,5.79
what happens in diabetes it's one of the,22.439,4.26
symptoms that you want to watch out for,24.51,4.14
when you start experiencing that it's,26.699,3.871
starting to advance a little bit too,28.65,3.81
deep in the body now the reason why it's,30.57,3.57
affecting the hands and the feet first,32.46,3.75
is simply because those nerves are the,34.14,4.079
longest so if you envision having this,36.21,5.369
tube of carrying oxygen and nutrition,38.219,5.761
the very end of that tube is going to,41.579,4.861
experience the deficiency burst right,43.98,4.02
because it has to go all the way over,46.44,2.7
there same thing with the hands in the,48.0,4.8
feet now what causes this is the high,49.14,7.559
levels of sugar in the blood causing,52.8,7.14
micro vascular injury the body does not,56.699,6.871
like too much sugar it's toxic so it,59.94,7.59
creates very small arterial or vascular,63.57,7.77
injury to the nervous system so the,67.53,7.11
blood vessels that feed the nerves,71.34,5.76
get disrupted okay that's number one,74.64,4.409
number two glycated end-products now,77.1,3.839
what is that that's just another,79.049,3.901
mechanism that you have this protein,80.939,3.36
that's building up because the high,82.95,3.989
sugar on the nerves stopping the flow of,84.299,6.0
nerve impulses okay number three vitamin,86.939,6.0
b12 deficiency or vitamin b1 deficiency,90.299,6.451
okay both of those vitamins control the,92.939,7.201
synthesis of mild in around the nerve,96.75,5.85
myelin is the kind of the fat insulator,100.14,4.14
of the nerve just like if you had a wire,102.6,3.75
you have this plastic or rubber,104.28,5.61
insulation myelin is the fat insulation,106.35,5.129
around the nerve well if you don't have,109.89,3.57
the b12 or the b1 you're not going to,111.479,3.361
make the insulation so that's going to,113.46,2.519
go away so you're going to start,114.84,3.029
short-circuiting that electrical flow,115.979,4.5
and start getting all sorts of nerve,117.869,6.231
issues okay so now what is the solution,120.479,6.56
well number one you've got to fix the,124.1,5.139
sugar problem which is an insulin,127.039,3.401
problem I'm going to put some links down,129.239,3.891
below and secondly you,130.44,5.18
need to start taking b12 and b1 I would,133.13,4.89
get those in a fat soluble form in,135.62,4.47
addition to that you want to also,138.02,6.17
consume nutritional yeast because,140.09,6.36
diabetics or people that are,144.19,4.06
pre-diabetics tend to always have,146.45,3.81
deficiencies of these two vitamins and a,148.25,3.78
lot of other ones so you need a little,150.26,3.75
bit more nutritional yeast you can get,152.03,3.75
it from any health food store all right,154.01,3.57
thanks for watching hey if you haven't,155.78,3.96
already subscribed press this little,157.58,6.47
button down below okay thanks,159.74,4.31
