[burps]",0.62,1.21
"pardon me,
it was not me,",1.83,3.64
"it was,
gastroparesis,",5.47,1.82
"it was the wind coming back up to say hello,
that's not a song...",7.29,3.53
[intro music],10.82,3.9
"Well hello everybody and welcome back to my
channel",14.96,2.4
"or if you're new
hello welcome to my channel, my name is Sophie.",17.37,3.74
Today we are talking about Gastroparesis.,21.11,2.54
What is Gastroparesis I hear some of you say?,23.65,2.03
"Well I mean the real question is why haven't
you",25.68,2.34
watched this video from my channel?,28.02,1.97
"No, I'm just kidding, if you don't know what
Gastroparesis is be sure to pause this",29.99,4.17
"video right now,
go watch my video,",34.16,2.69
"learn about Gastroparesis and then come on
over back.",36.85,2.66
"So having been diagnosed with Gastroparesis
for 6 or 7 years",39.51,4.7
"I think it is now,
I still find myself having questions and",44.21,4.469
"searching online on youtube on blog posts
for answers.",48.679,4.2
"I figured I would sit down and answer some
questions that I received",52.879,4.2
"or I have ever wondered
and you know answer the ones that I feel I",57.079,4.831
"have enough
knowledge about and enough experience about",61.91,2.649
"so that you guys never feel alone and you
have",64.559,2.781
a place to come when you need some answers.,67.34,2.47
So let's crack on with the questions.,69.81,2.63
"Also before we get into the questions,
I just want to remind you or even let you",72.44,3.791
"know if you don't know,
there are so many people and support groups",76.231,4.269
"and even charities (Gift UK, just saying)
that are there to support you and help you",80.5,7.96
"and answer your questions and just be someone
who can truly understand what you're going",88.46,5.61
through.,94.07,1.0
"So I will leave the link to any information
that I know of or that I use,",95.07,4.63
"but honestly just go on Facebook and type
in",99.7,3.18
"Gastroparesis support group and you will find
a ton.",102.88,3.75
"Ok so the first question is,
as part of my dad's support system how best",106.63,2.98
can we support him on his worst days?,109.61,2.19
"I know this isn't the answer that you want
to hear,",111.8,2.83
"but honestly there’s really not that much
you can do to make it feel better.",114.63,6.68
um..,121.31,1.0
"There’s no cream or plaster that you can
put on",122.31,3.05
"and you know you feel you know you feel yourself
again.",125.36,3.89
"However i know i can be a bit of a moody *****
when I’m having a really really really bad",129.25,5.8
"day,
so from your point of you view,",135.05,3.49
"so don’t take anything he may say or do
personally or to hear and get upset",138.54,7.179
"because he probably doesn’t mean it and
it’s just his emotions all kind of spiralling",145.719,7.22
"and going crazy but other than that,
honestly i just find you know, being with",152.939,6.3
someone or being distracted helps.,159.239,3.741
"I do find distraction to be one of the best
medicines so you know just sit with him, watch",162.98,6.289
"a movie, chat,
you know talk about random stuff,",169.269,4.611
"try and make him laugh,
just being there helps more than you’ll",173.88,4.029
"ever know
because the feeling you get when people suddenly",177.909,4.34
"disappear
and leave you because you’re not feeling",182.249,2.36
"well
and you have this condition is such a horrible",184.609,3.33
"feeling
so just having you there and seeing you know,",187.939,4.241
"you’re by his side is just it helps than
than than you realize honestly.",192.18,7.33
"Question number 2, what was it like having
a feeding tube?",199.51,4.67
It really isn’t as bad as it may seem.,204.18,4.41
"I have had both a nj tube and a pegj tube
and",208.59,4.789
"that is a nasal jejunal tube and the pegj
goes through your stomach wall and",213.379,4.12
"although I had quite a lot of problems with
the pegj tube,",217.499,3.371
"that was more down to my EDS and the healing
of my skin,",220.87,3.799
"rather than the tube and the way the tube
works itself if that makes sense.",224.669,5.88
"To me they are life savers and they took pressure
off of me to have to eat",230.549,6.181
"because I was getting the nutrients I needed
so i could just eat small bits here and",236.73,4.759
"there for flavor and to feel normal I guess
or just use my jaw muscles so they don’t",241.489,6.121
"tighten up but it took that pressure off,
so I didn’t feel oh I have to eat,",247.61,6.669
"now I’m going to get a lot of pain
and I’m gong to have a lot of suffering",254.279,3.151
"and
it took away that kind of fear and hate of",257.43,4.49
"food in a way
and I mean plus who can say they can sleep",261.92,3.499
"and eat all at the same time
or that it is totally acceptable to go to",265.419,3.9
"the toilet whilst eating
I mean you can’t do that.",269.319,4.57
"I mean I feel like this is a topic that could
be like a while video,",273.889,3.671
"so I don’t know if you want me to do like
a whole video",277.56,2.43
"on my experiences of tube feeing and my kind
of tips and tricks",279.99,4.73
"and stuff like that if you do be sure to let
me know in the comments below.",284.72,3.4
"Ok next up do you have a safe option food?
and I will be 100% honest with you and say",288.12,7.61
no.,295.73,1.39
"i used to but now I kind of,
I can eat something one day and be relatively",297.12,5.72
"ok
and then I’ll have it the next day and be",302.84,3.9
less than ok..,306.74,1.37
"I have things that I know will always cause
me more pain like pasta",308.11,5.92
"I know to stay clear of unless I am willing
to not be able to move for a long time",314.03,5.96
"and get very bloated
and i know red meats tend to cause more pain.",319.99,3.63
"so,
no,",323.62,1.0
"certain foods tend to cause more pain but
i don’t have like a safe option go-to meal",324.62,6.87
"that isn’t going to hurt so yeah…
sadly gastroparesis is very unpredictable",331.49,8.149
"so you may be ok one day but you might not
the next day",339.639,3.78
"but then I also know people that do have safe
option foods,",343.419,3.411
"so I mean everyone’s different,
but for me personally, I don’t have one",346.83,6.36
"anymore, but I used to.",353.19,1.58
"potatoe and tuna used to be a really good
one.",354.77,1.85
Has the gastric pace-maker helped?,356.62,2.18
"It has helped with my nausea, i don’t spend
half my life over a toilet bowl any more.",358.8,6.94
"It hasn’t helped the pain, however,
we were told going into it it is primarily",365.74,4.459
for sickness.,370.199,2.22
"Would i get it again knowing what i know now
about it?",372.419,3.46
yes.,375.879,1.0
"I do still take anti-sickness medication,
its not you know a magic cure.",376.879,6.701
it helps to a degree.,383.58,1.48
"I do wonder if it has sped up you know, emptying
system",385.06,5.44
"because I haven’t had an emptying test in
a while",390.5,2.27
"so I do wonder if it has you know sped things
up down there.",392.77,5.09
"Ok so this is kind of a 2 in 1 question the
question is,",397.86,2.59
"how do you deal with family and friends meals
out and with the being excluded from things?",400.45,7.55
"I feel like this is maybe a topic for a separate
video",408.0,3.729
"because this is something that everyone with
gasroparesis will deal with",411.729,5.28
and it is not easy.,417.009,2.231
um…,419.24,1.0
"I’m not even gonna sugar coat it,
it is hard and even now I sometimes find it",420.24,8.28
"hard
especially if I’m going through a bad phase.",428.52,4.329
"it isn’t easy being isolated
and excluded from things",432.849,3.181
"and when you do go to a restaurant or you
get asked to,",436.03,4.27
"you kind of feel very awkward and i don’t
really ever go out to eat at restaurants.",440.3,7.26
"it is very very rare hat you will ever see
me in a restaurant.",447.56,4.56
"Take aways will be like your best friend,
so find someone who is willing to just chill",452.12,5.43
"at home,
in your jimmies with a take-away",457.55,3.269
"and help you deal with the consequences after
basically.",460.819,3.06
"But like no it isn’t easy and there is no
easy way to deal with that",463.879,9.04
"because being isolated and excluded from things
isn’t easy.",472.919,4.541
"Because people will start to stop asking you
or you’re saying no so many times they just",477.46,6.54
"won’t bother
and it’s hard but in a way you also find",484.0,5.59
out who your real friends are.,489.59,2.32
"The ones willing to change things and adapt
things",491.91,3.09
"and do things maybe a little bit differently,
they’re the ones that you want anyway is",495.0,4.24
how i try and look at it.,499.24,1.519
What has gastroparesis taught you?,500.759,1.761
"It has taught me a lot of things but probably
the main two would be,",502.52,4.41
"to appreciate the things we do have in life,
so especially like the basic things that we",506.93,7.07
"just take for granted
that help us survive like food,",514.0,4.07
"water,
a bed to sleep on,",518.07,3.209
"like all of these things we take for granted
and I did it before i would just eat and eat",521.279,7.141
"and eat and didn’t even think twice about
it",528.42,1.51
"or think to be grateful for it I just did
it like it was an every day thing.",529.93,6.43
"no consequences,
wasn’t grateful for it or appreciative of",536.36,5.71
"it
and yeah I’ve just learnt to really appreciate",542.07,3.66
"the things in life
particularly the basic things that we have",545.73,6.08
every single day.,551.81,1.49
"And the second thing would be,
it also taught me who my real friends are",553.3,3.849
"and who the people are that I really want
in my life",557.149,3.49
"and who will stick by me no matter what
and yeah I think those are probably the main",560.639,7.491
two things.,568.13,1.0
"Ok I could go on answering questions for literally
ages,",569.13,5.12
"however I’m pretty sure y’all probably
have things",574.25,2.53
"that you would like to do or need to do that
don’t include watching me.",576.78,4.89
"So I hope this video helped answer even maybe
one of your questions,",581.67,4.53
"if you do have anymore questions about gastroparesis,
be it from a sufferer or someone who is around",586.2,6.54
"a sufferer,
be sure to let me know in the comments below",592.74,2.8
"and maybe I will do a part 2
of this video because,",595.54,2.97
"I know for me watching videos of other people
and their experiences with things, helped",598.51,7.079
"me a lot more
than just reading it on medical websites and",605.589,3.411
stuff.,609.0,1.0
"If you did like this video or found it helpful,
be sure to give it a massive thumbs up",610.0,4.82
"and if you have just been diagnosed with gastroparesis
or you know someone who just has,",614.82,4.81
"remember you are not alone, you are in this
together",619.63,3.23
and you now have a new family to hug… weird?,622.86,3.82
Yeah.,626.68,1.0
"And if you’re not already I would love for
you to hit that subscribe button,",627.68,3.659
"it would mean so much to me and I would be
very very grateful",631.339,4.351
and appreciative if you did.,635.69,1.94
"I will also leave the link to my last video
in the description box below",637.63,3.06
"in case you wanna go check that one out which
i think you do.",640.69,4.44
"and until next time,
keep watching,",645.13,1.709
"stay strong
and stay safe,",646.839,1.641
bye guys!,648.48,1.17
"But to me actually it feels like even more
of an….",649.65,4.45
