hello everyone today I am here to share,15.46,5.079
some information about the most common,18.47,5.91
complaint I get to see in my obd namely,20.539,7.291
polycystic ovarian syndrome polycystic,24.38,6.139
ovarian syndrome is characterized by,27.83,6.659
irregular menstrual cycles by renaming,30.519,6.43
irregular menstrual cycles I mean and it,34.489,4.051
can range anytime anywhere between,36.949,4.5
absent menstrual cycles to prolong,38.54,5.85
menstrual cycles to irregular menstrual,41.449,6.061
cycles anything like that and it is,44.39,5.61
characterized by infertility this is one,47.51,4.35
of the most important cause for the,50.0,4.53
female infertility hurting it is,51.86,6.87
characterized by obesity and there is,54.53,7.38
increased facial hair growth and they,58.73,5.94
have the oily skin and they also have a,61.91,3.599
thick,64.67,3.21
velvety patchy dark and kind of skin,65.509,4.441
mostly near the neck and it is called as,67.88,5.73
acanthosis nigricans in medical terms so,69.95,6.48
what causes this polycystic ovarian,73.61,5.43
syndrome the exact cause is not known,76.43,5.18
but what we can hypothesize is it is an,79.04,6.78
amalgamation of genetic factors and the,81.61,7.09
lifestyle factors there is increased,85.82,5.189
androgens and insulin resistance in the,88.7,4.04
body of the women who suffer from,91.009,5.07
polycystic ovaries so what is this,92.74,5.83
insulin resistance until resistance,96.079,5.941
means that the body is not sensitive to,98.57,5.549
the amount of insulin which is being,102.02,3.87
produced in their body so the body is,104.119,4.411
forced produce more insulin to keep the,105.89,6.24
same glucose under check so what are,108.53,5.79
this androgens androgens are the male,112.13,4.98
hormones which are there in a normal,114.32,5.22
female also to an extent but in these,117.11,5.25
women the androgen levels are so much,119.54,4.53
more that they start having increased,122.36,4.71
facial hair growth and oily skin and all,124.07,6.509
that so what can this polycystic ovarian,127.07,8.16
syndrome cause as I told you it causes,130.579,6.571
infertility because of the increased,135.23,4.62
androgens it prevents egg getting renews,137.15,4.679
every month that affects the menstrual,139.85,3.24
cycles and,141.829,5.341
also causes infertility in this women so,143.09,6.3
what are the long-term health risks of,147.17,5.19
this polycystic ovary syndrome usually I,149.39,4.86
told you immediately it causes irregular,152.36,4.83
cycles and infertility but only,154.25,4.83
long-term because it causes irregular,157.19,3.18
menstrual cycle it is one of the most,159.08,3.57
important risk factors for endometrial,160.37,4.71
cancer at a later date and I told you it,162.65,5.4
causes a infinite resistance so it can,165.08,5.43
lead to type 2 diabetes at a later date,168.05,4.86
and since it also causes obesity with an,170.51,3.54
important risk factors for,172.91,4.079
cardiovascular risk diseases at a later,174.05,6.09
date so how do we treat this polycystic,176.989,6.211
ovary syndrome usually the treatment is,180.14,6.179
targeted at the requirement of the women,183.2,5.52
the treatment is usually tailored toward,186.319,4.771
the need of the women usually are young,188.72,4.89
female who just wants regularization in,191.09,4.11
the cycle we put them on oral,193.61,3.39
contraceptive pills the oral,195.2,3.569
contraceptive pills keeps the harmonics,197.0,4.26
under control it regularizes the cycle,198.769,6.121
also radio sister and Regent suppose the,201.26,6.81
woman requires to get pregnant then we,204.89,5.909
put her on fertility treatment and most,208.07,6.57
important single most important factor,210.799,5.641
which can improve the polycystic ovary,214.64,4.469
syndrome is weight loss weight loss goes,216.44,4.71
in our are making the polycystic ovary,219.109,6.0
syndrome a little better I hope you got,221.15,6.24
at least a bird's eye view of what the,225.109,6.861
polycystic ovary syndrome is thank you,227.39,4.58
