hello my name is dr. Simon fryer,0.11,4.95
consultants in clinical neurophysiology,2.85,4.529
this video will provide you with an,5.06,4.209
explanation of how diabetic neuropathy,7.379,4.291
is currently treated you can also find,9.269,4.711
out more information about how diabetic,11.67,4.23
neuropathy develops and different types,13.98,4.139
of this condition in a separate video by,15.9,6.139
clicking on the information card above,18.119,3.92
firstly to be very clear there are no,22.279,5.141
magical cures for these conditions there,24.779,4.92
are no particular food substances,27.42,4.529
vitamins or exercises that will provide,29.699,4.981
an immediate cure there is no evidence,31.949,4.711
for any of the alternative medicine,34.68,4.76
cures such as homeopathy Reiki,36.66,6.21
reflexology laser therapy magnets or,39.44,5.29
crystals in helping to treat any of,42.87,3.81
these conditions the single biggest,44.73,3.57
driver of these neuropathies is,46.68,3.87
hyperglycemia which means raise blood,48.3,5.61
sugar levels it is vital that optimal,50.55,5.16
blood sugar levels are achieved as soon,53.91,5.34
as possible having the right diet with,55.71,5.13
control sugar intake will form a,59.25,3.39
significant basis of your treatment,60.84,3.959
together with any of the blood sugar,62.64,5.159
lowering agency might be prescribed this,64.799,5.25
should help stop the underlying disease,67.799,4.68
causing processes from continuing I will,70.049,4.381
allow the nerves to gradually start to,72.479,6.39
heal themselves this is not an instant,74.43,6.6
cure and can take a long time maybe even,78.869,4.531
months or years hence prevention of this,81.03,4.53
is best and you're diabetic nurse and,83.4,4.079
doctors should be actively screening,85.56,3.9
patients for this to catch it early and,87.479,5.011
prevent it from becoming bad the next,89.46,4.799
step of treatment is to consider,92.49,5.489
adequate symptom control for patients,94.259,5.731
who have painful diabetic neuropathy,97.979,3.96
this will need medications to reduce,99.99,4.53
nerve pain of course these have no place,101.939,4.14
in treating patients for the painless,104.52,4.739
neuropathy in England are nice,106.079,5.82
guidelines recommend certain medications,109.259,6.9
to reduce nerve pain first-line agents,111.899,5.851
prescribed in the community setting,116.159,4.201
starts with duloxetine if this cannot be,117.75,4.38
taken or is not helpful than,120.36,3.63
amitriptyline and pregabalin are,122.13,4.739
recommended as second-line agents if,123.99,5.1
these are not sufficiently helpful it's,126.869,4.561
more specialized advice will be required,129.09,4.5
and perhaps certain medication,131.43,5.22
such as opioids lidocaine capsaicin or,133.59,5.16
even spinal cord stimulators might be,136.65,6.66
required patients with autonomic,138.75,6.87
symptoms may require medicines to help,143.31,4.05
stabilize blood pressure if they feel,145.62,4.199
dizzy when they stand up patients may,147.36,4.23
also need to modify how quickly they,149.819,4.081
stand up and might even benefit from leg,151.59,5.85
compression stockings too if the pacing,153.9,5.58
of the heart is affected regular heart,157.44,4.74
check-ups become important and patients,159.48,4.41
might need medications to help regulate,162.18,4.169
their heart rates patients with sexual,163.89,4.89
dysfunctions might require treatments to,166.349,4.291
improve erectile dysfunction in men and,168.78,5.069
lubrication in women dietary changes,170.64,4.92
might also be required if the gut,173.849,4.591
motility is affected and also certain,175.56,6.33
medications might also be necessary the,178.44,5.18
next step is preventing complications,181.89,4.95
from the neuropathy for those who view,183.62,5.35
sensation in their feeds also prevention,186.84,4.44
is critical in reducing foot infections,188.97,6.06
gangrene and amputations professional,191.28,5.88
nail care forms an important part of,195.03,5.12
this if patients find themselves having,197.16,5.729
difficulty with their balance because of,200.15,5.35
this I usually tend to recommend that,202.889,3.961
they keep the lights on in their,205.5,3.299
hallways on the way to the bathroom at,206.85,5.37
night this can help to reduce Falls the,208.799,4.891
final aspect I would like to introduce,212.22,4.049
our disease modifying agents these,213.69,4.26
represent the latest treatments which,216.269,3.421
are still being evaluated with mixed,217.95,4.53
results being reported so far after,219.69,4.53
these reductase inhibitors or Harry's,222.48,3.569
have been tried over the last 20 years,224.22,4.41
these reduce metabolism of sugars,226.049,4.77
through the polyol pathways if you,228.63,4.289
recall in the other video these calls,230.819,3.45
are built up a fructose and sucrose,232.919,3.781
inside nerve cells which causes them to,234.269,5.431
swell and become damaged unfortunately,236.7,5.129
only limited effects have been shown,239.7,4.71
with these alpha lipoic acid has also,241.829,4.41
been used with some benefit but requires,244.41,4.259
intravenous treatments for many days at,246.239,4.291
a time over a number of months and so is,248.669,5.07
not a great practical benefit carnitine,250.53,4.53
has also been shown to have some,253.739,3.93
beneficial effects but side effects have,255.06,4.679
make this a poorly tolerated treatment,257.669,4.231
more excitingly and much more,259.739,3.601
practically there has been a recent,261.9,2.32
realized,263.34,2.47
that hypertension or raise blood,264.22,3.66
pressure plays an important role in the,265.81,4.7
formation of diabetic neuropathy,267.88,4.71
antihypertensives from the ACE inhibitor,270.51,4.48
class such as trandolapril have been,272.59,3.75
shown to reduce the blood vessel,274.99,3.48
thickening caused by diabetes are,276.34,4.23
significantly improved start letting,278.47,4.68
neuropathy over 12 months I hope that,280.57,4.41
this video has provided you with a,283.15,3.63
useful overview of current treatments,284.98,4.4
available,286.78,2.6
