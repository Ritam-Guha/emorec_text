actually i snuck in a third case i was,3.12,4.0
pretty bad which hopefully i won't get,5.359,3.681
into too much trouble but essentially,7.12,3.519
you know during our case presentations,9.04,3.2
myself and my colleagues we kind of took,10.639,4.321
different topics with cll patients,12.24,5.2
i took uh treatment naive older,14.96,6.079
individuals with cll so we looked at a,17.44,6.96
patient who had comorbid illnesses but,21.039,4.641
also,24.4,4.44
was a tp53 mutated patient and an,25.68,6.879
unmutated ighv so essentially i kind of,28.84,5.719
highlighted data looking at how to treat,32.559,4.16
individuals in that scenario and so we,34.559,4.641
actually updated given the updated data,36.719,4.881
with resonate two so right so ibrutinib,39.2,4.8
versus chloramber cell looking at that,41.6,4.639
nice you know seven-year follow-up with,44.0,4.16
a very nice progression-free survival,46.239,4.48
for patients at seven years very,48.16,4.559
encouraging data sort of shows,50.719,4.0
highlights sort of the efficacy,52.719,4.0
there in treatment naive patients who,54.719,3.201
are older,56.719,2.561
and in addition,57.92,3.6
with patients who are started on a btk,59.28,4.64
inhibitor it was like the nice long,61.52,4.8
follow-up to suggest that patients who,63.92,4.64
maintain therapy over time their,66.32,4.799
responses also increase over time so,68.56,4.4
complete remissions typically when you,71.119,3.601
start a btk inhibit are usually in the,72.96,4.72
single digits um but now we were seeing,74.72,5.039
you know patients who uh you know seven,77.68,3.68
years their their complete remission,79.759,4.241
response increases to like 34,81.36,4.48
so again sort of highlighting some of,84.0,4.32
that data um you know that long-term,85.84,5.76
data in addition uh i also highlighted a,88.32,4.96
little bit about because these were all,91.6,4.24
updates at the recent congresses updates,93.28,4.4
with elevate tn so looking at,95.84,4.959
acalabrutinib plus or minus obinutuzumab,97.68,4.2
versus,100.799,2.881
chlorambicillinobinituzumab and again,101.88,4.599
favoring the ocalabutinib arms with a,103.68,5.52
very very nice pfs so,106.479,5.6
again highlighting how btk inhibitors do,109.2,4.8
really really well for patients who are,112.079,3.841
older maybe with comorbidities who are,114.0,4.64
treatment naive and if they have,115.92,4.64
high-risk features so the case i did was,118.64,4.56
a gentleman with a tp53 mutation you,120.56,4.879
know we tend to favor btk inhibitors,123.2,4.48
because we have the longest data and,125.439,4.721
really they've done so well the you know,127.68,5.6
the tp53 or the 17p deleted patients,130.16,5.439
really have done well with btk inhibitor,133.28,3.92
based therapy,135.599,4.401
um looking again at an older individual,137.2,4.8
i also discussed a little bit about,140.0,5.76
cll14 so venetoclax and obinutuzumab uh,142.0,5.92
versus openintuzumab and chlorambicell,145.76,4.0
and again highlighting how well patients,147.92,4.56
do with venetoclax and obentuzumab in,149.76,4.32
that setting,152.48,4.56
the pfs data not as robust for patients,154.08,6.56
with tp53 or deleted 17p so so you know,157.04,5.12
i kind of highlighted that many of us,160.64,3.92
still recommend a btk inhibitor based,162.16,4.88
therapy but really nice data so our,164.56,5.12
older patients who are treatment naive,167.04,5.279
really have you know can choose from btk,169.68,4.559
inhibitor based therapy versus,172.319,4.481
venetoclax so benetuzumab,174.239,4.64
um and obviously comorbidities will come,176.8,4.32
into play so depending upon what you,178.879,3.841
know what comorbidities your older,181.12,3.36
patient may have you might select you,182.72,3.12
know if they have cardiac issues you,184.48,3.28
might select venetoclax if they have,185.84,3.679
renal issues you might go with the btk,187.76,3.92
inhibitor but really highlighting more,189.519,4.881
robust long-term follow-up data from,191.68,4.479
some of these studies like resonate two,194.4,4.64
and elevate tn and the cll14 data so,196.159,4.961
that was the that was some of the cases,199.04,4.08
that i highlighted for treatment naive,201.12,4.8
older individual and then i also snuck,203.12,5.839
in a little case there that looked at um,205.92,4.48
a younger,208.959,2.801
it's probably irrelevant doesn't matter,210.4,3.119
about the age but a younger gentleman,211.76,4.72
who was already on a btk inhibitor,213.519,5.36
and doing well but then had evidence of,216.48,4.479
progressive disease after four years,218.879,4.481
being on therapy and so i think with,220.959,4.721
longer data since ibrutinib was first to,223.36,5.36
market and we've had that since 2013 you,225.68,4.88
know now we're starting to see btk,228.72,3.92
resistant mutations and so i highlighted,230.56,4.319
a little bit about resistant mutations,232.64,5.519
uh you know having a btkc 481 s mutation,234.879,6.08
plc gamma 2 mutations uh you know the,238.159,4.561
development of these resistant mutations,240.959,3.681
is starting to emerge,242.72,3.36
and we have,244.64,3.2
now some data about what to do about,246.08,3.84
those individuals so one the most,247.84,4.08
experience that we have is utilizing,249.92,4.48
venetoclax in this scenario,251.92,4.319
so we have data with venetoclax for,254.4,3.679
patients who have become resistant to a,256.239,3.921
btk and then of course we have some,258.079,4.4
newer agents we have the non-covalent,260.16,5.2
btk inhibitors such as pertibrutinib and,262.479,4.401
others coming down the pike that are,265.36,4.08
being evaluated with some some of that,266.88,4.72
data that was presented at ash and some,269.44,4.8
of the recent congresses at asco and eha,271.6,4.159
really suggesting that some of these,274.24,4.239
non-covalent btk inhibitors can salvage,275.759,4.88
patients who develop a btk resistant,278.479,4.801
mutation or even who have had venetoclax,280.639,4.721
and were resistant to venetoclax so,283.28,4.08
alternative options of therapy,285.36,4.48
highlighting for patients who again,287.36,4.88
might have developed a btk resistant,289.84,4.639
mutation so those are the those are the,292.24,6.92
cases and what i focused on,294.479,4.681
