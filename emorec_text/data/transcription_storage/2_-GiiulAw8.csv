hey in this quick video I want to talk,0.14,4.719
to you about something called the Dolan,2.939,4.201
phenomenon or the dawn effect this,4.859,4.891
happens to every human on the planet and,7.14,4.49
now that some of you are using,9.75,4.98
glucometers as a tool to test your,11.63,4.93
health and test your blood sugar you're,14.73,3.78
catching this and I'm gonna explain to,16.56,4.5
you what it is now first before I start,18.51,4.08
I want you to take one second and click,21.06,3.27
that subscribe button right down there,22.59,4.32
that says subscribe and that way every,24.33,4.17
time I get a bright idea you'll be one,26.91,3.539
of the very first to know about it now,28.5,4.59
let's talk about the dawn phenomenon or,30.449,5.971
the dawn effects so this I've heard a,33.09,6.809
couple of experts miss describe this in,36.42,4.709
the past few days and that's why I,39.899,3.18
wanted to make a video so you guys would,41.129,4.321
know exactly what's going on with the,43.079,4.05
dawn effect I'm gonna call it that,45.45,3.359
because that saves me some syllables in,47.129,4.95
the course of this video so everyone,48.809,6.39
when we're going from sleeping to waking,52.079,5.07
right when you're waking up in the,55.199,3.691
morning sometime between 2 a.m. and 8,57.149,5.371
a.m. for most of us your body has to do,58.89,5.43
things to actually wake you up and I,62.52,3.54
know the alarm clock wakes most of you,64.32,2.97
love but you're already in the process,66.06,3.3
of waking up before the alarm clock goes,67.29,5.54
off your body does this by increasing,69.36,7.049
secretions of cortisol epinephrine which,72.83,5.98
is adrenaline and nor epinephrine which,76.409,4.921
is noradrenaline depending on if you're,78.81,4.739
watching this from the US and Canada or,81.33,5.39
the UK so there's a there's a temporal,83.549,6.231
elevation of these three hormones and,86.72,5.74
that makes your blood sugar go up a few,89.78,5.08
points now I've heard experts say in the,92.46,4.11
last few days that this happens only in,94.86,3.899
diabetics which is absolutely not true,96.57,3.81
to my knowledge it happens in every,98.759,3.451
human on the face of the planet every,100.38,3.83
morning and then I've also heard people,102.21,4.619
imply that it only happens if you're,104.21,4.75
eating a ketogenic diet which is also,106.829,4.711
silly and untrue this happens to,108.96,4.86
everyone when they're waking up and some,111.54,4.41
of you may start a lake like Oh,113.82,4.439
something scared me that's the,115.95,4.169
adrenaline right in the cortisol and,118.259,4.201
when that happens your blood sugar goes,120.119,5.64
up anywhere from 5 to 25 points but it,122.46,4.769
doesn't stay up it's only up for a,125.759,3.39
little while and a lot of you have been,127.229,3.601
checking a fasting blood sugar and,129.149,3.991
that's how you've caught this this dawn,130.83,3.09
effect,133.14,2.64
right but then if you check again in an,133.92,3.48
hour your blood Sugar's right back down,135.78,3.72
to normal so there's no danger from this,137.4,3.78
if you're a diabetic and you have this,139.5,3.84
almost never should you adjust your,141.18,4.95
medications based on this so don't worry,143.34,4.74
about it just know about it and if,146.13,4.17
you're using a glucometer - and sticking,148.08,3.96
your finger watching your blood sugar,150.3,3.87
carefully making sure that you don't,152.04,4.98
have signs of hyperglycemia or insulin,154.17,5.73
resistance then you'll know that's the,157.02,4.85
dawn effect it's nothing to worry about,159.9,4.35
like I said your blood sugar can go up,161.87,4.66
anywhere from five to thirty points give,164.25,5.01
or take depending on the person and it's,166.53,4.56
not bad it's not dangerous there's,169.26,4.82
nothing you need to do the amount of,171.09,5.13
carbs that you've eaten the day before,174.08,4.42
really don't have much of an effect on,176.22,4.89
this at all and it's nothing to worry,178.5,4.739
about it's called the dawn effect or the,181.11,5.159
dawn phenomenon and you'll see this if,183.239,4.231
you're checking your blood sugar it's,186.269,2.97
absolutely nothing to worry about now if,187.47,3.21
you enjoyed this video and you know,189.239,3.03
someone who's just bought a glucometer,190.68,3.96
and they're checking their blood sugar,192.269,4.261
trying to get rid of their type-2,194.64,4.17
diabetes or trying not to become a,196.53,4.47
type-2 diabetic please share this video,198.81,3.69
with them on your social media please,201.0,4.14
email it to them please text it to them,202.5,4.98
that way when they check that morning,205.14,3.99
blood sugar and it's ten or twenty,207.48,3.27
points higher than they're expecting,209.13,4.56
they'll know it's the dawn phenomenon or,210.75,4.709
the dawn effect and it's not something,213.69,3.78
more concerning and more dangerous okay,215.459,3.78
