hey everyone died like Danica and I'm in,0.06,7.259
the bathroom and the reason I am is,3.419,6.691
because today's video is about showering,7.319,5.581
with the insulin pump I've gotten a,10.11,4.62
couple questions recently about what I,12.9,3.69
do when I shower with my pump and so I,14.73,3.95
thought I would answer that big video,16.59,5.58
now I have the Animus pump and this one,18.68,5.74
is waterproof actually but I still think,22.17,4.32
it all for showering because my big,24.42,7.679
thing is where would I put it no pockets,26.49,8.04
in the shower although I guess there are,32.099,4.171
those little like shell things but I,34.53,4.02
feel like they were just like I feel,36.27,4.23
like it would fall I would just swipe it,38.55,4.47
off and it would be bad so I don't wear,40.5,4.89
it in the shower if you don't know with,43.02,4.32
pumps you can literally just unclip them,45.39,3.87
whenever you want without taking out,47.34,3.78
actual sets so I just unclipped it right,49.26,4.92
now and my set is filling but it's,51.12,5.369
unclipped and so I do that before I go,54.18,6.39
in the shower but first I actually do,56.489,5.881
give a little bit of insulin before I go,60.57,3.57
in the shower so if I was going to take,62.37,2.609
a shower right now,64.14,2.67
I would go ahead and look at my basal,64.979,3.871
and if you can see its point seven-five,66.81,4.83
right now and I generally take about 20,68.85,5.04
minutes take a shower from the time I,71.64,3.869
take off my pumps but kind of get in the,73.89,3.479
shower come out dry out all that good,75.509,4.5
stuff and so I figure that's about half,77.369,6.151
of my basal rate to the hour and then is,80.009,4.921
round down because it's not quite a half,83.52,1.77
hour,84.93,3.479
so for 0.75 an hour I would probably,85.29,6.869
bolus about 0.3 or 0.35 and then I would,88.409,5.611
go ahead after Bowl listen I would,92.159,4.081
unclip it and what I like to do is I,94.02,4.55
just wrap the tubing around the pump and,96.24,6.33
kind of tuck this in here just put all,98.57,6.28
nice and cozy you can suspend your pump,102.57,4.11
actually so that no in finish push,104.85,3.629
through but it's such a short amount of,106.68,3.96
time that I'm just like forget it I,108.479,4.441
don't want to vibrating in my room for,110.64,3.479
the whole time in the shower that would,112.92,2.61
be really annoying especially in the,114.119,3.331
morning my roommates are sleeping so I'm,115.53,4.35
just like you know what just leave it on,117.45,4.11
and then when I come back out of the,119.88,3.54
shower I try to reconnect as soon as,121.56,3.75
possible sometimes I forget and I end up,123.42,4.26
like doing my hair my makeup and I like,125.31,4.589
don't have it plugged in and I'm like,127.68,3.46
shoot,129.899,4.621
but try to put it in as fast as possible,131.14,5.31
speaking out of I should put this back,134.52,5.02
right now actually used to not bullets,136.45,4.65
at all when I took a shower because it,139.54,4.08
was just so short but I feel like it's a,141.1,3.9
good thing to do because I have noticed,143.62,3.78
sometimes I do go high after showering,145.0,4.23
but it's my blood Sugar's on the lower,147.4,3.87
side before I shower then sometimes I'll,149.23,4.23
just skip it to the mic well I don't,151.27,3.42
really want a bolus hop in the shower,153.46,3.48
and then go low so if I'm on the lower,154.69,4.71
side after gets a bolus there actually,156.94,4.26
are these little shower places the sets,159.4,4.14
come with if you can see that but I,161.2,3.6
actually don't use these for showering,163.54,3.99
just because showers are very clean,164.8,4.65
nothing really gets in there if I do go,167.53,4.709
swimming in a lake or the ocean I do use,169.45,5.16
these but yeah that's what those are so,172.239,4.891
that is all I do to shower with an,174.61,4.23
