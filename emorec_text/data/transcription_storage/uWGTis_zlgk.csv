now as you know the retina is the light,7.62,6.04
sensitive area at the back of the eye,11.02,6.12
contains rods and cones the,13.66,6.39
light-sensitive cells and these convert,17.14,5.25
the light impulse into an electrical,20.05,5.129
impulse which goes to the optic nerve,22.39,5.0
and onto the occipital lobe of the brain,25.179,5.58
where it's interpreting this vision so,27.39,4.539
here we have the retina at the back of,30.759,5.911
the eye and as we know in diabetes part,31.929,7.77
of the problem is that the capillaries,36.67,8.729
get thicker basement membrane so there's,39.699,7.311
a thickening of the basement membrane,45.399,5.581
and as well as being thicker as we've,47.01,6.009
said the basement membrane is more,50.98,7.109
permeable so plasma fluid can leak out,53.019,9.09
into the retina so the capillaries in,58.089,6.571
the retina can become leaky and we can,62.109,6.751
get exudate accumulating in areas of the,64.66,6.779
retina and this can damage the very,68.86,6.149
delicate light-sensitive cells as a,71.439,6.811
result of the aging age but as the,75.009,7.711
basement membranes become thicker the,78.25,7.14
thick basement membrane kind of starts,82.72,6.899
to close off the capillaries and as well,85.39,7.11
as that it loses the pulsatile ability,89.619,5.341
which evens out the blood flowing,92.5,5.549
through to the tissue so what this means,94.96,5.04
is you can start to get ischemic changes,98.049,5.1
in the areas of the rest of this,100.0,5.159
microscopic blood vessel would normally,103.149,5.79
supply and as well as that you get,105.159,7.111
trouble iteration of the endothelial,108.939,8.671
cells inside the capillaries so you get,112.27,6.57
thickening of the basement membrane,117.61,5.009
pushing in you lose the ability to,118.84,6.48
smooth out the blood flow and also the,122.619,5.401
lumen of the pillory gets clogged up by,125.32,6.66
a proliferation of vascular endothelial,128.02,6.99
cells and this means that an area of the,131.98,3.43
retina,135.01,3.87
now is going to be ischemic and,135.41,7.26
therefore hypoxia not hypoxic so that's,138.88,5.68
bad that's bad for the retina as well so,142.67,3.51
we're areas of every day and now we've,144.56,5.61
got an area of hypoxic ischemia so,146.18,9.57
that's bad but the hypoxia stimulates,150.17,7.8
the development of new blood vessels as,155.75,5.52
well so the hypoxia because there's in a,157.97,5.85
hypoxic area that stimulates new blood,161.27,8.43
vessels to grow into the retina and you,163.82,7.14
might think that that's good,169.7,3.09
in fact descent in a sense it is good,170.96,4.08
because blood can go in the new blood,172.79,5.16
vessels to this area of the retina and,175.04,6.3
carry oxygen and correct the hypoxia so,177.95,5.31
that sounds good that the retinas kind,181.34,5.28
of healed itself but the problem is,183.26,5.52
these new blood vessels develop quickly,186.62,5.67
and die of low quality the walls of,188.78,5.21
these new blood vessels are quite,192.29,5.7
friable and they burst so you can get,193.99,7.45
bursting of these walls leading to areas,197.99,6.27
of blood leaking out into the retina and,201.44,6.51
of course this gives us a retinal,204.26,8.67
hemorrhage then we get retinal,207.95,7.62
hemorrhage and the presence of the blood,212.93,5.279
lying over the retina will kill the,215.57,6.92
retinal cells in that area so we've got,218.209,7.021
exudates accumulating accumulating in,222.49,5.77
the retina we've got hypoxia we've got,225.23,4.62
new blood vessels which are bursting,228.26,3.9
causing retinal hemorrhages so there's,229.85,4.58
quite a few insults to the retina here,232.16,4.73
so what are we going to do about this,234.43,4.93
well again we need to keep the blood,236.89,5.2
sugar down near physiological levels,239.36,5.19
many trials have shown this that if you,242.09,5.27
can keep the blood sugar levels down the,244.55,6.0
prognosis in terms of eyesight and renal,247.36,6.73
function is improved so good glycemic,250.55,6.78
control absolutely vital good blood,254.09,5.73
pressure control also important for the,257.33,6.089
retina just as it's important for the,259.82,6.96
kidneys so we've looked at the micro,263.419,4.961
vascular disease call,266.78,4.48
in diabetic nephropathy affecting the,268.38,6.12
kidneys retinopathy affecting the eyes,271.26,5.78
and the next one we want to look at is,274.5,5.51
neuropathy as it can affect the nervous,277.04,7.65
system affecting the neurons,280.01,4.68
