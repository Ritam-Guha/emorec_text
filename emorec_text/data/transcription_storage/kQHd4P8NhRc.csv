diabetic retinopathy is a small vessel,4.45,4.66
ischemic disease when the blood triggers,6.859,3.811
are elevated it can affect the blood,9.11,3.21
vessels anywhere in your body it can,10.67,3.509
affect your heart your kidneys the nerve,12.32,3.779
endings for the fingers and toes but it,14.179,3.241
also affects the back of your eyes,16.099,3.27
called the retina where it primarily,17.42,4.38
affects the arteries and the veins what,19.369,4.41
it does is that it causes a lack of,21.8,4.74
blood circulation when the retina is,23.779,4.741
robbed of its blood supply it gets,26.54,4.469
distressed we found out one of the,28.52,4.89
factors that is released in a distressed,31.009,4.861
retina is called vascular endothelial,33.41,5.94
growth factor also known as veg F when,35.87,6.33
reg F is upregulated in a distressed eye,39.35,5.1
it causes the existing blood vessels to,42.2,4.95
leak blood and fluid and when a leaks,44.45,3.75
blood and fluid in the strenght of the,47.15,2.61
red and then we call that macular edema,48.2,4.35
and that can lead to blurred vision it,49.76,4.47
can also lead to a lack of blood,52.55,3.75
circulation that can affect the,54.23,3.96
peripheral retina and can make those,56.3,4.29
existing blood vessels grow and when,58.19,3.95
these blood vessels grow we call that,60.59,4.109
neovascularization which means new blood,62.14,5.17
vessels now these new blood vessels are,64.699,5.551
very friable they can actually lead into,67.31,4.41
the middle of your eye and patients can,70.25,3.69
develop a shadow in their vision and we,71.72,3.509
just known as a vitreous hemorrhage,73.94,4.14
now these blood vessels also grow with a,75.229,5.581
scaffolding of scar tissue and when this,78.08,5.13
scar tissue grows into the vitreous it,80.81,4.68
can contract and that can lead to the,83.21,5.07
retina to be detached you call that,85.49,4.559
attraction retinal attachment there are,88.28,3.84
several forms of diabetic retinopathy,90.049,3.93
there's the non-proliferation form and,92.12,4.41
the proliferative form patients who,93.979,4.921
start off with diabetic retinopathy may,96.53,4.65
start with the mild form where we see,98.9,4.38
microaneurysms and those are the out,101.18,3.54
poaching's of the blood vessels,103.28,3.78
sometimes these micro aneurysms can leak,104.72,3.54
blood flew and that can cause some,107.06,4.02
vision change now as diabetic,108.26,5.49
retinopathy progresses it can lead to,111.08,4.649
what's called moderate non-political,113.75,4.68
diabetic retinopathy we often see more,115.729,4.291
retinal hemorrhages in the periphery,118.43,3.81
sometimes we see cotton-wool spots and,120.02,3.09
hard exudates,122.24,3.78
and as it gets even worse we may see,123.11,5.159
severe non-political diabetic,126.02,4.65
retinopathy the severe non-preferred,128.269,5.55
diabetic retinopathy we see hemorrhages,130.67,6.06
in all four quadrants of the retina the,133.819,3.601
blood,136.73,3.27
those can have some distortions we call,137.42,4.59
that Venus beating as well as the,140.0,4.38
development of inter retina micro,142.01,6.39
vascular abnormalities these we call,144.38,7.02
them Irma Irma can be the precursors of,148.4,5.22
neovascularization and we see severe,151.4,4.5
non-political diabetic nathi we get more,153.62,5.04
concerned now the progression of,155.9,7.49
diabetic neuropathy can get worse and,158.66,7.74
when you have the mild form we estimated,163.39,5.59
about a 6% chance of developing into the,166.4,5.7
proliferative form within 12 months with,168.98,5.58
moderate it's about 20 to 40 percent and,172.1,5.52
with severe it can progress to,174.56,5.04
proliferative diabetic neuropathy up to,177.62,6.36
60% of the time within 12 months so when,179.6,5.49
it gets to proliferative diabetic,183.98,3.509
retinopathy that's when we see the,185.09,5.7
beginnings of neovascularization when,187.489,5.491
the NIA valorisation occurs it can occur,190.79,4.979
from the optic nerve the retinal vessels,192.98,6.03
in the peripheral retina as well as the,195.769,5.491
anterior parts of the eye like the iris,199.01,5.16
and the angle those can bleed into the,201.26,4.17
middle of your eye cause vitreous,204.17,3.45
hemorrhage and traction detachments the,205.43,5.01
complications when diabetes gets to its,207.62,4.649
advanced stage or what we call,210.44,4.5
proliferative diabetic retinopathy occur,212.269,5.371
with neovascularization when the,214.94,4.71
neovascularization occurs it can stem,217.64,3.659
from the optic nerve the retinal vessels,219.65,6.839
or the periphery and what can happen is,221.299,7.5
these blood vessels can bleed into the,226.489,3.75
middle of your eye and patients will,228.799,3.75
develop a vitreous hemorrhage and show,230.239,4.981
vision loss sometimes these blood,232.549,5.131
vessels will grow scar tissue and as the,235.22,4.62
scar tissue contracts it can lift the,237.68,4.35
retina off and that leads to something,239.84,3.959
called a traction retinal detachment,242.03,4.739
patients can go blind from that in the,243.799,5.131
front of the eye neovascularization can,246.769,4.771
affect the iris and the angle if it,248.93,5.279
affects the angle it can lead to,251.54,4.65
pressure increases as these blood,254.209,3.87
vessels block the plumbing system of the,256.19,3.98
outflow of the eye all the,258.079,4.161
conditions can lead to severe vision,260.17,4.68
loss and blindness within the next few,262.24,5.66
years if untreated,264.85,3.05
