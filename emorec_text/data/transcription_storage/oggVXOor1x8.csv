hey guys back with a new educational,0.03,5.039
video and this week our content is,2.52,4.56
coming from dr. Mark Hyman,5.069,4.981
one of my favorite people on the,7.08,5.88
interwebs actually he's not if you,10.05,3.509
couldn't tell,12.96,4.98
so Hyman likes to really stir the pot,13.559,6.001
and say things that are pretty,17.94,5.7
outlandish but that the average person,19.56,7.62
buys into it's really kind of disturbing,23.64,6.32
but he put up a post the other day that,27.18,5.75
really made me laugh and the post was,29.96,5.05
artificial sweetners trick your,32.93,4.21
metabolism into thinking sugar is on its,35.01,4.619
way this causes your body to pump out,37.14,4.5
insulin the fat storage hormone which,39.629,4.95
lays down more belly fat let's unpack,41.64,5.43
that a little bit so first of all,44.579,5.311
there's actually no research that I'm,47.07,3.509
aware of,49.89,2.46
showing that artificial sweeteners,50.579,4.351
increase insulin there's been several,52.35,4.709
studies looking at it none has shown,54.93,6.66
this further if insulin was released in,57.059,7.201
significant amounts from consuming,61.59,4.92
artificial sweeteners then every time,64.26,4.2
you drank a diet coke you would go,66.51,5.31
hypoglycemic why because insulin,68.46,5.699
responds to increases in blood glucose,71.82,5.939
and insulin acts to drive glucose into,74.159,7.14
cells and lower blood glucose so if your,77.759,5.911
blood glucose does not elevate which,81.299,5.841
would not happen from a diet coke then,83.67,6.629
you're gonna go hypoglycemic because if,87.14,4.659
insulin is released it's gonna drive,90.299,3.36
down your blood sugar that doesn't,91.799,5.311
happen so the only other option is if,93.659,6.301
insulin went up that glucagon is also,97.11,4.829
going up in concert glucagon acts in,99.96,4.32
opposition to insulin but the great,101.939,4.11
thing about glucagon is you don't have,104.28,3.06
to worry about fat storage because,106.049,4.201
glucagon increases lipolysis so anything,107.34,4.65
that would be happy with insulin would,110.25,4.89
be offset by glue gun but the research,111.99,5.159
seems to show that artificial sweeteners,115.14,4.29
don't really increase insulin and if we,117.149,5.82
look at the long-term data straight up,119.43,6.21
there was a study where they compared,122.969,4.801
people who drank artificial sweeteners,125.64,6.29
versus water okay so they had one,127.77,5.93
just drink water they had another group,131.93,4.38
that drank sugar or artificially,133.7,4.89
sweetened beverages they actually found,136.31,3.81
that the group that drank artificially,138.59,3.119
sweetened beverages lost a little bit,140.12,3.839
more body weight and body fat I'm not,141.709,3.961
saying that these things are fat burners,143.959,4.021
they are not that group probably,145.67,5.25
consumed less calories for me and others,147.98,6.149
I know that having a diet coke can be a,150.92,5.01
little satiating or something for that,154.129,3.69
nature the carbonation you get that,155.93,3.21
little bit of sweetness it can kind of,157.819,2.79
hold off some of those sugar cravings,159.14,3.9
that doesn't work for everybody some,160.609,5.22
people don't like being exposed to,163.04,4.559
sweetness any kind of sweetness because,165.829,3.211
it causes them to have an urge to,167.599,4.381
overeat on sweetness hey that's great if,169.04,4.619
you know you're one of those people then,171.98,4.17
avoid but if you're people like me and,173.659,5.73
Holly who really get a lot out of just,176.15,4.169
being able to have something a little,179.389,4.71
bit sweet then it's fine and there's no,180.319,5.401
evidence increases insulin it's not,184.099,2.911
going to cause you to lay down body fat,185.72,5.04
and if it did why when it's compared,187.01,5.839
straight up with water do we not see a,190.76,4.909
drastically different loss of body fat,192.849,5.441
we don't see that in fact we see just a,195.669,4.451
little bit more loss in the group,198.29,4.229
drinking artificial sweeteners so I'm,200.12,3.269
