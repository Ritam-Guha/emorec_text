[Music],1.03,9.85
the common current understanding about,9.04,3.28
peripheral neuropathy is that it's a,10.88,2.4
progressive and,12.32,4.719
incurable disease process so all of the,13.28,5.999
treatments designed around peripheral,17.039,3.761
neuropathy is sort of,19.279,4.08
to try and manage it you know medicines,20.8,3.68
like lyrica,23.359,4.561
or gabapentin or narcotic pain,24.48,4.719
medication,27.92,3.759
and then there's a whole slew of other,29.199,4.081
treatments that really sort of,31.679,5.201
cross over into the snake oil you know,33.28,7.119
department none of that even claims to,36.88,4.96
cure neuropathy it's sort of,40.399,5.441
all just to try and manage the symptoms,41.84,4.0
[Music],47.01,5.15
one of the most important advances in,49.2,5.679
the treatment of peripheral neuropathy,52.16,4.879
is the concept of what is actually,54.879,3.52
causing the pain,57.039,3.601
in many patients with peripheral,58.399,3.361
neuropathy,60.64,2.719
the actual clinical symptoms the,61.76,3.52
numbness the burning the tingling the,63.359,3.041
weakness etc,65.28,3.76
is secondary to mechanical compression,66.4,3.84
that has developed,69.04,3.04
so these nerves are being squeezed or,70.24,3.76
pinched there's a metabolic,72.08,5.12
process in diabetics for example or,74.0,4.96
somebody with hypothyroidism,77.2,3.2
although very often you can't really,78.96,3.36
identify whatever the underlying process,80.4,2.88
is,82.32,5.04
but that's not as important as the um,83.28,5.68
what it does to the nerves which is it,87.36,3.439
causes these nerves to swell,88.96,4.32
and so these nerves become pinched they,90.799,4.561
run in tight spaces especially around,93.28,4.64
joints and and places like that and so,95.36,3.2
if you have a,97.92,2.64
defined space and all of a sudden the,98.56,3.919
nerve starts to swell and become larger,100.56,4.08
pretty soon the tissue around the nerve,102.479,3.521
starts acting as a mechanical,104.64,3.439
compression point on the nerve,106.0,4.56
and this is what is actually causing,108.079,3.841
much of the clinical symptoms in,110.56,5.28
patients with peripheral neuropathy,111.92,3.92
[Music],116.18,8.589
if you can identify which nerves and,125.759,4.64
exactly at what locations,128.319,4.161
the pressure on the nerves is being,130.399,4.081
applied you can go in surgically and,132.48,4.08
decompress the nerves the concept is the,134.48,2.64
same as,136.56,2.319
you would do for somebody who has carpal,137.12,6.72
tunnel syndrome,138.879,4.961
it's well accepted to decompress nerves,146.64,4.08
in the upper extremity for somebody with,148.879,3.761
diabetes who has the same symptoms in,150.72,3.92
their hands and arms as they do in their,152.64,3.599
lower legs and feet but nobody ever,154.64,3.12
thinks about doing surgery for the,156.239,3.121
nerves down the lower legs,157.76,3.28
and it's the same process that's going,159.36,4.56
on so that's really an important,161.04,5.279
point to understand in regards with,163.92,4.92
treatment of peripheral neuropathy,166.319,5.521
nowadays,168.84,3.0
