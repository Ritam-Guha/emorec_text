hi and welcome or welcome back to this,0.32,2.96
friday's,2.56,2.48
five-minute consult with your favorite,3.28,4.4
family med doc,5.04,4.559
in these videos i discuss everything,7.68,3.68
that you need to know about some of the,9.599,3.681
most common health conditions in,11.36,4.479
five minutes or less these common health,13.28,5.36
conditions include topics listed a to z,15.839,5.121
and today's topic begins with the letter,18.64,3.2
c so,20.96,5.12
let's talk about cellulitis what is it,21.84,6.24
no it's not that unsightly condition,26.08,3.92
that women get on the back of their legs,28.08,6.4
called cellulite it's cellulitis which,30.0,5.2
is actually,34.48,2.96
an infection of the skin and soft,35.2,3.76
tissues underneath,37.44,4.72
what causes it cellulitis can occur,38.96,5.119
anytime there is bacteria,42.16,4.559
introduced underneath the skin it can be,44.079,3.041
from,46.719,3.52
any break in the skin such as a scratch,47.12,5.84
a cut or even a bug bite while working,50.239,4.401
in urgent care i saw a,52.96,4.56
ton of patients who had somehow gotten a,54.64,3.36
spider,57.52,3.44
bite and this led to a lot of redness,58.0,3.92
and swelling,60.96,2.88
while they are more concerned about the,61.92,4.0
spider bite the more important thing to,63.84,3.599
treat is the actual skin,65.92,3.6
infection that the spider bite led to,67.439,4.161
which is cellulitis,69.52,4.8
so what are the symptoms when you have,71.6,4.8
cellulitis whether it be due to a,74.32,3.92
scratch or a bug bite,76.4,4.56
you will experiencing a lot of redness,78.24,4.239
that is expanding,80.96,3.6
you may even see some swelling,82.479,4.561
experience some pain around the area or,84.56,5.12
notice some warmth on the skin you may,87.04,5.439
be more at risk to develop cellulitis,89.68,5.6
if you have trauma to the skin if you,92.479,4.241
are a diabetic,95.28,3.92
if you have circulatory problems such as,96.72,4.48
not enough blood flow to your arms or,99.2,4.08
your legs which can be evidenced by,101.2,3.279
varicose veins,103.28,3.04
if you have any type of liver disease,104.479,4.481
such as hepatitis or cirrhosis,106.32,4.64
or if you have other skin disorders such,108.96,4.08
as eczema or psoriasis,110.96,4.08
cellulitis may also occur as an,113.04,3.92
infection after surgery where you may,115.04,2.48
notice,116.96,2.56
redness warmth or swelling around the,117.52,3.04
surgical site,119.52,3.04
some other symptoms of cellulitis that,120.56,4.08
we didn't talk about yet may include,122.56,4.64
streaks of redness let's say you had a,124.64,4.56
cut on your arm you're noticing redness,127.2,4.0
and swelling there but then you're also,129.2,4.16
seeing a streak of redness going all the,131.2,3.44
way up your arm,133.36,3.76
also any type of yellow or clear fluid,134.64,3.2
along with,137.12,4.0
pus in a cut or abrasion can represent,137.84,4.96
an infection of the skin,141.12,2.96
if you are noticing any of these,142.8,3.12
symptoms or signs on your skin,144.08,3.84
you do need to see a doctor because if,145.92,4.319
cellulitis goes untreated it can get,147.92,3.599
worse and it can become,150.239,3.921
severe if left untreated you could start,151.519,3.281
to develop,154.16,3.2
high fevers or chills nausea and,154.8,3.28
vomiting,157.36,3.36
enlarging or hardening of the red area,158.08,4.72
as well as increased pain or numbness,160.72,3.44
when you touch the area,162.8,3.12
more importantly cellulitis should be,164.16,3.84
treated right away because if not it can,165.92,3.92
actually leak into the bloodstream,168.0,4.08
causing a serious blood infection,169.84,4.0
which can become severe leading to,172.08,4.32
something called sepsis or even death,173.84,5.44
so what is the treatment because,176.4,4.559
cellulitis is caused by,179.28,4.56
bacteria infecting the skin it does need,180.959,5.2
to be treated with antibiotics,183.84,4.319
this time topical antibiotics or,186.159,4.321
something like neosporin is not going to,188.159,4.401
cut it you do need to be on an oral,190.48,3.6
antibiotic that your doctor will,192.56,2.72
prescribe for you,194.08,3.6
if you are also experiencing some pain,195.28,3.92
around the area you can take,197.68,4.24
tylenol or ibuprofen and sometimes,199.2,5.119
applying a cool pack or ice pack can,201.92,3.28
also help,204.319,3.361
in some cases of cellulitis it can be a,205.2,4.88
severe infection caused by a bacteria,207.68,3.16
known as,210.08,4.32
mrsa or methicillin resistant staph,210.84,5.64
aureus in this case your doctor will,214.4,4.08
need to put you on two antibiotics to,216.48,3.36
help clear the infection,218.48,4.319
typically clindamycin and bactrim if,219.84,4.8
your cellulitis isn't improving or,222.799,3.201
resolving after being on,224.64,3.2
two antibiotics in the outpatient,226.0,3.76
setting then your doctor may suggest,227.84,3.28
that you need to be admitted to the,229.76,2.559
hospital to receive,231.12,3.759
iv antibiotics to clear the infection,232.319,4.801
also in some cases although it's rare,234.879,3.36
cellulitis can,237.12,3.679
form an abscess which is an accumulation,238.239,3.121
of pus,240.799,2.72
underneath the skin if that happens your,241.36,4.0
doctor will need to perform a small,243.519,3.92
outpatient procedure which is going to,245.36,4.0
be putting a small cut in the skin to,247.439,3.121
drain the pus,249.36,3.92
now let's talk about prevention some,250.56,3.44
ways to prevent,253.28,2.48
cellulitis from occurring would be to,254.0,3.44
keep good personal hygiene,255.76,3.92
and to keep your skin clean you want to,257.44,4.24
protect your skin from any scrapes or,259.68,4.079
cuts but if you do get a cut you want to,261.68,4.239
wash that area with soap and water,263.759,3.681
gently so that it can prevent any,265.919,3.201
bacteria from getting in,267.44,3.759
when some people get a cut on their skin,269.12,4.56
their initial reaction is to pour a ton,271.199,5.521
of hydrogen peroxide on the wound they,273.68,5.2
then proceed to continue to clean their,276.72,4.64
wound daily with hydrogen peroxide,278.88,4.16
i would like to inform you that this is,281.36,3.6
not the best wound care method as,283.04,4.0
hydrogen peroxide can actually be,284.96,4.239
harsh on the skin and cause further,287.04,3.76
breakdown of the skin,289.199,3.361
just a gentle cleansing with regular,290.8,3.52
soap and water is all you need to help,292.56,2.56
clean the skin,294.32,2.96
as the wound heals over-the-counter,295.12,4.48
triple antibiotic ointment or something,297.28,3.759
known as neosporin,299.6,4.319
is also heavily used by people but,301.039,4.801
applying a lot of this can actually,303.919,3.921
introduce bacteria into the skin,305.84,4.079
especially if you're not washing your,307.84,3.919
hands prior to putting it on,309.919,3.921
so when it comes to neosporin i always,311.759,3.041
tell my patients,313.84,3.12
less is best and always make sure your,314.8,3.52
hands are clean,316.96,3.28
especially before you apply it to your,318.32,3.84
skin and that wraps up our discussion,320.24,4.239
today on cellulitis i hope that you,322.16,3.599
learned something new,324.479,3.201
