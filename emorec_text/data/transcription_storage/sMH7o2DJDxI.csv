um,3.28,3.039
i've had i i can tell you've had,3.919,4.241
multiple patients,6.319,4.641
who had changes in their jaw their bite,8.16,5.599
uh even the spacing between their teeth,10.96,5.76
uh temporal mandibular joint problems,13.759,3.841
that had been,16.72,3.68
seeing um you know specialists in,17.6,4.96
dentistry in order to fix those problems,20.4,4.24
for example thinking that maybe their,22.56,4.799
growth hormone headaches were actually,24.64,4.24
coming because of jaw pain,27.359,4.401
and temporomandibular joint problems i,28.88,4.56
at one point had a patient,31.76,4.959
whose uh dentist had proposed pulling,33.44,5.36
all of his teeth out,36.719,4.561
for false teeth to alleviate his,38.8,3.279
symptoms,41.28,3.599
and about two weeks after that proposed,42.079,3.681
uh,44.879,3.281
procedure which the patient had come to,45.76,3.119
the um,48.16,3.84
pituitary center for an analysis or an,48.879,4.081
assessment,52.0,2.64
and he was diagnosed with with the,52.96,3.599
growth hormone tumor which was removed,54.64,4.0
and when it was removed those symptoms,56.559,2.8
were,58.64,3.759
alleviated so you know adults,59.359,5.44
we our teeth shouldn't change that much,62.399,4.641
our jaw our shape of our face,64.799,4.561
the jaw changes shouldn't happen as an,67.04,3.52
adult so when,69.36,3.6
those are happening you know the dentist,70.56,4.32
really provides that continuity people,72.96,4.479
do go in every six months or every year,74.88,4.8
they're getting you know x-rays of their,77.439,4.32
of their bone structure and their teeth,79.68,3.68
and i think,81.759,4.241
we should figure out a way as you point,83.36,4.799
out to educate,86.0,4.64
our colleagues in dentistry about they,88.159,3.761
could be the first line,90.64,3.76
seeing these changes um in the jaw and,91.92,3.839
the teeth,94.4,3.2
we did have a meeting a few years ago,95.759,3.921
and discussed how we could do,97.6,3.839
outreach to the american dental,99.68,4.079
association do you do that at an annual,101.439,3.36
meeting,103.759,3.04
do you put together a pamphlet that you,104.799,3.201
send out to,106.799,3.841
dentists that they you know as a as an,108.0,5.6
educational tool in their office,110.64,4.88
but i think you make a really valid,113.6,3.36
point that,115.52,3.76
we as endocrinologists talk all the time,116.96,3.519
about,119.28,4.32
how how could this be missed and yet,120.479,4.081
have we done,123.6,2.799
a good enough job in educating our,124.56,4.479
colleagues because it is rare but,126.399,9.281
we see it more frequently than they do,129.039,6.641
