hi i'm dr. russ and a member of harris,3.11,5.98
teeters your wellness team today I'm,6.45,4.47
going to discuss the terms glycemic,9.09,4.44
index and glycemic load and why,10.92,4.98
understanding these terms may help you,13.53,4.98
lead a healthier life you may have heard,15.9,4.53
the terms by Simic index or glycemic,18.51,3.81
load being mentioned when your doctor's,20.43,4.17
discuss nutrition and health they're,22.32,5.01
helpful dietary concepts once we get,24.6,5.429
down to basics the glycemic index is,27.33,4.949
used to classify foods based on how,30.029,4.021
quickly they cause a rise in blood sugar,32.279,5.19
upon being eaten when high glycemic,34.05,5.759
index foods are eaten there's a rapid,37.469,4.081
rise in blood sugar followed by a,39.809,4.381
significant release of insulin causing,41.55,4.95
blood sugar levels to fall creating,44.19,5.88
fatigue and hunger consistently eating,46.5,5.82
high glycemic index foods may lessen,50.07,4.5
your body's sensitivity to insulin over,52.32,4.98
time leading to type-2 diabetes and,54.57,5.94
other illnesses sugar and white bread,57.3,5.309
are considered reference foods and have,60.51,4.039
been assigned to glycemic index of 100,62.609,4.531
because they both caused a rapid rise in,64.549,5.741
blood sugar levels after ingestion all,67.14,4.799
other foods are assigned a,70.29,5.07
proportionately lower value from 1 to 99,71.939,5.881
based on how they affect blood sugar,75.36,5.939
compared to sugar or white bread low,77.82,5.52
glycemic index foods are digested more,81.299,4.741
slowly resulting in a gentle rise in,83.34,4.77
blood sugar followed by a more moderate,86.04,4.35
release of insulin thereby helping to,88.11,4.649
maintain consistent blood glucose levels,90.39,4.85
and lessening fatigue and,92.759,5.4
by Seema Clos takes the concept of,95.24,6.01
glycemic index a step further offering a,98.159,4.921
more accurate reflection of the impact,101.25,4.35
eating a specific food has on your blood,103.08,5.25
sugar and insulin levels the glycemic,105.6,4.08
load takes into account the relative,108.33,3.84
amount of carbohydrate the food contains,109.68,5.84
in an average serving as an example,112.17,6.449
watermelon has a glycemic index of 72,115.52,5.739
which is pretty high but it's mostly,118.619,5.101
made up of water and contains relatively,121.259,4.981
little carbohydrate so it's glycemic,123.72,6.33
load is only between 4 and 7 now your,126.24,5.7
blood sugar may go up rapidly after,130.05,4.11
eating watermelon but it shouldn't go up,131.94,3.84
very much since there's not much,134.16,3.81
carbohydrate present and watermelon to,135.78,4.11
be converted into sugar in the first,137.97,5.22
place on the other hand half a bagel has,139.89,5.34
a glycemic index similar to watermelon,143.19,5.549
at 72 but a much higher glycemic load of,145.23,7.53
almost 26 thus a bigger sugar load for,148.739,4.56
your body,152.76,2.97
there are many reference lists that,153.299,3.931
detail the glycemic index and glycemic,155.73,4.53
load of your favorite foods and both by,157.23,5.069
scenic index and glycemic load are,160.26,4.319
helpful guides when choosing healthy,162.299,4.591
carbohydrates but you can't determine,164.579,4.141
whether or not a food is healthy for you,166.89,4.65
based solely on these numbers they're,168.72,5.22
useful concepts but the quality and,171.54,4.53
concentration of nutrients found within,173.94,4.41
a given food have to be factored in as,176.07,4.83
well I hope this helps clear up any,178.35,4.5
confusion around by Simac index and,180.9,6.27
