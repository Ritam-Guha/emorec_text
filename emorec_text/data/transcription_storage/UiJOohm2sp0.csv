hey guys in this video we're going to,0.03,3.54
talk about the side effects of metformin,1.17,4.95
okay this is a diabetic medication,3.57,4.83
that's used for insulin resistance so,6.12,4.53
basically it just makes the receptor,8.4,5.01
cells absorb insulin better and it,10.65,5.879
blocks the liver from making sugar it,13.41,5.369
was originally developed from the lilac,16.529,4.08
flower which is another name for that is,18.779,4.5
called go true there is a active,20.609,7.221
ingredient called guanidine that helps,23.279,7.051
insulin resistance but the problem is,27.83,5.47
that it creates lactic acidosis which is,30.33,5.61
a bigger side effect it's a toxic side,33.3,4.41
effect which you would get fatigue,35.94,4.35
weakness muscle pain difficulty,37.71,6.029
breathing vomiting and you know a 50% of,40.29,5.609
the time you die okay so that's a,43.739,4.291
problem however when you're consuming,45.899,4.111
metformin you're not consuming straight,48.03,4.32
guanidine it's a slight different,50.01,3.99
variation of it I don't know exactly the,52.35,4.2
details but it's not the same thing okay,54.0,4.35
so what are the side effects of,56.55,5.75
metformin diarrhea headaches heartburn,58.35,9.72
stomach cramps and lactic acidosis okay,62.3,8.859
I mean metformin has a black box warning,68.07,6.75
that's a very severe warning now this,71.159,5.611
may be rare but if you get this,74.82,4.38
condition it's not good,76.77,5.459
so if someone is on this medication I,79.2,5.73
always always recommend also taking,82.229,5.82
vitamin b1 from nutritional yeast,84.93,7.32
because severe lactic acidosis can be,88.049,8.661
reversed by taking b1 within 24 hours,92.25,7.92
b1 protects against lactic acidosis now,96.71,6.189
here's the problem and that Foreman,100.17,5.97
blocks your absorption of b1 and if,102.899,4.771
you're a diabetic already taking,106.14,3.33
metformin you're already going to be,107.67,4.44
deficient to b1 in the first place so,109.47,5.28
you that's why you need to take b1 to,112.11,4.619
minimize the side effects specifically,114.75,4.799
this one and do healthy ketosis in a,116.729,4.89
minute fasting to ultimately correct the,119.549,4.381
deeper cause of the reason why you're on,121.619,3.901
this in the first place but as your,123.93,3.45
transition of healing your body and,125.52,4.709
coming off this definitely take vitamin,127.38,4.89
b1 in the form of nutritional yeast,130.229,4.951
alright thanks for watching if you're,132.27,4.32
enjoying this information and getting,135.18,2.22
something out of it,136.59,3.42
please give me an unbiased Google review,137.4,6.77
I put a link down below thanks,140.01,4.16
