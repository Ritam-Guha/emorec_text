hey guys in this video I want to bring,0.03,4.71
up a question what is worse having high,1.829,6.541
insulin or having high glucose type down,4.74,7.109
below what you think is worse okay let's,8.37,5.729
just talk about it so the first thing to,11.849,5.701
occur in the chain of events is high,14.099,5.731
insulin okay then a person develops,17.55,5.51
insulin resistance which is pre-diabetes,19.83,5.959
then eventually they'll develop,23.06,6.0
hyperglycemia which is high sugar hyper,25.789,5.951
glycaemia is high amounts of sugar which,29.06,6.7
is now diagnosed as diabetes but in this,31.74,6.06
process right here if their adrenals are,35.76,5.15
weak okay they can actually develop,37.8,5.61
hypoglycemia because the high amounts of,40.91,4.48
insulin is driving down the sugar and,43.41,5.43
the body doesn't have the kind of the,45.39,5.759
buffering the neutralization of the low,48.84,4.05
blood sugar like the adrenals supposed,51.149,3.721
to release sugar and the liver to kind,52.89,3.27
of stabilize the blood sugar so if,54.87,2.91
there's problems with the adrenal the,56.16,3.84
person will first have hypoglycemic low,57.78,4.82
blood sugar symptoms before they get,60.0,7.17
hyperglycemia a high sugar so high,62.6,7.269
amounts of insulin has direct side,67.17,3.96
effects which we're going to talk about,69.869,4.141
an indirect side effects depending,71.13,5.52
what's happening with hypoglycemia or,74.01,7.469
hyperglycemia okay so the direct side,76.65,6.39
effects from having high amounts of,81.479,4.261
insulin be cardiac hypertrophy where the,83.04,5.009
cells of the heart actually get bigger,85.74,4.559
like in cardiomegaly where the heart,88.049,3.96
doesn't fit into the chest cabin anymore,90.299,3.21
that creates a lot of problems with the,92.009,3.661
with the vessels and the valves and the,93.509,4.801
the actual work of the heart and the,95.67,4.199
function of the heart thrombus which is,98.31,3.9
a clot so when you have too much insulin,99.869,5.28
it really targets the large arteries to,102.21,5.519
the heart especially the wall of the,105.149,5.97
heart and it makes it stiff it actually,107.729,6.18
creates lesions it creates problems with,111.119,5.941
plaquing creates obstruction and,113.909,4.801
eventually will develop a clot it can,117.06,3.12
actually turn to a stroke or just have a,118.71,3.479
heart attack so high insulin is behind,120.18,6.06
most all inflammatory conditions turns,122.189,5.701
into diabetes causing the fatty liver,126.24,5.31
makes you fat and obesity causes the,127.89,5.01
cancer I'm going to put some links down,131.55,2.16
below,132.9,2.77
Alzheimer's because it affects the,133.71,3.34
dimension and plaquing of the brain,135.67,3.75
amyloid plaque II metabolic syndrome,137.05,3.57
which is a combination of some of these,139.42,3.24
we just talked about the ret now that's,140.62,6.15
the I nerve damage and kidney damage,142.66,6.51
other than that it's totally fine now,146.77,5.94
when you have diabetes type 1 which you,149.17,5.73
don't produce insulin anymore so,152.71,4.62
diabetics type 1 still have high insulin,154.9,4.92
because they're being given insulin,157.33,4.35
through an injection the ultimate goal,159.82,3.48
would be to decrease the amount of,161.68,3.45
insulin that your body uses so if you're,163.3,3.69
diabetic and you're on medication the,165.13,3.33
goal would be to take the least amount,166.99,3.75
possible if you're not a diabetic,168.46,4.32
is to eliminate the foods that are,170.74,4.2
triggering insulin so I put a link down,172.78,4.59
below exactly how to do that thanks for,174.94,3.53
