hi guys I doing a roleplay yesterday,0.24,3.03
with someone and they were thinking,1.86,3.03
about starting metformin as part of,3.27,3.54
someone's type 2 diabetes management so,4.89,3.029
I thought a really quick video on the,6.81,3.78
dosing as per BNF that you'd be,7.919,4.321
suggesting when you start metformin and,10.59,3.209
also some of the side effects that you,12.24,3.569
may be counseling a patient for in a,13.799,3.781
medical exam roleplay or if you get it,15.809,4.05
in a medical exam question so metformin,17.58,4.59
for an adults generally started the dose,19.859,5.191
of 500 milligrams once a day for a week,22.17,4.439
and you advise that you take that at,25.05,3.569
breakfast time then you move on to the,26.609,4.861
second week 500 milligrams BD for the,28.619,5.19
second week doses at breakfast and with,31.47,4.65
your evening meal and then thirdly you,33.809,5.611
go into 500 milligrams TDS one dose of,36.12,4.92
breakfast wanders at lunch and then one,39.42,3.0
dose with your evening meal II remember,41.04,3.089
the maximum dose asked for the B and F,42.42,5.61
is 2 grams in a day but in divided doses,44.129,7.351
so that's the general starting regime,48.03,4.95
but of course people with renal function,51.48,2.7
for example this is different you may be,52.98,2.94
altering that with another video on,54.18,3.6
renal function or metformin but that's,55.92,3.63
your general adult dose what about,57.78,3.119
counseling for side effects generally is,59.55,3.27
GI stuff really so think about the low,60.899,3.781
source of GI problems nausea vomiting,62.82,4.35
loose stool abdominal pain reduced,64.68,3.84
appetite also things like taste,67.17,2.91
disturbance can commonly happen since,68.52,2.88
was counseling about these things of,70.08,3.149
course there are some rarer things like,71.4,4.77
hepatitis lactic acidosis generally,73.229,4.53
those are very rare but GI things are,76.17,4.08
pretty common especially early on with,77.759,4.351
metformin so have a look at the BLF an,80.25,4.77
IC KS for more information dosing and,82.11,4.77
side effects of metformin much more,85.02,3.87
pharmacology on our online courses and,86.88,4.05
our audiobook courses hash tag campus,88.89,6.74
will pass hash tag I went with Aurora,90.93,4.7
