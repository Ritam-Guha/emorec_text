hi welcome to physionic where we learn,0.08,4.239
the body from the macro to the micro,1.92,4.16
in this content we'll be looking into,4.319,3.281
some science on how,6.08,3.84
varying lengths of water fasting affects,7.6,4.24
blood sugar levels as well as blood,9.92,3.04
glycation,11.84,4.56
known as hba1c measure learn,12.96,7.52
your body a science-based education,16.4,6.4
this content is brought to us by a study,20.48,4.08
i will have linked for you as well as my,22.8,4.399
notes and any content amendments,24.56,4.719
briefly a bit on the study design before,27.199,4.08
we get to the results,29.279,4.001
this study was prospective meaning the,31.279,3.761
researchers did not implement any,33.28,3.76
intervention and simply followed,35.04,3.679
people already committing to a water,37.04,3.92
fast under the supervision of personnel,38.719,4.401
at a fasting institution,40.96,4.72
participants of the study chose to fast,43.12,3.84
for either 5,45.68,4.64
10 15 or 20 days in a row,46.96,5.599
and had to be in generally good health,50.32,3.84
although participants tended to be,52.559,2.48
overweight,54.16,3.44
and had some blood pressure issues,55.039,3.04
although,57.6,2.4
a straight water fast would have been,58.079,4.401
preferable all participants consumed a,60.0,4.64
200 calorie soup each day,62.48,4.4
but the rest of the time they consumed,64.64,3.36
water,66.88,2.64
measurements were taken before the,68.0,3.439
beginning of the study therefore before,69.52,2.72
the fast,71.439,2.241
and then again at the end of their,72.24,3.04
respective fasts,73.68,3.68
unfortunately there were significant,75.28,3.68
weight differences between,77.36,4.799
the 5 10 15 and 20 day conditions,78.96,5.36
pre-study which makes the comparisons,82.159,4.481
between the groups difficult but we will,84.32,3.68
still be able to compare their,86.64,3.119
pre-fasting measures to their,88.0,3.2
post-fasting measures,89.759,4.561
and now let's look at the study data,91.2,5.76
blood glucose sugar was separated out,94.32,3.119
between,96.96,3.36
men and women with women being open,97.439,4.0
circles and men,100.32,4.0
being dark triangles in both sexes there,101.439,4.96
was a significant decline in blood,104.32,3.68
glucose after only,106.399,4.0
five days of fasting which did not,108.0,4.399
decrease further with longer fasting,110.399,2.801
periods,112.399,2.881
implying the effect is rapid and does,113.2,4.72
not follow a dose response relationship,115.28,4.799
meaning more fasting does not bring,117.92,3.92
about better results,120.079,5.441
shifting to hba1c a marker of glycation,121.84,6.639
otherwise stated a marker of sugar being,125.52,4.48
attached to hemoglobin,128.479,4.161
a key protein in red blood cells which,130.0,4.0
is an indication of a,132.64,4.319
long-term blood glucose pathology as,134.0,4.319
elevated a1c,136.959,2.801
indicates the blood cells are,138.319,3.92
continuously traveling in a high blood,139.76,3.199
glucose,142.239,2.72
and spontaneously being tagged with,142.959,4.561
sugars in a pathological manner making,144.959,4.241
them less functional,147.52,4.64
the data here showed the exact same,149.2,3.44
trend,152.16,3.12
as with regular blood sugar measure an,152.64,3.52
immediate,155.28,3.76
decrease a good sign with five days of,156.16,5.04
fasting and no added improvement,159.04,5.199
with 20 days of fasting so this data,161.2,3.92
tells us that,164.239,2.881
water fasting is a potent reducer of,165.12,4.24
blood sugar in men and women alike,167.12,4.16
and this effect is quick happening,169.36,3.68
within the first five days,171.28,4.72
and not compounding over time meaning,173.04,5.199
the effect after five days is the same,176.0,3.28
effect size,178.239,4.481
seen after 15 or 20 days of fasting,179.28,5.36
with that said that is what i have for,182.72,3.36
you and i hope to have the absolute,184.64,2.8
pleasure of speaking with you,186.08,13.76
in the near future bye,187.44,12.4
you,206.56,2.08
