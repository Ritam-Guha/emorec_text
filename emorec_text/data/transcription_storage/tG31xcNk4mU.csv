hello i'm libby dowling clinical advisor,1.199,4.001
at diabetes uk,3.439,3.761
this video will show you how to inject,5.2,3.68
insulin safely,7.2,3.519
it's important to remember that people,8.88,4.0
will take different types of insulin at,10.719,4.241
different times and different amounts,12.88,4.319
during the day and that's decided in,14.96,5.2
conjunction with your healthcare team,17.199,5.121
insulin is injected just under the skin,20.16,5.52
it doesn't go deep into a muscle or vein,22.32,6.4
the main sites for injecting insulin are,25.68,6.08
your stomach so that's in a semicircle,28.72,5.519
underneath your belly button,31.76,5.12
your thighs the front,34.239,5.041
or the side,36.88,4.72
and your buttocks,39.28,4.32
some people might also inject in their,41.6,5.6
arms so that's not always recommended,43.6,5.52
it's really important that you rotate,47.2,4.16
the place that you do your injection and,49.12,4.72
all of those sites have quite a quite a,51.36,4.56
wide surface area so it's important that,53.84,4.239
you choose a different spot within each,55.92,3.84
site,58.079,4.32
injecting too often into the same place,59.76,4.479
will cause hard lumps to appear under,62.399,5.361
the skin that's called lipo hypertrophy,64.239,5.361
the lumps can stop the insulin being,67.76,3.679
absorbed properly and that will mean,69.6,3.519
that your diabetes won't be as well,71.439,3.441
managed as it might be,73.119,4.32
a typical injecting kit consists of an,74.88,3.84
insulin pen,77.439,5.121
which might be a reusable one,78.72,3.84
or a disposable one,82.96,5.12
in a disposable pen the insulin comes as,85.28,4.8
an integral part of it,88.08,4.48
in a reusable pen you will need to fit,90.08,5.52
an insulin cartridge separately,92.56,5.68
there will also be a needle that fits on,95.6,7.12
to the end of the pen like that,98.24,4.48
it's really important that you dispose,103.119,4.481
of all the sharps very very safely for,104.799,5.521
that you can either use a needle clipper,107.6,4.64
which clips off the sharp point of the,110.32,5.2
needle and stores it safely inside,112.24,5.199
and there's also a sharp spin,115.52,3.36
where you can throw the entire needle,117.439,3.36
away,118.88,3.76
all of these items are available on,120.799,5.201
prescription from your healthcare team,122.64,5.679
follow these simple steps to inject,126.0,5.28
safely using an insulin pen,128.319,6.081
wash your hands with soap and warm water,131.28,6.64
rinse and dry prime the pen,134.4,6.4
attach the needle to your insulin pen,137.92,6.0
dial up to two units and hold the pen,140.8,4.72
upright,143.92,3.92
press the plunger,145.52,4.24
insulin should appear at the tip of the,147.84,3.2
needle,149.76,2.479
if not,151.04,4.72
repeat the process until it does,152.239,6.241
set the pen to your dose,155.76,4.8
turn the knob until you see the correct,158.48,3.119
dose,160.56,2.959
choose which part of your body you're,161.599,4.241
going to inject,163.519,4.481
if you've been advised to,165.84,5.36
gently lift the skin with your free hand,168.0,8.08
and insert the pen at a 90 degree angle,171.2,7.44
gently push down on the plunger until,176.08,6.0
the pen goes back to zero,178.64,6.08
count to ten slowly,182.08,5.519
pull the needle slowly out of the skin,184.72,6.56
and release the skin fold,187.599,6.241
take the needle off the end of the pen,191.28,6.72
and dispose of it safely in a sharp spin,193.84,5.759
a lot of people are nervous about,198.0,3.84
injecting insulin to start with but as,199.599,3.761
you've done it a few times and your,201.84,3.52
confidence grows for most people they,203.36,4.72
get over their fears quite quickly,205.36,6.799
vary your injection site,208.08,8.4
use a new needle each time you inject,212.159,4.321
count to 10 before you remove the needle,217.92,5.039
