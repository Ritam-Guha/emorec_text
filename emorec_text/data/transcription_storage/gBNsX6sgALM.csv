hey how far is it to the farmers market,0.03,4.499
about 15 minutes from here this is an,2.25,4.2
example of how sometimes we ask a,4.529,4.201
question using one measure the distance,6.45,4.2
to the farmers market and answer it,8.73,3.72
using a different measure while it is,10.65,3.75
convenient to describe the travel time,12.45,4.05
to the market and make some assumptions,14.4,4.17
about our mode of transportation and it,16.5,3.72
doesn't actually use the units of,18.57,5.4
distance body mass index or BMI is kind,20.22,6.54
of like that for our health BMI is used,23.97,4.889
as an indicator of body fat to assess,26.76,4.439
disease risk but it doesn't actually,28.859,5.311
measure body fat so why is BMI the go-to,31.199,11.79
marker hey nerville I'm dr. Laura body,34.17,12.15
mass index abbreviated as BMI is used as,42.989,5.851
an indicator for body fat BMI is,46.32,4.44
calculated by dividing your weight in,48.84,3.48
kilograms by your height in meters,50.76,3.24
squared to give you a value that,52.32,3.12
determines your weight category,54.0,3.93
according to the CDC a healthy weight,55.44,4.83
BMI is eighteen point five to twenty,57.93,4.62
four point nine underweight as below,60.27,4.889
eighteen point five overweight as twenty,62.55,4.889
five to twenty nine point nine and obese,65.159,4.201
is greater than thirty you can use an,67.439,4.11
online calculator to determine your BMI,69.36,4.259
then you can avoid those pesky unit,71.549,4.801
conversions as you can see BMI is really,73.619,4.771
quick and easy to calculate so it's been,76.35,3.78
used to monitor obesity trends in,78.39,3.72
populations and to screen patients and,80.13,3.96
doctors offices research studies have,82.11,4.23
consistently demonstrated that a BMI in,84.09,4.529
the obese range strongly correlates with,86.34,4.56
many chronic diseases including type-2,88.619,4.621
diabetes cardiovascular disease and,90.9,4.679
metabolic syndrome however correlation,93.24,4.559
is not causation and it turns out that,95.579,4.741
BMI has many caveats when used to screen,97.799,4.081
for health conditions related to body,100.32,4.259
fat first BMI can't differentiate,101.88,5.07
between body fat and lean body mass,104.579,5.131
which is the weight of your bones organs,106.95,5.58
and muscles at the population level BMI,109.71,5.339
does correlate with body fat but this,112.53,4.17
isn't always the case at the individual,115.049,3.871
level for example athletes tend to have,116.7,4.199
more muscle mass which is heavier than,118.92,4.86
fat so sometimes their BMI classifies,120.899,4.981
them as overweight or obese despite,123.78,4.019
being very healthy the opposite is also,125.88,3.96
true in elderly individuals who tend to,127.799,2.82
lose muscle,129.84,2.58
and replace it with fact meaning that,130.619,3.93
they may have a healthy BMI despite a,132.42,4.95
high percent body fat second the BMI,134.549,4.5
weight categories were originally,137.37,3.449
determined using research on white,139.049,3.631
subjects different ethnicities have,140.819,3.871
variations in body composition and,142.68,4.35
metabolism meaning that the obese BMI,144.69,4.56
range should be different by ethnicity,147.03,4.11
for example if we look at a white woman,149.25,4.26
a black woman and an Asian woman who all,151.14,5.28
have the same BMI the black woman would,153.51,5.039
have a lower risk of type 2 diabetes and,156.42,4.2
the Asian woman would have a higher risk,158.549,4.711
compared to the white woman third BMI,160.62,4.52
doesn't indicate body fat distribution,163.26,4.289
it's not just the percentage of total,165.14,4.87
body fat but rather where that fat is,167.549,4.201
located on the body that plays a,170.01,3.63
causative role in disease development,171.75,4.29
central obesity is the accumulation of,173.64,4.53
fat around the abdomen this deep belly,176.04,4.529
fat also called visceral fat functions,178.17,4.17
differently than the subcutaneous fat,180.569,3.361
that is immediately under our skin,182.34,3.479
visceral fat tends to be more,183.93,4.05
inflammatory and less sensitive to the,185.819,4.771
hormone insulin factors which drive the,187.98,4.53
development of diseases like type 2,190.59,3.959
diabetes and cardiovascular disease,192.51,3.99
there are some alternative measures to,194.549,3.331
assess body fat that are better,196.5,3.239
predictors of disease risk waist,197.88,3.84
circumference more directly measures,199.739,3.571
central obesity so it's a better,201.72,3.66
reflection of body fat distribution at,203.31,4.44
high risk areas currently American,205.38,4.439
organizations classify central obesity,207.75,4.139
as a waist circumference greater than 35,209.819,4.2
inches in women and greater than 40,211.889,4.291
inches in men the International Diabetes,214.019,4.11
Federation has published separate,216.18,4.38
classifications by ethnicity to take,218.129,4.5
body composition variation into account,220.56,4.2
waist circumference is not perfect and,222.629,3.841
there are many other more direct,224.76,3.72
measures of body fat that are useful in,226.47,4.049
research settings but not feasible at,228.48,4.349
the population or clinical level BMI is,230.519,4.5
a convenient but inaccurate measure,232.829,4.171
especially when applied to individuals,235.019,4.05
waist circumference is equivalently,237.0,4.199
feasible to measure and may be a better,239.069,3.991
tool at both the population and,241.199,3.63
individual level because it more,243.06,3.78
directly assesses the causative factors,244.829,3.78
of central obesity both of these,246.84,3.899
measures are meant for screening only,248.609,5.011
and not as diagnostic tools regardless,250.739,4.981
of your BMI or waist circumference there,253.62,3.51
are some behaviors that should be the,255.72,3.359
foundation of all healthy lifestyles,257.13,3.5
