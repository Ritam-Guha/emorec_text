hello everyone and welcome back to,0.399,2.881
clinical cousins youtube channel where,1.599,4.001
today we are going to go over the drug,3.28,6.08
insulin aspart also known as nova log,5.6,6.32
this drug is classified as a rapid,9.36,4.72
acting insulin and is given for,11.92,3.839
hyperglycemia,14.08,5.119
remember that nova log leaves no time,15.759,7.6
for hyperglycemia or that insulin aspart,19.199,7.281
starts a working a very fast,23.359,5.68
now it cannot be mixed with other,26.48,6.079
insulins besides nph insulin,29.039,5.841
and in pregnant women this drug has not,32.559,4.321
yet been proven safe,34.88,4.4
now what we need to know,36.88,5.839
is that this drug will bind to our,39.28,6.24
transmembrane receptors and start a,42.719,5.201
cascade of actions that eventually,45.52,5.519
result in the placement of glute4,47.92,4.4
transporters,51.039,3.761
in to our cell membrane,52.32,4.64
this allows glucose,54.8,4.559
to enter the cells by facilitated,56.96,3.759
diffusion,59.359,4.0
this also means that the glucose level,60.719,7.121
in the plasma will decrease,63.359,7.281
now it is very important that we know,67.84,6.08
that insulin has another very important,70.64,4.4
action,73.92,4.08
it will make the potassium leave the,75.04,6.079
blood and enter our cells,78.0,6.08
insulin activates a train of reactions,81.119,5.281
that eventually stimulate,84.08,5.92
our sodium potassium atpases,86.4,7.12
remember that these atp aces push sodium,90.0,6.4
out of the cell and bring potassium into,93.52,4.32
the cell,96.4,4.399
this is very important because food has,97.84,6.959
a lot of glucose and potassium,100.799,6.721
if our bodies were to simply absorb all,104.799,4.64
of this potassium and do nothing about,107.52,5.279
it it would cause us to have a paralytic,109.439,5.04
arrhythmia,112.799,4.881
this is why it is a smart idea to intake,114.479,6.801
glucose and potassium at the same time,117.68,6.0
you should be aware that your patient's,121.28,5.56
insulin need will increase as their body,123.68,5.76
experiences stressors,126.84,5.72
these stressors are things like surgery,129.44,4.72
sickness,132.56,4.319
trauma or fever,134.16,5.68
also be aware of the possibility of,136.879,5.161
developing a temporary,139.84,6.72
hypokalemia when you administer insulin,142.04,7.4
what you need to know is that this drug,146.56,6.16
has an onset of 10 minutes,149.44,6.32
a peak of 2 hours,152.72,3.68
and,155.76,4.96
effects or duration of 5 hours,156.4,8.08
remember that the nova log address is 10,160.72,5.44
to 5,164.48,5.2
onset in 10 minutes,166.16,8.159
in two hours or the lowest blood glucose,169.68,8.0
and it will last for five hours,174.319,5.2
the side effects of this drug may,177.68,3.0
include,179.519,3.761
hypoglycemia that can result in,180.68,6.12
pallor and tachycardia,183.28,4.64
weight gain,186.8,1.92
and,187.92,4.239
lipo hypertrophy at the injection site,188.72,5.2
some commonly tested material about this,192.159,5.36
drug is that it is a rapid acting,193.92,4.72
insulin,197.519,1.921
and,198.64,4.64
novolog leaves no time for hyperglycemia,199.44,7.519
remember that the address is 10 to 5,203.28,7.28
onset of 10 minutes peak of 2 hours and,206.959,5.521
duration of five hours,210.56,2.72
and,212.48,3.039
lastly please remember that this drug,213.28,4.72
will rapidly decrease your patients,215.519,6.481
blood glucose and blood potassium levels,218.0,5.92
as always thank you for taking the time,222.0,3.44
