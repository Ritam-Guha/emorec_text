hello i'm dr. sanjay panicum I found it,5.87,6.07
Ambra Tommy apathy in 1997 in a small,9.12,5.34
town in Kerala later be expanded to,11.94,4.23
Bangalore and right now we have two,14.46,3.81
clinics in Koramangala and Merritt,16.17,4.38
Holley we specialize in hair and skin,18.27,5.249
problems respiratory problems pediatrics,20.55,6.41
allergies and infertility homeopathy can,23.519,6.901
reverse peripheral neuropathy provided,26.96,6.04
peripheral neuropathy is detected in the,30.42,4.53
early stages of the patient comes to us,33.0,3.66
in the early stages of the disease as,34.95,4.019
the disease progresses and it becomes,36.66,3.899
more and more advanced it becomes,38.969,4.201
difficult to cure peripheral neuropathy,40.559,5.011
completely we can palliate it but in the,43.17,4.08
early stages I have many patients who,45.57,3.809
have got completely cured of peripheral,47.25,4.11
neuropathy now it is important to,49.379,3.901
identify what are the symptoms or which,51.36,3.929
are the areas that peripheral neuropathy,53.28,3.54
is affecting and what are the causes,55.289,4.29
behind it as we know that nutritional,56.82,5.039
deficiency is one of the primary causes,59.579,3.78
where a lot of patients do come to us,61.859,2.91
with peripheral neuropathy,63.359,5.431
it is commonly seen in diabetics that is,64.769,5.911
one of the major systemic disease which,68.79,4.14
can cause peripheral neuropathy it is,70.68,4.38
also seen in alcoholics who have a,72.93,4.11
constant habit of drinking alcohol and,75.06,4.98
so the B complex dips because a,77.04,4.619
bacterial flora is destroyed so,80.04,4.11
absorption of nutrients reduce so when B,81.659,4.261
complex dips peripheral neuropathy,84.15,4.14
happens and the other reason can be,85.92,5.1
endurance whenever there is an injury of,88.29,6.869
the nerves which supplies the peripheral,91.02,6.75
areas then there can be peripheral,95.159,4.32
neuropathy so correction and treatment,97.77,3.27
of the injury using medicines like,99.479,5.1
arnica is very helpful also we have,101.04,7.02
various other reasons why peripheral,104.579,5.881
neuropathy may happen like for example,108.06,3.72
when the weather is really bad,110.46,4.199
very cold weathers frostbite can cause,111.78,6.24
peripheral neuropathy we also based on,114.659,6.151
the area affected we can use the right,118.02,5.76
homeopathic medicine which can cure,120.81,5.339
peripheral neuropathy for example when,123.78,3.869
bladder is affected and there is,126.149,2.42
peripheral Europe,127.649,2.601
then caustic um is one of the major,128.569,4.681
remedy which is used when extremities,130.25,4.95
fingers there is burning of the palms,133.25,4.65
and the soles then we use medicines like,135.2,6.929
sulphur Midori nam vipera or crotalus,137.9,8.399
horridest or lattices hydrops these are,142.129,5.761
the medicines which is used in,146.299,3.451
peripheral neuropathy based on the,147.89,3.9
symptoms which a physician can rightly,149.75,6.329
identify again if there is due to injury,151.79,6.779
then arnica as I told you hyper recom is,156.079,4.891
again very useful in peripheral,158.569,4.95
neuropathy so this is how we can treat,160.97,5.159
and cure if you identify the cause and,163.519,5.071
treat using the medicines treating the,166.129,5.371
cause along with a constitutional,168.59,5.22
approach then constitutional mix which,171.5,4.379
covers the whole symptoms of the person,173.81,3.81
then peripheral neuropathy can be,175.879,3.991
connected if diabetes is there treat,177.62,4.11
diabetes to along with the homeopathic,179.87,4.41
medicines for peripheral neuropathy so,181.73,5.14
that went acylation,184.28,6.279
