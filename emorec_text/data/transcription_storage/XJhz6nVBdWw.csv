i'm dr hill,6.72,4.08
a bariatric surgeon with live healthy md,8.0,4.08
and today we're going to talk about the,10.8,3.28
gastric bypass,12.08,4.0
the gastric bypass is the second most,14.08,4.88
commonly performed weight loss procedure,16.08,4.48
weight loss surgeons have been doing,18.96,4.399
this operation for over 40 years,20.56,5.039
the first bypass procedure was performed,23.359,3.76
in the 1960s,25.599,3.76
and began as an open procedure meaning,27.119,4.48
doctors would make a large incision,29.359,5.121
in the abdomen to perform the surgery,31.599,4.881
although the morbidity and mortality,34.48,4.239
rates were low for these open bypass,36.48,3.36
procedures,38.719,3.201
they resulted in more wound related,39.84,3.36
complications,41.92,5.36
such as infections in the early 2000s,43.2,5.6
surgeons made the transition to,47.28,3.04
performing the bypass and,48.8,3.48
other bariatric procedures,50.32,3.36
laparoscopically,52.28,3.24
which is the only surgical technique we,53.68,4.48
use in our practice today,55.52,5.199
the gastric bypass is a result of,58.16,4.559
dividing and stapling the stomach to,60.719,3.281
create a smaller,62.719,4.961
upper pouch about the size of an egg,64.0,5.92
that is separate from the large main,67.68,3.119
stomach,69.92,3.68
the operation also involves rerounding,70.799,4.0
the intestines,73.6,2.96
so that the main part of the stomach in,74.799,3.68
the first part of the small intestine,76.56,5.12
is bypassed as a result,78.479,5.28
food and digestive juices will travel,81.68,4.799
down separate limbs of intestines,83.759,4.72
this altered anatomy allows an,86.479,4.081
individual to consume smaller portions,88.479,4.161
due to a smaller stomach size,90.56,4.879
while also absorbing fewer calories as,92.64,5.04
much as the intestines are bypassed,95.439,4.241
however we also believe that there are,97.68,4.16
more important mechanisms in play,99.68,4.719
that will result in weight loss we have,101.84,4.48
seen that when food is prevented,104.399,3.601
from touching the lining of the first,106.32,3.28
part of the intestines,108.0,3.04
hormones that help regulate your,109.6,3.519
metabolism are altered,111.04,4.56
this allows individuals to lose weight,113.119,4.161
when it was previously not possible,115.6,2.159
through,117.28,3.04
other conscious means since the,117.759,4.801
digestion process is altered with the,120.32,3.68
gastric bypass,122.56,3.04
this can result in nutritional,124.0,3.04
deficiencies,125.6,4.159
therefore is critical to take your,127.04,4.32
vitamins and supplements,129.759,3.761
after bariatric surgery to prevent,131.36,5.2
significant nutrient deficiencies,133.52,5.52
also the gastric bypass can cause,136.56,4.08
dumping syndrome,139.04,3.919
dumping syndrome is a result of eating,140.64,3.12
high sugar,142.959,2.961
foods that move through the body too,143.76,3.119
fast,145.92,3.6
resulting in loose bowel movements this,146.879,5.521
can be managed by eating a healthy diet,149.52,5.28
like all surgical procedures the gastric,152.4,5.36
bypass does come with its risks,154.8,5.12
major complications that could result in,157.76,3.119
re-operation,159.92,4.72
include internal bleeding bowel leaks,160.879,6.801
or bowel obstruction other complications,164.64,4.879
that would not require re-operation,167.68,3.839
include blood clots in a leg,169.519,5.44
a pulmonary embolism or ulcers,171.519,5.681
although scary these complications are,174.959,3.841
rare and occur in less than,177.2,4.48
one percent of our patients minor,178.8,4.88
complications after surgery might also,181.68,2.72
occur,183.68,3.36
such as wound infections vomiting or,184.4,3.68
nausea,187.04,4.32
acid reflux also known as heartburn or,188.08,5.04
changes in the bowel habits such as,191.36,2.879
constipation,193.12,4.479
bloating or gas these complications,194.239,6.08
are also uncommon and can be managed,197.599,4.161
fairly easily without,200.319,3.92
further surgery as a patient goes,201.76,3.52
through our program,204.239,2.801
we will make sure that they fully,205.28,4.0
understand all the potential risks,207.04,5.04
associated with their procedure the,209.28,5.039
gastric bypass procedure takes about one,212.08,3.36
hour to perform,214.319,3.28
and patients can expect to stay at the,215.44,4.24
hospital for up to 48 hours,217.599,4.56
after surgery depending on the type of,219.68,3.76
work performed,222.159,2.881
patients will be able to return to work,223.44,4.64
within one to four weeks from surgery,225.04,5.68
patients who have gastric bypass surgery,228.08,3.84
can expect to lose,230.72,3.92
70 to 75 percent of their excess body,231.92,3.2
weight,234.64,4.0
within the first year about 75 percent,235.12,5.52
of patients who undergo gastric bypass,238.64,2.64
surgery,240.64,3.44
are able to keep off at least 50 percent,241.28,4.879
of their excess weight for 10 years or,244.08,3.12
longer,246.159,3.36
other benefits of gastric bypass surgery,247.2,3.52
aside from weight loss,249.519,4.161
include better health and an improvement,250.72,3.84
or,253.68,3.679
resolution of serious health conditions,254.56,4.959
long-term cost savings as a result of,257.359,3.84
reduced medical care,259.519,3.201
and an improvement in a patient's,261.199,3.121
quality of life,262.72,3.84
studies have shown that patients who,264.32,3.92
have had bariatric surgery,266.56,3.68
feel better and spend more time during,268.24,3.2
recreational,270.24,4.16
and physical activities similarly,271.44,4.88
patients who have lost a significant,274.4,3.04
amount of weight,276.32,3.52
experience more self-confidence and are,277.44,4.64
more likely to become more social,279.84,4.56
the gastric bypass is a highly effective,282.08,3.92
bariatric procedure that can help,284.4,3.44
patients achieve their weight goal,286.0,3.759
despite this complicated nature of this,287.84,3.919
procedure it is reversible,289.759,8.081
and is able to be revised as needed,291.759,6.081
