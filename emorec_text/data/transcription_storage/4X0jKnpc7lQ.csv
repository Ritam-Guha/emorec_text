hi it's tracy if you have diabetes in,0.32,4.56
pregnancy one of the things you're,3.36,3.28
probably wondering is,4.88,4.639
what effect high blood sugar has on the,6.64,3.84
baby,9.519,3.2
and there's several answers to that,10.48,5.73
let's dig in,12.719,4.961
[Music],16.21,3.229
one of the first things to remember is,17.68,3.679
that babies blood sugars,19.439,3.6
are going to be pretty close to whatever,21.359,3.281
your blood sugar level is,23.039,4.32
at any given time and if the baby's,24.64,4.559
getting all this glucose from you,27.359,4.72
then right after delivery when the cord,29.199,4.161
is clamped and cut,32.079,3.361
then their blood sugars just plummet,33.36,3.84
because they're still making all this,35.44,2.4
insulin,37.2,2.96
trying to get their blood sugars down,37.84,3.84
and if they're not getting the glucose,40.16,3.6
anymore then their blood sugars go way,41.68,2.719
down,43.76,2.319
this is a problem sometimes in the,44.399,3.041
newborn period,46.079,3.441
so you'll be asked to feed your baby,47.44,3.439
right away,49.52,3.199
put the baby right to the breast or,50.879,3.36
however you're going to feed the baby,52.719,3.201
the baby is going to need some source of,54.239,4.0
glucose very shortly after delivery,55.92,4.4
to keep the blood sugars from going down,58.239,3.441
so one thing you should be thinking,60.32,1.84
about,61.68,2.24
when you're managing your diabetes in,62.16,4.319
pregnancy is how those high blood sugars,63.92,4.879
are making the baby's blood sugars high,66.479,4.32
and in the last few weeks leading up to,68.799,3.281
delivery how important,70.799,4.401
it is to keep your blood sugars solid,72.08,4.8
so that the baby's blood sugars don't,75.2,3.44
fall right after delivery,76.88,3.44
some babies have to get admitted to the,78.64,3.2
intensive care nursery for this,80.32,3.6
sometimes they require iv,81.84,4.72
fluids and iv glucose just to manage,83.92,3.04
this,86.56,2.4
the second thing to remember is that,86.96,3.04
babies grow,88.96,3.68
bigger when moms have high blood sugar,90.0,3.92
and here's the reason,92.64,2.88
they're getting a lot of blood sugar,93.92,3.76
from you if your sugars are high,95.52,4.239
that glucose kind of slides downhill to,97.68,4.079
the baby and when their glucoses are,99.759,4.081
elevated they make a lot more insulin,101.759,3.68
and along with that insulin they're,103.84,2.08
making,105.439,2.801
all kinds of hormones that make them,105.92,3.04
store,108.24,3.68
fat so the same way that you gain weight,108.96,4.56
when you eat too many calories or,111.92,2.159
especially,113.52,2.959
too many carbs the babies are starting,114.079,3.921
to put on weight too,116.479,3.841
and that in turn leads to an increased,118.0,3.84
risk of birth injuries,120.32,3.439
the head is supposed to be the biggest,121.84,3.84
part of a baby and it's supposed to come,123.759,3.761
out first so that the rest of the body,125.68,2.48
just slides,127.52,2.879
right out when you have diabetes in,128.16,4.24
pregnancy and if your blood sugars are,130.399,2.801
high,132.4,2.88
then baby's blood sugars are high and,133.2,3.759
they tend to put on more weight,135.28,3.84
through the shoulders and abdomen and,136.959,4.241
what this means for the birth process,139.12,4.56
is that the head's not the biggest part,141.2,4.32
of the baby anymore and sometimes the,143.68,2.96
head comes out,145.52,3.04
and then the shoulder and abdomen don't,146.64,4.08
want to come out and that's a condition,148.56,4.319
called shoulder dystocia and it's,150.72,3.2
terrifying for,152.879,4.161
your provider and for you because those,153.92,3.84
seconds,157.04,3.279
that it takes to do the maneuvers to get,157.76,4.16
the baby to come on out,160.319,3.601
and while that's happening the baby's,161.92,4.48
not getting any blood flow or oxygen,163.92,4.48
so we want the head to stay the biggest,166.4,3.119
part of the baby,168.4,2.4
keep your blood sugars under good,169.519,3.681
control the third effect that your high,170.8,4.32
blood sugar can have on the baby,173.2,3.679
is really part of the second thing when,175.12,3.759
babies are born big they're more likely,176.879,2.881
to have birth,178.879,3.921
injuries so remember that the shoulders,179.76,5.199
can have a difficult time delivering,182.8,4.719
and when that happens they can have,184.959,3.761
shoulder injuries,187.519,3.521
most of the time these are temporary but,188.72,3.599
sometimes they can cause,191.04,4.0
lasting damage the fourth effect that,192.319,4.64
your high blood sugar can have on your,195.04,2.72
baby,196.959,3.761
involves the baby's childhood risk of,197.76,5.44
metabolic disorders and obesity,200.72,5.12
so we've known for a long time that,203.2,4.64
children of diabetic mothers,205.84,4.319
tend to have a higher risk of obesity,207.84,4.8
and developing diabetes themselves,210.159,4.0
but we've thought that that's just,212.64,4.239
because of lifestyle factors,214.159,4.961
so moms that don't eat well or take care,216.879,3.36
of themselves well,219.12,4.0
teach those habits to their children and,220.239,4.64
then the children grow up with poor,223.12,3.759
eating habits or nutritional habits,224.879,4.64
what we know now is that even if you,226.879,3.681
feed your children,229.519,3.681
perfectly after delivery your blood,230.56,4.72
sugars during the pregnancy have a,233.2,5.119
lasting sometimes lifelong effect on the,235.28,4.8
baby's metabolism and their,238.319,4.081
risk of becoming diabetic or having a,240.08,3.12
problem with,242.4,3.28
obesity starting in childhood the last,243.2,3.92
complication is the most,245.68,4.24
serious one if your glucoses are not,247.12,4.56
well controlled in pregnancy and your,249.92,3.2
baby's growing bigger,251.68,3.44
or your glucoses are bouncing around,253.12,4.56
going from very high to very low,255.12,4.56
there's an increased risk of stillbirth,257.68,4.079
and that means a pregnancy loss,259.68,4.16
the closer you get to your due date and,261.759,3.601
the longer your glucoses are,263.84,2.32
uncontrolled,265.36,3.52
the higher this risk becomes fortunately,266.16,5.28
stillbirth is a rare event but i don't,268.88,4.319
want this to happen to you,271.44,4.08
so you can see that having high blood,273.199,3.921
sugar in pregnancy,275.52,4.0
has an effect on your baby not just now,277.12,4.4
but sometimes all through childhood and,279.52,3.679
even lifelong,281.52,4.48
so remember when you have diabetes in,283.199,4.881
pregnancy it's so important for you to,286.0,3.28
follow your diet,288.08,2.96
for you to have regular check-ins with,289.28,4.08
your provider and keep your glucoses,291.04,3.84
under the best control,293.36,3.6
possible i'm excited to announce that,294.88,4.319
