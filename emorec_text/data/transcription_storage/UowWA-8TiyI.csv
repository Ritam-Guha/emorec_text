hello ladies and gentlemen dr ravi,11.92,3.52
shanker senior endocrinologist apollo,13.599,3.6
hospitals jupiter hills hyderabad is,15.44,2.24
here to,17.199,4.641
discuss about what is bmi bmi stands for,17.68,6.4
body mass index it is a way of,21.84,3.599
standardizing,24.08,3.84
and teasing out if one is really,25.439,4.08
overweight,27.92,5.04
weight in kilos divided by height,29.519,6.56
in meter square for example if somebody,32.96,5.439
were to be 170 centimeters,36.079,7.441
you multiply that twice 1.7 into 1.7,38.399,7.921
okay and you take the weight for example,43.52,4.879
if the weight is around 70 kilos you,46.32,4.8
divide 70 kilos by whatever you get,48.399,6.401
as a product of multiplying 1.7 into 1.7,51.12,6.4
you get a value it could be 23 for,54.8,3.599
example,57.52,4.24
so if somebody were to be falling within,58.399,5.041
a certain bracket,61.76,4.48
then you can call them as not being,63.44,4.4
overweight for example if you're less,66.24,2.72
than 25,67.84,4.08
then you're fine if if are less than say,68.96,3.76
18,71.92,2.879
then you are very thin and you're,72.72,3.759
underweight if your,74.799,4.081
bmi is more than 25 yeah you're,76.479,3.521
definitely more than,78.88,3.76
what you shouldn't be and if you're more,80.0,3.52
than 30,82.64,3.68
then definitely you're obese and again,83.52,3.36
you know,86.32,4.56
if your weight is say more than 35 or,86.88,6.879
40 then you can call it as very obese or,90.88,4.32
morbidly obese so there is a,93.759,2.801
classification,95.2,2.879
for this you don't have to remember all,96.56,3.04
this classification but,98.079,4.481
body mass index is a way of measuring if,99.6,3.68
somebody is,102.56,2.72
overweight or not and this is a,103.28,3.04
standardized,105.28,3.839
way of doing it because somebody could,106.32,3.68
be,109.119,4.0
very tall and they could be 80 kilo 80,110.0,4.479
kilos,113.119,3.201
you can't call that individual as,114.479,3.761
overweight but if somebody who is,116.32,5.6
only um say five feet height,118.24,7.04
and is 70 kilos in weight that person,121.92,5.28
is overweight so you have a,125.28,3.28
standardization,127.2,4.24
by means of bmi to say if somebody is,128.56,4.72
overweight or not that's all you need to,131.44,2.24
know,133.28,6.48
take care,133.68,6.08
