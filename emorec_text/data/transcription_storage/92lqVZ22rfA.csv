hi guys dr berg here again listen i want,0.08,4.32
to talk about the,2.72,4.559
absolute worst advice you could ever,4.4,6.4
give a diabetic okay ready for it,7.279,5.841
five small meals a day okay that's the,10.8,4.56
worst advice in fact i used to give this,13.12,4.159
advice before i knew better because i,15.36,4.56
was taught this way in school but,17.279,5.601
it is bad advice so let's talk about why,19.92,5.119
this is it has to do with,22.88,4.239
what most people are missing,25.039,4.4
in their database of knowledge about,27.119,3.841
diabetes,29.439,4.321
they might know that carbs will increase,30.96,4.72
insulin but a lot of times they do not,33.76,4.639
know that eating in general regardless,35.68,5.12
of what you eat will trigger insulin,38.399,4.081
doesn't matter what you eat every time,40.8,5.2
you eat or a snack you spike insulin,42.48,5.36
now what is,46.0,4.239
a diabetic a diabetic is someone with,47.84,6.559
too much insulin now yes if you're type,50.239,6.241
1 diabetic which you're completely burnt,54.399,4.64
out you don't have any insulin,56.48,4.64
i'm talking about the vast majority of,59.039,4.32
people who are diabetic type 2,61.12,3.759
and,63.359,4.881
they have too much insulin okay,64.879,5.121
and so that's,68.24,3.6
so what happens is they're insulin,70.0,2.96
resistance so they have to take,71.84,2.8
metformin and other,72.96,4.32
types of medications to make the insulin,74.64,4.64
connect more but if you check their,77.28,4.479
fasting insulin level it's always really,79.28,3.92
really really high,81.759,2.801
okay,83.2,2.32
now,84.56,3.12
look at this meal one two three four,85.52,3.76
five you spike insulin you spike you,87.68,3.84
spike insulin it's gonna create way too,89.28,3.68
much insulin,91.52,3.68
you're never gonna ever fix diabetes,92.96,4.56
you're gonna become a diabetic worse and,95.2,5.599
worse if you keep doing this,97.52,3.279
so here what do you do you basically we,101.119,4.0
know to cut we need to cut down,103.04,5.2
the frequency of meals this is not like,105.119,5.201
starving the person this is not,108.24,3.919
even cutting calories for cutting,110.32,4.24
calories we want to decrease,112.159,4.0
the meals,114.56,2.72
why,116.159,3.041
so we have more time in between the,117.28,3.28
meals,119.2,3.519
to keep insulin low,120.56,4.72
when you don't eat insulin goes lower,122.719,5.68
and you could heal insulin what you want,125.28,5.28
to work up to if you're a pre-diabetic,128.399,4.161
or diabetic is two meals a day,130.56,3.759
ideally it's going to take a while to do,132.56,3.28
that,134.319,3.361
but it's the ideal scene if you want to,135.84,3.92
improve your blood sugars,137.68,3.04
okay,139.76,2.72
so up to two males and then you have,140.72,4.0
more time to heal now how do you do this,142.48,4.479
how could you actually eat less and not,144.72,4.72
be so darn hungry all the time,146.959,3.36
well,149.44,2.799
you add a little more fat healthy fat to,150.319,2.961
the meal,152.239,2.0
okay,153.28,3.039
and that allows you to go longer without,154.239,4.161
being starving i'm not talking about,156.319,4.241
low-fat protein and vegetables that you,158.4,3.839
have to add the fat in there to go,160.56,3.92
longer i'll put some links down below,162.239,5.201
but the other thing is that if you eat,164.48,4.64
these small meals,167.44,3.92
you're spiking insulin insulin comes in,169.12,5.6
there lowers blood sugar okay guess what,171.36,5.84
you're going to be hungry,174.72,3.76
you're going to spike insulin again for,177.2,2.88
the next meal it's going to lower blood,178.48,4.8
sugar guess what you're going to crave,180.08,4.72
crave carbs,183.28,3.12
same thing happens over and over and,184.8,2.4
over,186.4,2.88
so if you can actually go longer keep,187.2,4.8
insulin low you can heal a lot of issues,189.28,4.48
especially,192.0,3.92
maybe even not even become not even be a,193.76,3.759
diabetic anymore,195.92,3.92
okay so i put some links down below but,197.519,4.481
this is the absolute worst advice for,199.84,4.24
diabetics so if you know a diabetic have,202.0,4.799
