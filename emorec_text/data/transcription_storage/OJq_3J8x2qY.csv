nursing manager at a local health care,13.959,3.841
facility looking back I can ever,15.639,4.111
remember an elementary school picture of,17.8,3.42
me even at a healthy weight I've always,19.75,3.539
been morbidly obese pretty much most of,21.22,4.949
my life trying multiple different diet,23.289,5.13
exercise programs and nothing seemed to,26.169,4.83
be successful I knew very little about,28.419,4.111
weight loss surgery about bariatric,30.999,3.721
surgery I decided to have weight-loss,32.53,4.53
surgery one morning after waking up and,34.72,4.74
trying to pull on a size 28 pants and,37.06,3.63
realizing that they were too tight,39.46,3.51
jumped out of bed and I told my husband,40.69,3.51
that I was interested in weight loss,42.97,3.66
surgery I made the call 204 talk to,44.2,3.84
lindsay and she had told me that there,46.63,4.08

they went to the informational seminar,67.21,4.56
meeting things went very quickly from,69.49,4.02
there from the time i went to the,71.77,3.48
seminar until the time i actually had my,73.51,4.2
surgery was only about six weeks so,75.25,4.86
things moved very quickly I did meet,77.71,5.01
with a psychiatrist met with different,80.11,4.59
physical doctors to make sure I was,82.72,3.63
cleared for surgery I did go on a,84.7,4.77
two-week clear liquid diet which I think,86.35,4.86
was the most difficult part out of,89.47,4.14
anything with with the surgery following,91.21,3.51
my surgery I was in constant,93.61,3.0
communication with dr. car boot leonel,94.72,3.36
so with Lindsay Battistelli the first,96.61,3.75
couple months I was going every couple,98.08,4.23
weeks for post-op appointments and then,100.36,3.98
it switched to every few months and then,102.31,3.86
being that I'm three years post up I,104.34,3.989
follow up with them once a year prior to,106.17,4.83
my surgery at 326 pounds I really felt,108.329,4.74
like I was just existing not even living,111.0,4.53
since then every aspect of my life has,113.069,4.5
changed I'm now able to play with my,115.53,4.35

start my own home-based business,126.81,2.91
teaching people how to cook and eat,128.099,3.571
healthier so that way they can transform,129.72,4.019
their families what I would say is,131.67,4.02
special about Henry Ford is from the,133.739,3.931
very start to the very end I felt like I,135.69,5.34
was treated with respect dignity I felt,137.67,5.97
like I was more than just a patient to,141.03,5.459
them I felt like beyond them wanting me,143.64,4.89
