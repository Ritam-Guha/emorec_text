the most beautiful thing I've ever seen,1.649,5.711
in my entire life was criss-crossing,4.06,6.24
rainbows that went on for about three,7.36,6.27
miles the colors were so vivid and the,10.3,6.65
sky was so clear it was just,13.63,6.26
unbelievable,16.95,7.24
I've lived with diabetic retinopathy as,19.89,7.479
a person who is now legally blind for,24.19,5.99
over 30 years,27.369,2.811
I was coming down this one lane road on,33.39,7.56
the hill and the minute I pulled out,38.129,5.341
onto the roadway there was a massive,40.95,5.039
hemorrhage in one eye it was instant I,43.47,5.55
completely lost the sight in that eye it,45.989,6.39
was like somebody had shot red ink into,49.02,5.55
my eye and it was just swirling swirling,52.379,6.18
swirling until it was so thick you know,54.57,6.72
I couldn't see through it you know it,58.559,4.621
was a shock because I had had diabetes,61.29,4.439
for 20 years and never had any problems,63.18,6.299
at all and then all of a sudden this,65.729,5.611
happened and I'm like oh my god you know,69.479,4.201
what's going on I was not thinking down,71.34,4.32
the road oh my gosh I want to be totally,73.68,6.35
blind and I never went there,75.66,4.37
the way diabetic retinopathy has,86.02,6.69
impacted my life has been having to,88.78,9.11
learn new ways to do almost everything,92.71,5.18
you're thinking how am I going to do,98.52,3.38
this and how am I going to do that,100.5,4.77
what's going to happen to my job how I,101.9,6.61
cook how am I going to know that if I'm,105.27,5.13
matching my clothing right,108.51,4.23
don't ever say this could never happen,110.4,6.6
to me because 45% of old adults with,112.74,11.45
diabetes have retinopathy die you take,117.0,16.22
blindness six get your eyes checked,124.19,13.32
every year,133.22,4.29
you,144.84,2.06
