"I have a very very interesting article I
want to post down below and it has to do",0.03,4.65
"with metabolic syndrome metabolic
syndrome another name for that would be",4.68,3.99
"syndrome X where your lipids like
cholesterol is too high you have insulin",8.67,5.46
"resistance you have high blood sugar
high blood pressure central obesity now",14.13,6.39
"in this article they're talking about
why metabolic syndrome should really be",20.52,3.69
"called hyperinsulinemia syndrome now the
traditional conventional viewpoint on",24.21,6.149
"this is that insulin resistance leads to
increased insulin okay but is that",30.359,8.341
"actually true is it the insulin
resistance that causes high insulin or",38.7,4.26
"is it the high insulin that causes
insulin resistance now to figure this",42.96,6.509
"out all we have to do is observe what
happens after gastric bypass where",49.469,5.16
"they're bypassing part of the small
intestine which is one part of the body",54.629,3.541
"that affects insulin the other part is
the pancreas but there's something in",58.17,4.529
"the small intestine that activates
insulin so when you do gastric bypass",62.699,4.011
"you correct part of the high insulin
problem so you reduce insulin and they",66.71,7.57
"find after this procedure that it
reverses type-2 diabetes by 83 percent",74.28,7.56
"it also reverses high blood pressure by
63 percent as well as reversing high",81.84,7.08
"cholesterol by 61 percent now let's take
a look at this diabetes type 2 that's",88.92,6.96
"high blood sugar hypertension and
cholesterol isn't that syndrome X right",95.88,5.91
"here but it also does several other
things that improve sleep apnea",101.79,3.96
"polycystic ovarian syndrome it improves
a fatty liver GERD which is a like an",105.75,5.909
"acid reflux and even joint pain now this
study that I'm basing this on is this",111.659,6.271
"very interesting because they looked at
423 other studies but focused on 58 of",117.93,7.11
"the ones that actually measured insulin
so the direct finding was if you reduce",125.04,6.15
"insulin you produced
changes across the board with so many",131.19,4.32
"different conditions and metabolic
syndrome is just kind of a collection of",135.51,3.3
"several diseases or shall we say
symptoms of this high insulin now think",138.81,8.37
"about it when you have high insulin over
a period of time the body is going to",147.18,3.57
"start to resist it the insulin receptors
are going to start to resist at high",150.75,3.87
"level so it's really high insulin that
causes the insulin resistance and of",154.62,4.86
"course once you have insulin resistance
in the bio feedback loops they're gonna",159.48,5.31
"come back and actually raise more
insulin but really only if you keep",164.79,5.34
"consuming the things that trigger
insulin carbohydrates frequent eating",170.13,5.67
"now in type 2 diabetes you have insulin
resistance and you also have high",175.8,4.439
"insulin for a period of time until the
cells that make insulin get weaker and",180.239,5.281
"weaker and weaker and that goes lower
lower lower and your blood Sugar's go",185.52,2.67
"higher and higher and higher
so you initially have high insulin and",188.19,3.0
"it kind of goes lower and in obesity you
have high insulin as well but you could",191.19,4.86
"also have diabetes type 2 and not be
overweight you can be skinny and still",196.05,5.34
"have insulin why is this so important
well if it is true that high insulin",201.39,8.18
"leads to insulin resistance that leads
to pre-diabetes and then diabetes then",209.57,6.729
"it would be very very important to
actually measure insulin early on and",216.299,6.03
"not only focus on blood sugars
identifying through a blood test what",222.329,4.38
"your insulin is doing would be the best
indicator to predict and even prevent",226.709,6.53
"insulin resistance as well as
pre-diabetes and diabetes but",233.239,5.411
"unfortunately there are certain doctors
that just don't connect the dots they're",238.65,5.04
"focused primarily on the blood sugars
and the bigger problem of that not",243.69,3.389
"understanding this concept is to
eventually start prescribing insulin to",247.079,6.451
"a diabetic type 2 I mean think about
this if you have hyperthyroidism we have",253.53,4.29
"too much thyroid hormones would you ever
give that patient more thyroid hormones",257.82,5.79
"or let's say you have a hyper cortisol
problem it's called",263.61,3.48
"Cushing's would you give that patient
high cortisol of course not but you",267.09,5.34
"would only know if they had high
cortisol or high thyroid hormone or high",272.43,3.57
"insulin if you tested it unfortunately
that's rarely tested in summary it's a",276.0,5.37
"high insulin that occurs way before the
pre-diabetes and diabetes a person will",281.37,4.829
"not have high blood sugars for many
years but they may have a lot of other",286.199,5.641
"problems that will then be treated
separately like they do with the lipids",291.84,3.87
"and high blood pressure and a lot of
these other things and lastly and more",295.71,4.44
"importantly if you're new to my channel
the the things that trigger insulin are",300.15,5.16
"primarily the overconsumption of
carbohydrates and the frequent eating",305.31,5.4
"and the snacking that people are
involved with to prevent their blood",310.71,4.05
"sugars from dropping if you want more
information on how to deal with that",314.76,3.75
