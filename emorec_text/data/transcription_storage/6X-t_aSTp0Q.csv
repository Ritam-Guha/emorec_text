the management of the patients with,4.64,6.79
diffuse large b-cell lymphoma older than,7.46,8.13
65 years is a relative change Allah for,11.43,7.26
oncologist and hematologist the,15.59,6.37
geriatric assessment could be useful in,18.69,7.14
order to stratify patients and to decide,21.96,7.619
which approach we have to use in order,25.83,6.99
to avoid another treatment for some,29.579,6.211
patients and then a more toxicity and an,32.82,5.91
under treatment and then a failure of,35.79,5.16
the figures of the treatment for the,38.73,5.28
other one the elderly project the study,40.95,5.69
we conducted the within the Italian,44.01,6.59
lymphoma foundation is a prospective,46.64,5.56
multicenter study,50.6,5.11
Amite that will validate the use of,52.2,6.51
simplified geriatric assessment in these,55.71,4.83
patients and that whether the,58.71,4.74
opportunity to integrate clinical,60.54,5.67
futures clinical prognostic factors and,63.45,5.729
the geriatric assessment for the first,66.21,5.25
time we were able to stratify patients,69.179,6.12
into three groups where the prognosis,71.46,6.06
was a significantly different,75.299,5.61
accordingly to the stratification of the,77.52,6.449
simplified geriatric assessment fit the,80.909,5.42
patients with a very good prognosis,83.969,6.36
intermediate with unfit patients a very,86.329,7.121
bad prognosis in frail patients but,90.329,5.04
because we stratified the patients,93.45,6.119
because of age in terms that the,95.369,6.661
definition of patients are older than,99.569,5.61
eight years ago so that they was not fit,102.03,8.46
for definition we resolved over a more,105.179,8.76
accurate analysis that sometimes the,110.49,6.93
patients with unfit the or frail,113.939,7.11
patients do not have any probability or,117.42,6.149
any dependence in geriatric assessing,121.049,6.42
the four we reassessed the role of age,123.569,5.961
in,127.469,6.411
within the simplify compares contents of,129.53,7.47
assessment and we divided the de,133.88,6.06
patients into three different group the,137.0,5.49
first one was the Group one that was,139.94,5.82
composed by all fit patients and unfit,142.49,5.969
the younger than eight years the second,145.76,6.36
one was damn feet older than 80 and the,148.459,6.211
frail a younger than 80 and the third,152.12,6.45
group was the patient afraid older than,154.67,5.85
eight years the survival was a,158.57,4.44
significant different and in a,160.52,4.71
multivariate analysis the three factors,163.01,5.34
were identified as the most important,165.23,5.82
influence of the survival the simplified,168.35,6.09
geriatric assessment the mo globin level,171.05,7.83
and the high P ice score so we create a,174.44,6.96
different to score a new score the,178.88,6.96
elderly prognostic index that clearly,181.4,6.03
identified three different group,185.84,4.11
operation the low-risk patients where,187.43,5.13
the score was a zero one they inter,189.95,4.65
mediate the group where the score was,192.56,6.51
from 2 to 4 and the I risk group where,194.6,8.1
the score was 5 to 7 and the clearly the,199.07,6.51
survival was a completel difference in,202.7,6.03
other words this corner can allow us to,205.58,4.98
design a new study in the clinical,208.73,3.99
practice in order to have the,210.56,4.679
opportunity to better stratify the,212.72,5.94
patients that it then be we have to be,215.239,5.731
enrolled in there in the clinical trials,218.66,5.97
and in the in other world we have a more,220.97,7.76
comfortable approach to these patients,224.63,4.1
