so the goals of our study were to find,9.3,5.549
out if it's a good idea to give high,11.91,5.93
dose B vitamins to patients who have,14.849,5.07
diabetic kidney damage,17.84,5.02
it's called diabetic nephropathy what we,19.919,5.911
found out was that high-dose vitamins,22.86,6.23
made the kidney function decline faster,25.83,7.369
than the non active placebo tablets and,29.09,6.219
patients who were randomized to,33.199,4.961
high-dose vitamin had a higher risk of,35.309,4.471
strokes and heart attacks over the,38.16,5.19
3-year follow-up so we were shocked,39.78,6.989
actually by the results when the when I,43.35,6.54
first saw the results I thought maybe we,46.769,6.78
had the randomization code reversed but,49.89,5.729
we checked and sure enough patients on,53.549,4.921
the active high-dose vitamins had lower,55.619,5.851
levels of a blood clotting factor called,58.47,5.04
homocysteine which is why we were giving,61.47,4.469
them the vitamin so that their Animas,63.51,4.679
ation code was correct so diabetic,65.939,4.801
nephropathy is kidney damage from the,68.189,5.941
diabetes it's thought to be largely due,70.74,6.15
to damage to the small artery branches,74.13,6.379
in the kidneys called arterioles and,76.89,7.049
it's known that homocysteine aggravates,80.509,5.71
the function of those arterioles and,83.939,4.381
that's why we thought lowering,86.219,3.69
homocysteine levels should make the,88.32,5.939
kidney function better so that's why,89.909,6.63
we're so surprised that it didn't people,94.259,5.18
with diabetic nephropathy and,96.539,6.78
significant kidney impairment impairment,99.439,6.43
of kidney function should probably stop,103.319,5.19
taking high-dose B vitamins it doesn't,105.869,5.82
mean they can't take low doses and the,108.509,7.74
reasons we think for our results are,111.689,6.42
that these B vitamins are normally,116.249,4.26
excreted in the kidney for from the via,118.109,5.33
the kidney and so we're concerned that,120.509,6.24
because the kidney function was impaired,123.439,6.371
these patients may have not been able to,126.749,4.861
get rid of the high dose vitamin C the,129.81,3.27
normal way and they may have built up,131.61,4.23
toxic doses there have been a number of,133.08,5.34
fairly large randomized control trials,135.84,5.37
showing no harm of vitamins in people,138.42,3.47
with nor,141.21,3.35
kidney function this is the first study,141.89,4.56
that I know of that's clearly showing,144.56,4.89
harm of high-dose vitamin C and people,146.45,6.5
with impaired kidney function one of the,149.45,6.03
consequences of this study is that it,152.95,3.82
means we're going to have to look at,155.48,2.64
other ways of lowering homocysteine,156.77,4.56
levels in patients with kidney failure,158.12,4.65
and that's something we've been working,161.33,5.22
on with medications called thiols that,162.77,6.54
that bind homocysteine and get rid of it,166.55,3.96
through the kidneys or through a,169.31,3.69
dialysis machine there are quite a few,170.51,4.68
people presently taking high-dose,173.0,7.56
vitamin C to lower homocysteine and what,175.19,7.11
this means is that if they have kidney,180.56,3.959
failure they shouldn't be doing that the,182.3,4.05
study will be published in JAMA the,184.519,3.181
