most of us would assume that fruits are,3.649,4.17
a high glycemic car because they're so,5.99,4.2
sweet but the simple thing is fruit is,7.819,4.171
metabolized differently and in this,10.19,3.63
video I want to explain what the five,11.99,4.859
lowest glycemic fruits are that you can,13.82,4.349
eat especially as we're getting into,16.849,3.061
summertime you're going to want to start,18.169,3.061
eating a little bit more that fresh,19.91,3.75
fruit the number five low glycemic fruit,21.23,3.9
is cantaloupe melon,23.66,3.509
now melons in general are pretty low,25.13,4.17
glycemic but cantaloupe takes the cake,27.169,3.93
and it's also exceptionally high in,29.3,4.68
vitamin K which is necessary in order to,31.099,5.67
absorb vitamin D so it also has some,33.98,4.44
crucial minerals to it now here's an,36.769,2.851
extra little bonus when it comes to,38.42,2.729
cantaloupe if you eat the cantaloupe,39.62,3.209
seeds which mind you don't taste all,41.149,4.23
that amazing they are an extremely,42.829,5.311
jam-packed source of omega-3 fatty acids,45.379,4.291
so not only are you getting the low,48.14,3.75
glycemic fructose of a cantaloupe but,49.67,3.63
you're also getting the same effect that,51.89,3.149
you might get from say fish oil pills,53.3,4.019
now number four you probably didn't even,55.039,3.991
think this one was a fruit and that's,57.319,4.141
avocados you see avocados technically,59.03,4.439
are a fruit and they do have a glycemic,61.46,3.57
load which means they are going to raise,63.469,3.091
your blood sugar a little bit but,65.03,3.33
there's such a high source of omega-3s,66.56,3.36
and such a high source of healthy fats,68.36,4.35
it slows the breakdown of those carbs,69.92,4.32
now number three is going to be our,72.71,3.69
friend grapefruit and grapefruits aren't,74.24,3.63
always the sweetest fruit in the world,76.4,3.99
but they're definitely beneficial when,77.87,4.02
it comes to your health and the reason,80.39,3.78
is because they are shown to lower blood,81.89,4.23
lipid levels they're shown to lower,84.17,4.41
cholesterol so in addition to being a,86.12,4.44
great source of B vitamins they're also,88.58,3.69
going to help you reduce the levels of,90.56,3.81
fat in your bloodstream they're going to,92.27,3.36
help you lower those levels of,94.37,3.09
cholesterol so you can get on to living,95.63,3.57
a healthier life now the number two low,97.46,3.33
glycemic fruit is one of my personal,99.2,3.99
favorites and that is a plum the reason,100.79,4.2
that they're so low glycemic is because,103.19,3.6
of the effect they have on the digestive,104.99,3.45
system you see they're a little bit,106.79,3.3
slower to digest and they're also high,108.44,2.34
in fiber,110.09,2.52
hence the old eating prunes to help,110.78,3.81
digestion kind of thing prunes are just,112.61,4.32
dried plums you all know how big I am,114.59,4.41
when it comes to healthy digestion so if,116.93,3.93
you can eat a few plums you're getting,119.0,3.75
that low glycemic effect that low level,120.86,4.2
of sugar but you're also getting enough,122.75,3.66
fiber that's going to slow the,125.06,2.94
absorption of that sugar so you don't,126.41,3.209
have the quick surge of it affecting,128.0,3.42
your body and convincing your liver to,129.619,4.581
store it as fat the number one low,131.42,5.85
glycemic fruit is a strawberry,134.2,5.23
and if you ever look at a package of,137.27,3.57
strawberries or you ever look at the,139.43,3.72
nutrition facts on the strawberry you'll,140.84,4.08
find that it takes quite a few,143.15,4.08
strawberries even to get yourself to say,144.92,4.98
10 or 15 grams of carbs so in addition,147.23,5.46
to being low in terms of overall carbs,149.9,5.61
the actual glycemic load of those carbs,152.69,5.73
is exceptionally low so if you're going,155.51,4.59
to indulge I definitely recommend,158.42,3.96
hitting up the berries adding them to,160.1,4.38
your pre-workout meal and getting the,162.38,4.02
benefit of not only a low glycemic carb,164.48,4.11
but also some antioxidant and,166.4,4.23
anti-inflammatory benefits see you in,168.59,4.61
