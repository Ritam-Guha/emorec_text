symptomatic but still if you want to,36.8,4.0
understand what are the symptoms here we,38.96,3.2
go these are the symptoms that are,40.8,3.68
listed but actually there are diabetes,42.16,5.28
symptoms common for men and women both,44.48,4.8
these cases there are common symptoms,47.44,3.76
and these are all among those common,49.28,3.84
symptoms that are found both in men as,51.2,3.359
well as in women,53.12,3.04
but there are other symptoms and the,54.559,4.0
variations slides some of the symptoms,56.16,5.12
are more common in men than women so we,58.559,4.8
are going to talk about them as well so,61.28,4.4
begin with the common symptoms let's say,63.359,4.161
first of all the diabetes symptom number,65.68,4.16
one is urination frequent urination you,67.52,4.0
need to go to the bathroom quite often,69.84,3.52
mostly in the night times even after the,71.52,3.76
meal you know blood glucose level is too,73.36,4.48
high and your kidneys working too hard,75.28,4.4
to take that glucose out of the body,77.84,3.68
that's why they produce more and more,79.68,4.64
urine and put it outside now as it is,81.52,5.44
excluding those uh sugar out of your,84.32,4.56
body it is also excluding the water from,86.96,3.76
your body so you need to take a lot,88.88,4.64
water after that so increased thrust is,90.72,5.28
also related with this urination second,93.52,4.48
thing is a fatty you feel very much,96.0,4.0
tired all the time and too much,98.0,3.6
irritated about small things in your,100.0,3.68
life this can be a result this can be a,101.6,4.4
symptom of many disease but it is also,103.68,4.719
related symptom for diabetes in men,106.0,4.64
second thing a third one is the hunger,108.399,3.281
so,110.64,3.2
diabetes symptoms in men hunger is very,111.68,4.32
common and even after eating something,113.84,4.0
right it's kind of weird right you eat,116.0,3.759
something and you feel hungry more,117.84,3.44
because of you know after eating,119.759,3.04
something your blood glucose level goes,121.28,4.08
too high it causes the hunger more,122.799,4.32
because you know inside the cell as a,125.36,3.84
result of diabetes the cell will not,127.119,4.081
receive that glucose due to the less,129.2,3.6
amount of insulin that is a hormone,131.2,3.36
which controls the balance of this,132.8,3.84
glucose in your body and cell won't get,134.56,4.24
it so cell try to get more and more food,136.64,3.52
more and more glucose you feel more,138.8,2.32
hungry,140.16,3.52
kind of weird then we have bloody vision,141.12,4.64
bloody vision means you know due to the,143.68,4.559
production of high glucose level in your,145.76,3.6
blood,148.239,3.761
what happens actually uh it kind of uh,149.36,4.56
make your lens you know islands that you,152.0,3.84
can see here the lens start to distort,153.92,4.0
as a result you feel blurred vision not,155.84,3.44
a good sign,157.92,3.679
then the diabetes symptom number five,159.28,4.16
that is slow healing source if you have,161.599,4.161
small wounds in your hand or leg,163.44,4.799
whatever it is it might take a long time,165.76,4.72
to heal so these are kind of common,168.239,4.64
symptoms that we can find both in men as,170.48,4.399
well as women during the type 2 diabetes,172.879,4.161
conditions or pre-diabetic conditions,174.879,4.0
but there are some specific things for,177.04,4.24
male and more common for male for,178.879,5.121
example infections infections also are,181.28,4.319
kind of seen in men and women but,184.0,3.599
different kinds of infection infections,185.599,4.0
in genitalia is pretty much common,187.599,3.681
because a certain kind of you know urine,189.599,3.36
infection is very much common during the,191.28,4.4
time because it was kind of uh in the,192.959,4.161
studies that,195.68,3.839
during this high blood sugar level what,197.12,3.839
happens uh,199.519,3.281
the strategy of your body to fight,200.959,2.881
against the infection that is the,202.8,3.12
immunity of our body kind of goes down,203.84,3.52
that's why infections are pretty much,205.92,4.16
common then so that thing is another uh,207.36,4.799
part and another important thing about,210.08,4.799
the main particularly main uh symptoms,212.159,5.521
