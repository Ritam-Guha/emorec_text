tons of diets out there recommend eating,0.16,4.8
low glycemic index foods but what,2.0,5.52
exactly is the glycemic index let's,4.96,5.12
science it,7.52,2.56
hey welcome to nourishment i'm dr lara,11.28,4.559
the glycemic index or gi is a method,13.28,4.72
used to rank foods based on how they,15.839,4.481
impact your blood glucose does eating,18.0,4.0
this apple make your blood sugar spike,20.32,4.4
super high and super fast or is the rise,22.0,5.119
more gradual it was originally created,24.72,4.479
to help people with diabetes select,27.119,4.56
foods to improve their glycemic control,29.199,5.681
by ranking foods as low medium or high,31.679,4.241
gi,34.88,2.96
you can't just guess the gi of a food by,35.92,4.0
looking at the food label it has to be,37.84,4.719
tested in order to express the impact of,39.92,4.799
a particular food we need a reference to,42.559,4.401
compare it to and we want this reference,44.719,4.401
to be something that has maximum spike,46.96,5.04
potential enter the sugar drink,49.12,5.2
50 grams of pure sucrose dissolved in,52.0,4.559
water requires little digestion so the,54.32,4.399
glucose can be rapidly absorbed into the,56.559,4.241
bloodstream so i've fasted for over 12,58.719,3.441
hours and i haven't had any physical,60.8,3.759
activity this morning and so now i can,62.16,5.12
drink my pure sugar drink and i'm using,64.559,5.521
a continuous glucose monitor to measure,67.28,5.28
my blood glucose every five minutes,70.08,4.719
cheers,72.56,5.919
oh my goodness that's so sweet,74.799,3.68
okay and now i'm going to sit tight for,79.119,5.201
two hours so we can see the impact on my,81.84,5.04
blood glucose so we see a pretty rapid,84.32,4.799
spike in blood glucose it looks like it,86.88,4.559
peaks 45 minutes after the drink and,89.119,4.721
then normalizes back to baseline around,91.439,4.881
75 minutes so it's the next day and now,93.84,4.0
we can do an experiment to find out the,96.32,4.159
glycemic index of a particular test food,97.84,4.559
so i'm going to test this,100.479,4.721
dave's killer bread the 21 whole grains,102.399,6.0
and seed version not an ad just a fan so,105.2,5.04
we want to compare like to like and,108.399,4.161
yesterday i drank a sugar beverage with,110.24,4.72
50 grams of sugar so it's 50 grams of,112.56,4.559
digestible carbohydrate so today i'm,114.96,4.32
going to eat a serving of bread that,117.119,4.561
also gives me 50 grams of digestible,119.28,4.879
carbohydrate now that word digestible is,121.68,5.2
actually important because products like,124.159,4.16
whole wheat breads and other fruits and,126.88,3.84
vegetables they also contain fiber which,128.319,4.161
is a carbohydrate but we can't actually,130.72,4.0
digest it so when we're looking at the,132.48,4.0
serving size that we want to eat to make,134.72,3.44
sure we get 50 grams of digestible,136.48,3.6
carbohydrate we have to actually,138.16,4.32
subtract the fiber from the total,140.08,4.799
carbohydrates in the product so when i,142.48,4.64
look at the nutrition facts panel what i,144.879,5.201
see is one slice of bread has 22 grams,147.12,5.28
of carbohydrates in it but five of those,150.08,5.04
grams are fiber so i take 22 minus five,152.4,4.88
to get 17 grams of digestible,155.12,4.24
carbohydrate per slice and so if i want,157.28,4.959
to get 50 grams total then i need to eat,159.36,5.84
almost three full slices of bread still,162.239,8.441
not my typical breakfast but here we go,165.2,5.48
those killer seeds in this graph we see,172.879,4.561
my blood glucose to the sugar drink in,175.2,4.88
red and to the bread in blue,177.44,4.48
it's pretty striking how different they,180.08,3.92
are over the two hours the bread caused,181.92,4.319
a much more gradual rise in blood,184.0,4.879
glucose and the peak was substantially,186.239,5.521
lower compared to the sugar drink now to,188.879,4.961
actually calculate the glycemic index we,191.76,4.08
need to calculate the area under the,193.84,4.16
curve for both the sugar drink and the,195.84,3.84
bread separately,198.0,3.92
then we divide the bread test area by,199.68,4.479
the sugar drink reference and multiply,201.92,5.039
by 100 to express it as a percent,204.159,5.041
using this method the glycemic index for,206.959,4.881
dave's killer seed bread is,209.2,5.679
which puts it in the low gi category,211.84,4.88
from this n of one experiment we,214.879,3.841
observed that dave's killer seed bread,216.72,4.72
raises my blood glucose only 34 percent,218.72,4.96
as much as sugar drink over a two-hour,221.44,3.28
period,223.68,2.8
i was actually pretty surprised at how,224.72,4.079
low the gi for this bread was i,226.48,4.24
definitely expected it to be lower than,228.799,4.481
the sugar drink due to the fiber content,230.72,4.879
since fiber slows down the absorption of,233.28,4.72
glucose but i really didn't think that,235.599,5.2
it would be categorized as a low gi food,238.0,5.2
because it's still bread and the reality,240.799,4.961
is it might not be we can't exactly,243.2,4.64
conclude that the gi of dave's killer,245.76,5.119
seed bread is for sure 34 just from this,247.84,4.16
experiment,250.879,2.961
determining the gi of a food needs to be,252.0,3.76
done in a larger sample of study,253.84,4.399
participants than just me and each,255.76,4.479
participant needs to do the experiment,258.239,4.721
in duplicate or triplicate meaning,260.239,4.481
drinking the sugar drink on three,262.96,4.0
separate days and eating the test food,264.72,4.16
on three separate days,266.96,4.08
usually that sugar drink is made of pure,268.88,4.319
glucose rather than the sucrose table,271.04,4.64
sugar that i used it also turns out that,273.199,4.56
there's a few more complications about,275.68,5.04
the glycemic index and its applicability,277.759,4.88
i dig into all of this in my video,280.72,4.96
