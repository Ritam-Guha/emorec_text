i'd had health issues off and on for,0.399,4.641
several years i was in the process of,2.96,4.64
changing doctors the doctor had,5.04,4.16
asked me to come in and do some initial,7.6,3.999
setup work do blood tests blood work and,9.2,4.08
things like that,11.599,4.0
and he then called me a few days later,13.28,3.839
after i'd done the initial blood work,15.599,4.401
and said i need to see you today,17.119,4.801
at that point my,20.0,4.88
stomach fell out of me i was terrified,21.92,3.84
because,24.88,2.719
it was just scary,25.76,4.24
and at that point i went in and spoke,27.599,4.401
with him and he said,30.0,4.88
your blood tests are back and you're,32.0,4.64
borderline diabetic i want to throw you,34.88,3.359
into the diabetic category but i want to,36.64,3.68
give you a chance to remedy the,38.239,3.761
situation first,40.32,4.079
i was aware of pre-diabetes as a,42.0,3.6
condition,44.399,3.521
it was somewhat foreign to me,45.6,3.68
because it was just something that i'd,47.92,3.36
heard about kind of vaguely off of the,49.28,3.52
periphery somewhere,51.28,4.88
but once i heard about it once he said,52.8,6.48
you have this or you're borderline,56.16,5.919
diabetic at that point i started doing,59.28,5.36
some research about what do i need to do,62.079,4.961
what are treatment options is there a,64.64,4.64
way to come back from this,67.04,3.119
and,69.28,2.72
at that point i kind of made a,70.159,3.681
resolution to myself that i was going to,72.0,4.24
make some changes in my life and,73.84,3.52
try to,76.24,3.04
do something to remedy this,77.36,3.84
people at the diabetes resource center,79.28,5.04
provided an excellent framework in that,81.2,4.72
they looked at all of the things that,84.32,3.68
you know how to do for the most part i,85.92,3.68
mean eat less,88.0,4.72
calories work out more but they gave you,89.6,5.6
specific and focused,92.72,5.12
direction as to what particular things,95.2,5.12
that you either doing improperly or you,97.84,4.319
need to do better,100.32,4.32
they were mentors they were,102.159,6.161
encouraging they were always friendly,104.64,6.799
they weren't negative about aspects they,108.32,4.88
would they would nudge you in the right,111.439,3.521
direction,113.2,4.239
if i had not gotten this diagnosis,114.96,3.28
i,117.439,3.921
probably would be in a situation where,118.24,6.08
five years down the road i'd be 260 270,121.36,5.439
pounds still still eating on the road,124.32,4.159
and not really paying attention to what,126.799,4.961
i was eating i would be diabetic i might,128.479,4.881
have a stroke at some point in the not,131.76,4.16
too distant future,133.36,5.04
just just generally not healthy i,135.92,4.56
probably wouldn't see my son graduate,138.4,4.479
high school or college and get married,140.48,3.36
and,142.879,2.321
wouldn't be able to live a long life,143.84,3.36
with my wife and those are things that,145.2,4.08
are very important to me,147.2,5.6
my message to a pre-diabetic would be,149.28,6.48
that small steps at first will get you a,152.8,4.48
long way,155.76,3.839
back away from,157.28,5.039
diabetic condition of any type it's not,159.599,5.601
difficult necessarily but you do have to,162.319,4.64
make some changes and you do have to,165.2,5.759
make some decisions on what's important,166.959,4.0
