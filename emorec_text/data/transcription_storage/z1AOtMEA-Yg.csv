hey guys dr. Burke here in this video,0.03,3.119
we're gonna talk about the two most,1.319,5.101
ignored minerals and diabetes okay so,3.149,6.541
this is really cool information this is,6.42,5.07
very powerful if you are a diabetic or,9.69,3.569
if you're a pre-diabetic and you have,11.49,3.269
infinite resistance and what I mean by,13.259,3.481
that is if you have belly fat if you,14.759,4.801
have a fatty liver if you're tired after,16.74,3.51
eating,19.56,2.7
if you can't go between meals without,20.25,4.65
being very hungry if you feel better,22.26,5.88
when you eat if you have swell a swollen,24.9,4.77
belly if you actually have sweet,28.14,2.729
cravings or high blood pressure those,29.67,3.9
are all signs of insulin resistance if,30.869,4.861
you have that you this videos for you,33.57,4.02
there are two minerals one is potassium,35.73,3.27
and one is magnesium,37.59,4.469
now magnesium makes an enzymes to help,39.0,5.73
lower the blood sugar faciem is involved,42.059,5.971
with helping the storage of sugar called,44.73,5.91
glycogen so your body will store sugar,48.03,5.07
in between meals and your liver and your,50.64,3.87
muscles so if you don't have that,53.1,4.08
capacity it could be because you don't,54.51,4.77
have no potassium but here's the thing,57.18,4.49
that's that people don't realize insulin,59.28,5.94
triggers the absorption uptake of both,61.67,5.79
potassium and magnesium in the cell,65.22,5.61
without insulin you cannot absorb,67.46,8.65
magnesium or potassium okay so right,70.83,6.21
there that's going to create a,76.11,3.0
deficiency and then both of these,77.04,4.469
actions to lower the blood sugars and,79.11,3.63
the storage of glycogen aren't gonna,81.509,3.631
happen so you have a double-edged sword,82.74,6.08
so what happens is when you increase,85.14,6.81
magnesium and potassium or just normal,88.82,6.49
if you just have the normal amount you,91.95,5.01
can decrease the need for instance you,95.31,4.769
can actually help heal the sensitivity,96.96,5.519
to glucose and the insulin resistance,100.079,4.011
and I'm gonna put some links down below,102.479,3.721
that there's studies that show that you,104.09,4.87
can take these two minerals and greatly,106.2,5.79
improve if not fix insulin resistance of,108.96,4.949
course you have to change your diet and,111.99,3.449
things like that but that's very very,113.909,4.35
amazing that these two minerals can,115.439,4.5
actually lower the need for insulin and,118.259,3.531
then when you lower the need for insulin,119.939,4.47
now you have enough insulin to pull in,121.79,5.74
these minerals into the cell and it just,124.409,5.82
will all work out real nicely okay now,127.53,3.959
the other thing is that hypercalcemia,130.229,3.62
that's too much calcium,131.489,4.131
if you look that up and I put a link,133.849,3.961
down below that can cause diabetes,135.62,4.619
that's one of the interesting side,137.81,4.17
effects from having hypercalcemia cause,140.239,2.461
of diabetes,141.98,2.22
probably because when you have too much,142.7,5.25
calcium calcium it can lock up magnesium,144.2,5.64
because calcium magnesium work together,147.95,4.53
so if you have soft tissue calcium and,149.84,4.58
spurring arthritis and things like that,152.48,7.5
or taking tums or calcium carbonate you,154.42,7.299
know you're not taking up magnesium just,159.98,4.47
straight calcium carbonate you know,161.719,4.261
especially if you're an anti acids that,164.45,4.819
can set you up for diabetes interesting,165.98,6.33
that's probably also why vitamin d3 in,169.269,5.741
k2 improve diabetes as well I put some,172.31,3.929
links down below for that too so,175.01,2.97
probably because this mobilizes the,176.239,5.33
calcium and frees up the magnesium so,177.98,8.28
how can you get these minerals well this,181.569,6.191
will happens they're both in the same,186.26,5.099
food vegetables yeah so we keep coming,187.76,5.369
back to this vegetable thing right you,191.359,4.261
need 7 to 10 cups of vegetables every,193.129,4.95
single day you can do in the blender you,195.62,5.339
can do it in a salad it's not that hard,198.079,6.78
but it's very important to get that,200.959,6.601
amount because if you're doing 7 to 10,204.859,4.231
cups to your potassium you're gonna,207.56,3.539
easily get the magnesium because,209.09,4.019
magnesium is in the fan vegetables you,211.099,3.66
don't need as much you need about take,213.109,4.53
450 milligrams but you need 4700,214.759,5.19
milligrams of potassium so here's what I,217.639,5.97
want you to do for the next week go,219.949,5.4
ahead and start consuming more,223.609,4.41
vegetables you'll increase these and,225.349,4.801
just see if any of these symptoms start,228.019,5.19
going away then you'll know that this is,230.15,5.519
what caused or contributed to your,233.209,4.381
problem in the first place alright,235.669,4.47
thanks for watching oh and I'll check,237.59,5.299
out your comments below,240.139,2.75
